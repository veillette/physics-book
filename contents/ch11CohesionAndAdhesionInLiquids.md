### Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids

Children blow soap bubbles and play in the spray of a sprinkler on a hot summer
day. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) An underwater spider keeps his air supply in
a shiny bubble he carries wrapped around him. A technician draws blood into a
small-diameter tube just by touching it to a drop on a pricked finger. A
premature infant struggles to inflate her lungs. What is the common thread? All
these activities are dominated by the attractive forces between atoms and
molecules in liquids—both within a liquid and between the liquid and its
surroundings.

Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called **cohesive
forces**. Liquids can, for example, be held in open containers because cohesive
forces hold the molecules together. Attractive forces between molecules of
different types are called **adhesive forces**. Such forces cause liquid drops
to cling to window panes, for example. In this section we examine effects
directly attributable to cohesive and adhesive forces in liquids.

### Surface Tension

Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to
the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called **surface
tension**. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces,
reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net
force, since they have neighbors on all sides.

Making Connections: Surface Tension
</div>
Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon.

</div>

The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can
effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk
on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they
dent the surface as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(a). [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(
b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron
needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of
water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that
try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down
on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and
it would sink.

![A leg of an insect resting on the water surface is shown in the first figure. In the second figure an iron needle rests on the surface of water without sinking. Both are possible due to the tension on the surface of the liquid.](../resources/Figure_11_08_03.jpg 'Surface tension supporting the weight of an insect and an iron needle, both of which rest on the surface without penetrating it. They are not floating; rather, they are supported by the surface of the liquid. (a) An insect leg dents the water surface. ( F_\\text{ST}) is a restoring force (surface tension) parallel to the surface. (b) An iron needle similarly dents a water surface until the restoring force (surface tension) grows to equal its weight.')
{: #Figure2}

Surface tension is proportional to the strength of the cohesive force, which
varies with the type of liquid. Surface tension $$\gamma $$ is defined to be the
force _F_ per unit length $$L $$ exerted by a stretched liquid membrane:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma =\frac{F}{L}. $$
</div>

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists values of $$\gamma $$ for some liquids. For the
insect of [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(a), its weight $$w $$ is supported by the
upward components of the surface tension force: $$w=\gamma L \sin \theta $$ ,
where $$L $$ is the circumference of the insect’s foot in contact with the
water. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows one way to measure surface tension. The
liquid film exerts a force on the movable wire in an attempt to reduce its
surface area. The magnitude of this force depends on the surface tension of the
liquid and can be measured accurately.

Surface tension is the reason why liquids form bubbles and droplets. The inward
surface tension force causes bubbles to be approximately spherical and raises
the pressure of the gas trapped inside relative to atmospheric pressure outside.
It can be shown that the gauge pressure $$P $$ inside a spherical bubble is
given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{4\gamma }{r}, $$
</div>

where $$r $$ is the radius of the bubble. Thus the pressure inside a bubble is
greatest when the bubble is the smallest. Another bit of evidence for this is
illustrated in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). When air is allowed to flow between two
balloons of unequal size, the smaller balloon tends to collapse, filling the
larger balloon.

![Sliding wire device which is used to measure surface tension shows the force exerted on the two surfaces of the liquid. This force remains a constant until the film’s breaking point.](../resources/Figure_11_08_04.jpg 'Sliding wire device used for measuring surface tension; the device exerts a force to reduce the film’s surface area. The force needed to hold the wire in place is ( F=\\gamma L=\\gamma (2l) ), since there are two liquid surfaces attached to the wire. This force remains nearly constant as the film is stretched, until the film approaches its breaking point.')

Upon opening the valve, the smaller balloon decreases in size with the air moving to fill the larger balloon. The pressure in a spherical balloon is inversely proportional to its radius, so that the smaller balloon has a greater internal pressure than the larger balloon, resulting in this flow.')

Surface Tension: Pressure Inside a Bubble
</div>
Calculate the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble  $$ 2.00 \times 10^{-4}  \text{m} $$
 in radius using the surface tension for soapy water in [[Table 1]](#Table1). Convert this pressure to mm Hg.

**Strategy**

The radius is given and the surface tension can be found in [[Table 1]](#Table1)
, and so $$P $$ can be found directly from the equation $$P=\frac{4\gamma }{r}

$$
.

**Solution**

Substituting $$r $$ and $$\gamma $$ into the equation $$P=\frac{4\gamma }{r} $$
, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{4\gamma }{r}=\frac{4\left(0.037 \text{N/m}\right)}{ 2.00 \times 10^{-4}  \text{m}}=740 {\text{N/m}}^{2}=740 \text{Pa}. $$
</div>
We use a conversion factor to get this into units of mm Hg:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\left(740 {\text{N/m}}^{2}\right)\frac{1.00 \text{mm Hg}}{133 {\text{N/m}}^{2}}=5.56 \text{mm Hg} . $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Note that if a hole were to be made in the bubble, the air would be forced out,
the bubble would decrease in radius, and the pressure inside would *increase* to
atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg).

</div>

Our lungs contain hundreds of millions of mucus-lined sacs called *alveoli*,
which are very similar in size, and about 0.1 mm in diameter. (
See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) You can exhale without muscle action by allowing
surface tension to contract these sacs. Medical patients whose breathing is
aided by a positive pressure respirator have air blown into the lungs, but are
generally allowed to exhale on their own. Even if there is paralysis, surface
tension in the alveoli will expel air from the lungs. Since pressure increases
as the radii of the alveoli decrease, an occasional deep cleansing breath is
needed to fully reinflate the alveoli. Respirators are programmed to do this and
we find it natural, as do our companion dogs and cats, to take a cleansing
breath before settling into a nap.

![The alveoli at the end of the lung tubes enable exhalation and do not allow inhalation due to the surface tension of the mucous lining.](../resources/Figure_11_08_06.jpg "Bronchial tubes in the lungs branch into ever-smaller structures, finally ending in alveoli. The alveoli act like tiny bubbles. The surface tension of their mucous lining aids in exhalation and can prevent inhalation if too great.")
{: #Figure5}

The tension in the walls of the alveoli results from the membrane tissue and a
liquid on the walls of the alveoli containing a long lipoprotein that acts as a
surfactant (a surface-tension reducing substance). The need for the surfactant
results from the tendency of small alveoli to collapse and the air to fill into
the larger alveoli making them even larger (as demonstrated
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). During inhalation, the lipoprotein molecules are
pulled apart and the wall tension increases as the radius increases (increased
surface tension). During exhalation, the molecules slide back together and the
surface tension decreases, helping to prevent a collapse of the alveoli. The
surfactant therefore serves to change the wall tension so that small alveoli
don’t collapse and large alveoli are prevented from expanding too much. This
tension change is a unique property of these surfactants, and is not shared by
detergents (which simply lower surface tension). (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).)

![Graph of surface tension as a function of surface area for detergents and interstitial fluids.](../resources/Figure_11_08_07.jpg "Surface tension as a function of surface area. The surface tension for lung surfactant decreases with decreasing area. This ensures that small alveoli don&#x2019;t collapse and large alveoli are not able to over expand. ")
{: #Figure6}

If water gets into the lungs, the surface tension is too great and you cannot
inhale. This is a severe problem in resuscitating drowning victims. A similar
problem occurs in newborn infants who are born without this surfactant—their
lungs are very difficult to inflate. This condition is known as *hyaline
membrane disease* and is a leading cause of death for infants, particularly in
premature births. Some success has been achieved in treating hyaline membrane
disease by spraying a surfactant into the infant’s breathing passages. Emphysema
produces the opposite problem with alveoli. Alveolar walls of emphysema victims
deteriorate, and the sacs combine to form larger sacs. Because pressure produced
by surface tension decreases with increasing radius, these larger sacs produce
smaller pressure, reducing the ability of emphysema victims to exhale. A common
test for emphysema is to measure the pressure and volume of air that can be
exhaled.

Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation

(1) Try floating a sewing needle on water. In order for this activity to work, the needle needs to be very clean as even the oil from your fingers can be sufficient to affect the surface properties of the needle. (2) Place the bristles of a paint brush into water. Pull the brush out and notice that for a short while, the bristles will stick together. The surface tension of the water surrounding the bristles is sufficient to hold the bristles together. As the bristles dry out, the surface tension effect dissipates. (3) Place a loop of thread on the surface of still water in such a way that all of the thread is in contact with the water. Note the shape of the loop. Now place a drop of detergent into the middle of the loop. What happens to the shape of the loop? Why? (4) Sprinkle pepper onto the surface of water. Add a drop of detergent. What happens? Why? (5) Float two matches parallel to each other and add a drop of detergent between them. What happens?

### Adhesion and Capillary Action

Why is it that water beads up on a waxed car but does not on bare paint? The
answer is that the adhesive forces between water and wax are much smaller than
those between water and paint. Competition between the forces of adhesion and
cohesion are important in the macroscopic behavior of liquids. An important
factor in studying the roles of these two forces is the angle $$\theta $$
between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface. (
See [[Figure 7]](#Figure7).) The **contact angle**  $$\theta $$ is directly
related to the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The larger
the strength of the cohesive force relative to the adhesive force, the larger
$$\theta $$ is, and the more the liquid tends to form a droplet. The smaller
$$\theta $$ is, the smaller the relative strength, so that the adhesive force is
able to flatten the drop. [[Table 2]](#Table2) lists contact angles for several
combinations of liquids and solids.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Contact Angle
</div>
The angle  $$\theta  $$
 between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface is called the contact angle.

</div>

![Water is seen to make beads on the waxed surface of car paint and it remains flat on the surface without wax. The beads are due to the greater force of attraction between the water molecules than between the water molecules and the surface. On the surface without wax the force of attraction between the water molecules and paint is greater.](../resources/Figure_11_08_08.jpg "In the photograph, water beads on the waxed car paint and flattens on the unwaxed paint. (a) Water forms beads on the waxed surface because the cohesive forces responsible for surface tension are larger than the adhesive forces, which tend to flatten the drop. (b) Water beads on bare paint are flattened considerably because the adhesive forces between water and paint are strong, overcoming surface tension. The contact angle \( \theta \) is directly related to the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The larger \( \theta \) is, the larger the ratio of cohesive to adhesive forces. (credit: P. P. Urone)")
{: #Figure7}

One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and
adhesive forces is **capillary action**—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or
suppressed in a narrow tube, or *capillary tube*. This action causes blood to be
drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Capillary Action
</div>
The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action.

</div>

If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown
in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8), capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid
inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect
depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus,
the contact angle $$\theta $$ given in the table. If $$\theta $$ is less than
$$90º $$ , then the fluid will be raised; if $$\theta $$ is greater than $$90º
$$ , it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large surface
tension and a large contact angle with glass. When placed in a tube, the surface
of a column of mercury curves downward, somewhat like a drop. The curved surface
of a fluid in a tube is called a **meniscus**. The tendency of surface tension
is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved
liquid surface in a capillary tube. This results in a downward force in mercury
and an upward force in water, as seen in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8).

![Mercury kept in a container into which a narrow tube is inserted lowers its level inside the tube relative to the level in the rest of the container. In a similar situation, water rises in the tube so that the water level in the tube is above the water level in the rest of the container. This phenomenon is due to the large contact angle of mercury with glass and the smaller contact angle of water with glass.](../resources/Figure_11_08_09.jpg "(a) Mercury is suppressed in a glass tube because its contact angle is greater than 90&#xBA;. Surface tension exerts a downward force as it flattens the mercury, suppressing it in the tube. The dashed line shows the shape the mercury surface would have without the flattening effect of surface tension. (b) Water is raised in a glass tube because its contact angle is nearly 0&#xBA;. Surface tension therefore exerts an upward force when it flattens the surface to reduce its area.")

Capillary action can move liquids horizontally over very large distances, but
the height to which it can raise or suppress a liquid in a tube is limited by
its weight. It can be shown that this height $$h $$ is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{2\gamma  \cos \theta }{\rho \text{gr}}. $$
</div>

If we look at the different factors in this expression, we might see how it
makes good sense. The height is directly proportional to the surface tension
$$\gamma $$ , which is its direct cause. Furthermore, the height is inversely
proportional to tube radius—the smaller the radius $$r $$ , the higher the fluid
can be raised, since a smaller tube holds less mass. The height is also
inversely proportional to fluid density $$\rho $$ , since a larger density means
a greater mass in the same volume. (See [[Figure 9]](#Figure9).)

![The left image shows liquid in a container with four tubes of progressively smaller diameter inserted into the liquid. The liquid rises higher in the smaller-diameter tubes. The right image shows two containers, one holding a dense liquid and the other holding a less-dense liquid. Identical tubes are inserted into each liquid. The less-dense liquid rises higher in its tube than the more-dense liquid does in its tube.](../resources/Figure_11_08_10.jpg "(a) Capillary action depends on the radius of a tube. The smaller the tube, the greater the height reached. The height is negligible for large-radius tubes.

Calculating Radius of a Capillary Tube: Capillary Action: Tree Sap
</div>
Can capillary action be solely responsible for sap rising in trees? To answer this question, calculate the radius of a capillary tube that would raise sap 100 m to the top of a giant redwood, assuming that sap’s density is  $$1050 \text{kg}{\text{/m}}^{3} $$ ,
 its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is the same as that of water at  $$20.0º C $$.

**Strategy**

The height to which a liquid will rise as a result of capillary action is given
by $$h=\frac{2\gamma \cos \theta }{\rho \text{gr}} $$ , and every quantity is
known except for $$r $$.

**Solution**

Solving for $$r $$ and substituting known values produces

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}r& =& \frac{2\gamma  \cos \theta }{\rho gh}=\frac{2\left(0.0728 \text{N/m}\right)\cos\left(0º\right)}{\left(1050 {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\left(100 \text{m}\right)}\\ & =&  1.41 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This result is unreasonable. Sap in trees moves through the *xylem*, which forms
tubes with radii as small as $$ 2.5 \times 10^{-5} \text{m} $$ . This value is
about 180 times as large as the radius found necessary here to raise sap $$100
\text{m} $$ . This means that capillary action alone cannot be solely
responsible for sap getting to the tops of trees.

</div>

How *does* sap get to the tops of tall trees? (Recall that a column of water can
only rise to a height of 10 m when there is a vacuum at the
top—see [[Example 3]](../contents/ch11VariationOfPressure#Example3).) The question has not
been completely resolved, but it appears that it is pulled up like a chain held
together by cohesive forces. As each molecule of sap enters a leaf and
evaporates (a process called transpiration), the entire chain is pulled up a
notch. So a negative pressure created by water evaporation must be present to
pull the sap up through the xylem vessels. In most situations, *fluids can push
but can exert only negligible pull*, because the cohesive forces seem to be too
small to hold the molecules tightly together. But in this case, the cohesive
force of water molecules provides a very strong pull. [[Figure 10]](#Figure10)
shows one device for studying negative pressure. Some experiments have
demonstrated that negative pressures sufficient to pull sap to the tops of the
tallest trees *can* be achieved.

![When the piston is raised the liquid stretches somewhat, which results in negative pressure.](../resources/Figure_11_08_11.jpg "(a) When the piston is raised, it stretches the liquid slightly, putting it under tension and creating a negative absolute pressure \( P= -F/A \) . (b) The liquid eventually separates, giving an experimental limit to negative pressure in this liquid.")

### Section Summary

* Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive
  forces.
* Attractive forces between molecules of different types are called adhesive
  forces.
* Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to
  the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface
  tension.
* Capillary action is the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a
  narrow tube, or capillary tube which is due to the relative strength of
  cohesive and adhesive forces.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The density of oil is less than that of water, yet a loaded oil tanker sits lower in the water than an empty one. Why?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This question requires us to consider Archimedes' principle and distinguish between the density of the cargo and the total weight of the loaded ship.

**Solution**

The key to understanding this apparent paradox is recognizing that it is the *total weight* of the tanker (ship + cargo) that determines how deep it sits in the water, not the density of the cargo. According to Archimedes' principle, a floating object displaces a weight of water equal to its own weight. When the tanker is loaded with oil, even though the oil is less dense than water, the total weight of the ship plus oil is much greater than the weight of the empty ship alone. This greater total weight requires displacing more water to achieve buoyancy equilibrium, causing the loaded tanker to sit lower in the water.

**Discussion**

This situation illustrates that buoyancy depends on total weight, not on density comparisons between cargo and the surrounding fluid. Even if the tanker were loaded with something less dense than air, like helium-filled containers, the added mass would still cause the ship to sit lower. The comparison of oil's density to water's density is irrelevant—what matters is that adding any cargo increases the total weight that must be supported by buoyancy.

Surface tension is due to **cohesive forces** only. Surface tension arises from the attractive forces between molecules of the same type (liquid molecules attracting other liquid molecules). At the surface of a liquid, molecules experience a net inward pull because they have fewer neighboring liquid molecules above them than beside or below them. This imbalance creates a "skin" effect that minimizes the surface area. Adhesive forces, which act between different types of molecules (such as liquid and container), do not contribute to surface tension itself.

**Discussion**

While adhesive forces are important in related phenomena like capillary action and contact angle formation, surface tension is purely a cohesive phenomenon. This is why surface tension is a property of the liquid itself (independent of what it contacts) and why all liquids exhibit surface tension to some degree based on the strength of intermolecular attractions within that liquid.

Is capillary action due to cohesive or adhesive forces, or both?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to analyze the mechanism of capillary action and identify which molecular forces are involved.

**Solution**

Capillary action is due to **both** cohesive and adhesive forces. Adhesive forces between the liquid and the tube wall cause the liquid to "climb" up the walls of a narrow tube. Meanwhile, cohesive forces between liquid molecules pull the rest of the liquid along with the molecules that are adhering to the wall. The interplay of these two forces determines the behavior: if adhesive forces dominate (as with water in glass), the liquid rises and forms a concave meniscus; if cohesive forces dominate (as with mercury in glass), the liquid is depressed and forms a convex meniscus.

**Discussion**

The contact angle directly reflects the balance between cohesive and adhesive forces. A contact angle less than 90° (like water-glass at 0°) indicates that adhesive forces dominate, while a contact angle greater than 90° (like mercury-glass at 140°) indicates that cohesive forces dominate. Both types of forces must be present for capillary action to occur—without adhesion, there would be no "grip" on the wall, and without cohesion, the liquid would not move as a column.

Birds such as ducks, geese, and swans have greater densities than water, yet they are able to sit on its surface. Explain this ability, noting that water does not wet their feathers and that they cannot sit on soapy water.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to analyze how surface tension supports these birds and explain why their water-repellent feathers are essential for this phenomenon.

**Solution**

Waterfowl can sit on water because their oily, water-repellent feathers allow surface tension to support their weight. Because water does not wet their feathers (the feathers are hydrophobic), the water surface curves around the bird without breaking through. This curved water surface creates an upward component of the surface tension force that helps support the bird's weight. The bird essentially sits in a depression on the water surface, much like a water strider walks on water or a needle floats on a water surface.

When soap is added to the water, the surface tension is significantly reduced (from about 0.073 N/m to about 0.037 N/m). This lower surface tension cannot provide sufficient upward force to support the bird's weight, causing the bird to sink into the water. Additionally, soap may allow the water to penetrate the feathers, eliminating the hydrophobic barrier.

**Discussion**

This explains why waterfowl spend considerable time preening and spreading oil from their preen gland over their feathers—maintaining water-repellent feathers is essential for buoyancy and insulation. Oil spills are devastating to waterfowl precisely because petroleum products destroy this water-repellent coating, causing birds to become waterlogged and lose the surface tension support they depend on.

Water beads up on an oily sunbather, but not on her neighbor, whose skin is not oiled. Explain in terms of cohesive and adhesive forces.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to compare the relative strengths of cohesive forces within water and adhesive forces between water and the two different surfaces (oily skin versus bare skin).

**Solution**

Water beads up on the oily sunbather because the adhesive forces between water and oil are much weaker than the cohesive forces within water itself. With weak adhesion, water molecules are pulled together by their strong cohesive attractions, forming spherical droplets that minimize surface area. The contact angle between water and oily surfaces is large (greater than 90°), causing the water to form distinct beads.

On the non-oiled skin, the adhesive forces between water and skin are strong—comparable to or greater than the cohesive forces within water. These strong adhesive forces cause the water to spread out and flatten against the skin surface. The contact angle is small, and the water "wets" the skin rather than beading up.

**Discussion**

This is why oil and wax are used as water-repellent coatings on surfaces like cars, raincoats, and waterproof fabrics. By creating a surface with weak adhesion to water, these coatings ensure that water beads up and rolls off rather than spreading and soaking in. Conversely, surfactants (soaps and detergents) work by reducing water's surface tension and increasing its adhesion to surfaces, helping water spread and wet surfaces more effectively for cleaning.

Could capillary action be used to move fluids in a "weightless" environment, such as in an orbiting space probe?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to analyze whether capillary action depends on gravity and whether it would function in microgravity conditions.

**Solution**

Yes, capillary action could be used to move fluids in a weightless environment, and in fact, it would work even better than on Earth. Capillary action arises from the interplay of adhesive forces (between liquid and tube wall) and cohesive forces (within the liquid), and these molecular forces do not depend on gravity. On Earth, capillary rise is limited by the weight of the liquid column that must be supported. In microgravity, this weight limitation is essentially eliminated, so the liquid could travel much farther through capillary tubes.

**Discussion**

This principle is actually used in spacecraft fluid management systems. In microgravity, liquids behave unpredictably because they are not constrained by weight to stay at the "bottom" of containers. Surface tension and capillary action become dominant effects. Spacecraft fuel tanks use special screens and channels that exploit capillary action to ensure fuel flows to the pump inlets regardless of the spacecraft's orientation. Similarly, capillary-driven systems are used for moving other fluids in space, such as in life support systems and scientific experiments.

What effect does capillary action have on the reading of a manometer with uniform diameter? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to consider how capillary action affects liquid height in manometer tubes and whether this introduces systematic errors in pressure measurements.

**Solution**

In a manometer with uniform diameter, capillary action has **no effect** on the pressure reading. Although capillary action raises (or lowers) the liquid level in each arm of the manometer, the effect is identical in both arms since they have the same diameter and are made of the same material. The pressure measurement depends on the *difference* in liquid heights between the two arms, not the absolute heights. Since capillary action raises both columns by the same amount, this effect cancels out when taking the difference.

**Discussion**

This is why it is important for manometer tubes to have uniform diameter throughout. If the two arms had different diameters, the capillary rise would be different in each arm (smaller diameter = greater rise for liquids like water), introducing a systematic error in the pressure reading. For precise measurements, especially with small pressure differences, it is essential to use manometers with uniform, relatively large-diameter tubes to minimize the absolute capillary effect, even though it cancels in uniform tubes. Mercury manometers are less affected by capillary issues because mercury's large contact angle (140°) with glass causes depression rather than rise, and its high surface tension makes the effect more predictable.

Pressure between the inside chest wall and the outside of the lungs normally remains negative. Explain how pressure inside the lungs can become positive (to cause exhalation) without muscle action.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to consider the role of surface tension in the alveoli and how it can drive exhalation passively.

**Solution**

The pressure inside the lungs can become positive during exhalation without muscle action due to **surface tension** in the alveoli. The alveoli are small, spherical sacs lined with a thin layer of fluid. According to the pressure equation for a spherical bubble, $$ P = \frac{4\gamma}{r} $$, the pressure inside these fluid-lined sacs is greater than the pressure outside due to surface tension. This surface tension creates an inward force that tends to collapse the alveoli, generating positive pressure inside the lungs that pushes air out.

When the diaphragm and chest muscles relax after inhalation, the elastic recoil of the stretched lung tissue combined with the surface tension in the alveoli creates sufficient pressure to drive exhalation passively. This is why patients on positive-pressure ventilators can exhale on their own even if their respiratory muscles are paralyzed—the surface tension provides the driving force.

**Discussion**

The lung surfactant plays a critical role in modulating this effect. Without surfactant, the surface tension would be too high, making it difficult to inhale (the alveoli would resist expansion) and causing smaller alveoli to collapse into larger ones. The surfactant reduces surface tension, especially at smaller radii during exhalation, preventing alveolar collapse while still allowing passive exhalation. Premature infants lacking sufficient surfactant suffer from hyaline membrane disease precisely because this delicate balance is disrupted.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We can use the pressure equation for a spherical bubble, $$ P = \frac{4\gamma}{r} $$, and solve for surface tension $$\gamma$$. Then we can compare the result to values in Table 1 to identify the fluid.

**Solution**

(a) Solving the bubble pressure equation for surface tension:

$$ \gamma = \frac{Pr}{4} $$

Substituting the given values:

$$ \gamma = \frac{(1.40 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa})(2.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m})}{4} = \frac{0.280 \text{ N/m}}{4} = 0.0700 \text{ N/m} $$

(b) Comparing this value to Table 1, we find that $$\gamma = 0.0700 \text{ N/m}$$ is very close to the surface tension of water at 20°C (0.0728 N/m) and blood plasma at 37°C (0.073 N/m).

The surface tension of the fluid lining the alveolus is **0.0700 N/m**, and the fluid is most likely **blood plasma** or a similar tissue fluid, which is reasonable given that alveoli are surrounded by capillaries and lined with fluid similar in composition to blood plasma.

**Discussion**

This result is physiologically reasonable. The alveoli are lined with a thin layer of fluid that has properties similar to blood plasma. However, in healthy lungs, surfactant reduces this surface tension significantly (especially during exhalation) to prevent alveolar collapse. The value calculated here represents a condition without significant surfactant effect, which might occur in certain disease states or in premature infants lacking surfactant.

Calculate the force on the slide wire in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) if it is 3.50 cm long and the fluid is ethyl alcohol.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The sliding wire device has a liquid film attached to both sides of the wire. The force exerted by surface tension is $$F = \gamma L$$, where $$L$$ is the total length of the liquid-wire contact. Since the film has two surfaces (front and back), the effective length is $$L = 2l$$ where $$l$$ is the wire length.

**Solution**

From Table 1, the surface tension of ethyl alcohol is $$\gamma = 0.0223 \text{ N/m}$$.

The wire length is $$l = 3.50 \text{ cm} = 0.0350 \text{ m}$$.

Since the film has two surfaces attached to the wire, the total contact length is:

$$ L = 2l = 2(0.0350 \text{ m}) = 0.0700 \text{ m} $$

The force on the wire is:

$$ F = \gamma L = (0.0223 \text{ N/m})(0.0700 \text{ m}) = 1.56 \times 10^{-3} \text{ N} $$

The force on the slide wire is **1.56 × 10⁻³ N** (or 1.56 mN).

**Discussion**

This force is quite small (about 1.56 millinewtons), which is typical for surface tension effects. The force would be larger for a liquid with higher surface tension (like water at 0.0728 N/m, which would give about 5.10 mN) or smaller for liquids with lower surface tension. This demonstrates why surface tension effects are most noticeable at small scales where other forces (like weight) are also small.

 for it, making the same assumptions that sap's density is  $$1050 {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ ,
 its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is the same as that of water at  $$20.0º C $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the capillary rise equation $$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} $$ with the given values for xylem tubes carrying tree sap.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Radius: $$ r = 2.50 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m} $$
- Density of sap: $$ \rho = 1050 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
- Contact angle: $$ \theta = 0° $$ (so $$ \cos\theta = 1 $$)
- Surface tension (water at 20°C): $$ \gamma = 0.0728 \text{ N/m} $$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$ g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2 $$

Substituting into the capillary rise equation:

$$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} = \frac{2(0.0728 \text{ N/m})(1)}{(1050 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(2.50 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m})} $$

$$ h = \frac{0.1456 \text{ N/m}}{0.2573 \text{ N/m}^2} = 0.566 \text{ m} $$

The capillary rise in a xylem tube is approximately **0.57 m**, which is indeed less than 1 meter.

**Discussion**

This confirms that capillary action alone cannot raise sap to the top of tall trees—a giant redwood at 100 m would require capillary rise about 180 times greater than what xylem tubes can provide. The actual mechanism involves transpiration (water evaporating from leaves) creating negative pressure that pulls the sap column upward, with cohesive forces between water molecules keeping the column intact. This "cohesion-tension" mechanism allows sap to reach heights far beyond what capillary action alone could achieve.

If the gauge pressure inside a rubber balloon with a 10.0-cm radius is 1.50 cm of water, what is the effective surface tension of the balloon?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We treat the balloon as analogous to a bubble and use the pressure equation $$ P = \frac{4\gamma}{r} $$. First, we must convert the pressure from cm of water to Pascals.

**Solution**

First, convert the gauge pressure from cm of water to Pascals. Using $$ P = \rho g h $$ for water:

$$ P = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.0150 \text{ m}) = 147 \text{ Pa} $$

Now solve the bubble pressure equation for surface tension:

$$ \gamma = \frac{Pr}{4} $$

With radius $$ r = 10.0 \text{ cm} = 0.100 \text{ m} $$:

$$ \gamma = \frac{(147 \text{ Pa})(0.100 \text{ m})}{4} = \frac{14.7 \text{ N/m}}{4} = 3.68 \text{ N/m} $$

The effective surface tension of the rubber balloon is approximately **3.7 N/m**.

**Discussion**

This "surface tension" is much larger than typical liquid surface tensions (which are on the order of 0.01-0.1 N/m). This is because we are not measuring an actual surface tension but rather the effective elastic tension in the rubber membrane, which must stretch to contain the pressurized air. The rubber's elastic properties create a restoring force similar to surface tension in liquids, but much stronger. This is why blowing up a balloon requires more effort at the start (when the radius is small and the rubber is being stretched for the first time) but becomes easier as the balloon expands.

Suppose water is raised by capillary action to a height of 5.00 cm in a glass tube. (a) To what height will it be raised in a paraffin tube of the same radius? (b) In a silver tube of the same radius?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From the capillary rise equation $$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} $$, we see that for the same liquid (same $$\gamma$$, $$\rho$$) in tubes of the same radius, the height is proportional to $$\cos\theta$$. We can use the ratio of heights: $$ \frac{h_2}{h_1} = \frac{\cos\theta_2}{\cos\theta_1} $$.

**Solution**

For water in a glass tube with $$\theta_{\text{glass}} = 0°$$, so $$\cos(0°) = 1$$.

From Table 2:
- Water-paraffin contact angle: $$\theta_{\text{paraffin}} = 107°$$
- Water-silver contact angle: $$\theta_{\text{silver}} = 90°$$

(a) For the paraffin tube:

$$ h_{\text{paraffin}} = h_{\text{glass}} \times \frac{\cos\theta_{\text{paraffin}}}{\cos\theta_{\text{glass}}} = (5.00 \text{ cm}) \times \frac{\cos(107°)}{\cos(0°)} $$

$$ h_{\text{paraffin}} = (5.00 \text{ cm}) \times \frac{-0.292}{1} = -1.46 \text{ cm} $$

(b) For the silver tube:

$$ h_{\text{silver}} = h_{\text{glass}} \times \frac{\cos\theta_{\text{silver}}}{\cos\theta_{\text{glass}}} = (5.00 \text{ cm}) \times \frac{\cos(90°)}{\cos(0°)} $$

$$ h_{\text{silver}} = (5.00 \text{ cm}) \times \frac{0}{1} = 0 \text{ cm} $$

In a paraffin tube, water would be **depressed by 1.46 cm** (negative height indicates suppression). In a silver tube, water would experience **no capillary rise or depression** (h = 0).

**Discussion**

These results reflect the different relative strengths of adhesive versus cohesive forces. In paraffin (a waxy, hydrophobic material), the contact angle exceeds 90°, meaning cohesive forces in water dominate over adhesive forces to paraffin, causing the water to be pushed down. Silver presents an intermediate case where the contact angle is exactly 90°, meaning adhesive and cohesive forces are balanced, resulting in no net capillary effect. Glass, being hydrophilic, has strong adhesion to water, giving a 0° contact angle and maximum capillary rise.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the bubble pressure equation $$ P = \frac{4\gamma}{r} $$ for parts (a) and (b). For part (c), we need to find the final radius by conserving the total amount of air (moles of gas), then calculate the new pressure.

**Solution**

From Table 1, the surface tension of soapy water is $$\gamma = 0.0370 \text{ N/m}$$.

(a) For the small bubble with $$r_1 = 1.50 \text{ cm} = 0.0150 \text{ m}$$:

$$ P_1 = \frac{4\gamma}{r_1} = \frac{4(0.0370 \text{ N/m})}{0.0150 \text{ m}} = 9.87 \text{ Pa} $$

(b) For the large bubble with $$r_2 = 4.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0400 \text{ m}$$:

$$ P_2 = \frac{4\gamma}{r_2} = \frac{4(0.0370 \text{ N/m})}{0.0400 \text{ m}} = 3.70 \text{ Pa} $$

(c) To find the final bubble, we use conservation of air molecules. Assuming isothermal conditions (constant temperature) and that the gauge pressures are small compared to atmospheric pressure, the total volume of air is approximately conserved:

$$ V_1 + V_2 = V_f $$

$$ \frac{4}{3}\pi r_1^3 + \frac{4}{3}\pi r_2^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi r_f^3 $$

$$ r_f^3 = r_1^3 + r_2^3 = (0.0150)^3 + (0.0400)^3 = 3.375 \times 10^{-6} + 6.40 \times 10^{-5} $$

$$ r_f^3 = 6.74 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^3 $$

$$ r_f = 0.0407 \text{ m} = 4.07 \text{ cm} $$

The final pressure is:

$$ P_f = \frac{4\gamma}{r_f} = \frac{4(0.0370 \text{ N/m})}{0.0407 \text{ m}} = 3.64 \text{ Pa} $$

The gauge pressures are: (a) **9.87 Pa** for the 1.50-cm bubble, (b) **3.70 Pa** for the 4.00-cm bubble, and (c) **3.64 Pa** for the combined bubble with radius 4.07 cm.

**Discussion**

Notice that the smaller bubble has higher pressure (9.87 Pa vs 3.70 Pa), which explains why air flows from the smaller bubble to the larger one when they connect. The final pressure (3.64 Pa) is even lower than the original large bubble's pressure because the combined volume creates a still larger bubble. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between bubble radius and pressure, which also explains why it's harder to start blowing up a balloon (small radius, high pressure required) than to continue inflating it.

What is the ratio of heights to which ethyl alcohol and water are raised by capillary action in the same glass tube?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From the capillary rise equation $$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} $$, for two different liquids in the same tube (same $$r$$, same $$g$$), we can find the ratio of heights as:

$$ \frac{h_{\text{alcohol}}}{h_{\text{water}}} = \frac{\gamma_{\text{alcohol}} \cos\theta_{\text{alcohol}}}{\gamma_{\text{water}} \cos\theta_{\text{water}}} \times \frac{\rho_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{alcohol}}} $$

**Solution**

From Table 1 and Table 2:
- Surface tension of ethyl alcohol: $$\gamma_{\text{alcohol}} = 0.0223 \text{ N/m}$$
- Surface tension of water at 20°C: $$\gamma_{\text{water}} = 0.0728 \text{ N/m}$$
- Contact angle of ethyl alcohol with glass: $$\theta_{\text{alcohol}} = 0°$$
- Contact angle of water with glass: $$\theta_{\text{water}} = 0°$$

For densities (standard values):
- Density of ethyl alcohol: $$\rho_{\text{alcohol}} = 790 \text{ kg/m}^3$$
- Density of water: $$\rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3$$

Since both contact angles are 0°, $$\cos(0°) = 1$$ for both:

$$ \frac{h_{\text{alcohol}}}{h_{\text{water}}} = \frac{\gamma_{\text{alcohol}}}{\gamma_{\text{water}}} \times \frac{\rho_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{alcohol}}} $$

$$ \frac{h_{\text{alcohol}}}{h_{\text{water}}} = \frac{0.0223 \text{ N/m}}{0.0728 \text{ N/m}} \times \frac{1000 \text{ kg/m}^3}{790 \text{ kg/m}^3} $$

$$ \frac{h_{\text{alcohol}}}{h_{\text{water}}} = 0.306 \times 1.27 = 0.388 $$

The ratio of capillary rise heights is approximately **0.39** (or ethyl alcohol rises to about 39% of the height that water does in the same tube).

**Discussion**

Although ethyl alcohol has lower density than water (which would tend to increase its capillary rise), its surface tension is much lower (about 31% that of water). The net effect is that alcohol rises to less than half the height of water. This demonstrates that surface tension is the dominant factor in determining capillary rise height when contact angles are the same. The lower surface tension of alcohol is why it spreads more readily and "wets" surfaces more easily than water does.
