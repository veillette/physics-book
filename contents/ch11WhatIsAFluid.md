Matter most commonly exists as a solid, liquid, or gas; these states are known
as the three common *phases of matter*. Solids have a definite shape and a
specific volume, liquids have a definite volume but their shape changes
depending on the container in which they are held, and gases have neither a
definite shape nor a specific volume as their molecules move to fill the
container in which they are held. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) Liquids and
gases are considered to be fluids because they yield to shearing forces, whereas
solids resist them. Note that the extent to which fluids yield to shearing
forces (and hence flow easily and quickly) depends on a quantity called the
viscosity which is discussed in detail
in [Viscosity and Laminar Flow; Poiseuille’s Law](../contents/ch12ViscosityAndLaminarFlow).
We can understand the phases of matter and what constitutes a fluid by
considering the forces between atoms that make up matter in the three phases.

Atoms in *solids* are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the
atoms to vibrate but not to change positions with neighboring atoms. (These
forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed, but not
easily broken.) Thus, a solid *resists* all types of stress. A solid cannot be
easily deformed because the atoms that make up the solid are not able to move
about freely. Solids also resist compression, because their atoms form part of a
lattice structure in which the atoms are a relatively fixed distance apart.
Under compression, the atoms would be forced into one another. Most of the
examples we have studied so far have involved solid objects which deform very
little when stressed.

Connections: Submicroscopic Explanation of Solids and Liquids
</div>
Atomic and molecular characteristics explain and underlie the macroscopic characteristics of solids and fluids. This submicroscopic explanation is one theme of this text and is highlighted in the Things Great and Small features in [Conservation of Momentum](./ch8ConservationOfMomentum). See, for example, microscopic description of collisions and momentum or microscopic description of pressure in a gas. This present section is devoted entirely to the submicroscopic explanation of solids and liquids.

</div>

In contrast, *liquids* deform easily when stressed and do not spring back to
their original shape once the force is removed because the atoms are free to
slide about and change neighbors—that is, they *flow* (so they are a type of
fluid), with the molecules held together by their mutual attraction. When a
liquid is placed in a container with no lid on, it remains in the container (
providing the container has no holes below the surface of the liquid!). Because
the atoms are closely packed, liquids, like solids, resist compression.

Atoms in *gases* are separated by distances that are large compared with the
size of the atoms. The forces between gas atoms are therefore very weak, except
when the atoms collide with one another. Gases thus not only flow (and are
therefore considered to be fluids) but they are relatively easy to compress
because there is much space and little force between atoms. When placed in an
open container gases, unlike liquids, will escape. The major distinction is that
gases are easily compressed, whereas liquids are not. We shall generally refer
to both gases and liquids simply as **fluids**, and make a distinction between
them only when they behave differently.

### Section Summary

* A fluid is a state of matter that yields to sideways or shearing forces.
  Liquids and gases are both fluids. Fluid statics is the physics of stationary
  fluids.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What physical characteristic distinguishes a fluid from a solid?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
To distinguish fluids from solids, we must consider how each state of matter responds to applied forces, specifically shearing (sideways) forces.

**Solution:**
The key physical characteristic that distinguishes a fluid from a solid is that **a fluid yields to and flows under shearing forces, while a solid resists and maintains its shape**.

At the molecular level, this difference arises from the bonding between atoms:
- In solids, atoms are held in fixed positions by strong interatomic forces (like springs connecting neighboring atoms). When a shearing force is applied, the atoms may deform slightly but return to their original positions.
- In fluids (both liquids and gases), atoms or molecules can move past one another when a shearing force is applied. The atoms are not locked into fixed positions relative to their neighbors.

**Discussion:**
This distinction explains everyday observations: a block of ice maintains its shape under its own weight, but water takes the shape of its container. Similarly, honey flows slowly when tilted because it yields to shearing forces (though its high viscosity means it flows slowly). The ability to flow is the defining characteristic of fluids, which is why both liquids and gases are classified as fluids despite their other differences.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Which of the following substances are fluids at room temperature: air, mercury, water, glass?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
To identify fluids, we apply the defining characteristic: fluids are substances that yield to shearing forces and flow. We evaluate each substance at room temperature (approximately 20°C to 25°C).

**Solution:**
At room temperature, **air, mercury, and water are fluids**, while **glass is a solid**.

Analysis of each substance:
- **Air** is a gas composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen molecules. Gases are fluids because their molecules move freely and the substance flows readily to fill any container.
- **Mercury** is a liquid metal at room temperature (melting point: −39°C). It flows and takes the shape of its container, clearly demonstrating fluid behavior.
- **Water** is a liquid at room temperature (melting point: 0°C, boiling point: 100°C). It readily flows and conforms to container shapes.
- **Glass** is an amorphous solid at room temperature. While glass has a disordered molecular structure (unlike crystalline solids), it does not flow under normal conditions and maintains its shape indefinitely.

**Discussion:**
A common misconception is that glass is a "very slow-flowing liquid" based on observations of old window panes being thicker at the bottom. However, this thickness variation is due to historical manufacturing processes, not flow. Glass at room temperature is many orders of magnitude more viscous than any practical fluid—it would take longer than the age of the universe for glass to noticeably flow at room temperature. Therefore, glass is properly classified as a solid.

Why are gases easier to compress than liquids and solids?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
To understand compressibility differences, we must examine the molecular structure and spacing in each phase of matter.

**Solution:**
**Gases are easier to compress than liquids and solids because gas molecules are separated by large distances compared to their size, with mostly empty space between them.**

The molecular explanation:
- **In gases**, molecules are typically separated by distances 10 times or more larger than the molecules themselves. When pressure is applied, molecules simply move closer together into the available empty space. Little force is required because the molecules are not in contact.
- **In liquids**, molecules are nearly in contact with each other, with very little space between them. Compression requires forcing molecules closer together against strong repulsive forces that arise when electron clouds begin to overlap.
- **In solids**, atoms are locked in a lattice structure at essentially their minimum separation distance. Compressing a solid requires pushing atoms even closer against extremely strong electromagnetic repulsion.

**Discussion:**
This explains practical applications: air in a bicycle tire compresses easily when pumped, allowing more air molecules to fit in the same volume. Water in a hydraulic system, however, transmits pressure almost instantaneously because it barely compresses—this incompressibility is essential for hydraulic brakes and lifts. At standard temperature and pressure, air is about 20,000 times more compressible than water. The compressibility of gases also explains why scuba tanks can hold large volumes of breathing gas and why compressed natural gas vehicles store fuel at high pressures.

How do gases differ from liquids?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Both gases and liquids are fluids (they flow under shearing forces), so we need to identify the key properties that distinguish them from each other.

**Solution:**
While both gases and liquids are fluids, they differ in several important ways:

| Property | Liquids | Gases |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Compressibility** | Nearly incompressible | Highly compressible |
| **Molecular spacing** | Molecules nearly in contact | Molecules widely separated |
| **Definite volume** | Yes—maintains volume | No—expands to fill container |
| **Intermolecular forces** | Strong attractive forces | Weak forces (except during collisions) |
| **Density** | High (similar to solids) | Low (typically 1000× less than liquids) |
| **Container requirement** | Stays in open container | Must be in closed container |

**Discussion:**
These differences arise from molecular behavior:
- **Liquids** have molecules close enough that attractive forces (van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds) hold them together, giving liquids a definite volume. Water stays in an open glass because molecular attraction prevents molecules from escaping (except slowly through evaporation).
- **Gases** have molecules so far apart that attractive forces are negligible except during brief collisions. Gas molecules move freely at high speeds (hundreds of m/s at room temperature) and will escape any open container.

The high compressibility of gases versus the near-incompressibility of liquids is the most practically important distinction, enabling applications like pneumatic tools (which use compressible air) versus hydraulic systems (which use incompressible liquids for precise force transmission).
