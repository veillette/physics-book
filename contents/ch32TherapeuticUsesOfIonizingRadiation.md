* Explain the concept of radiotherapy and list typical doses for cancer therapy.
</div>

Therapeutic applications of ionizing radiation, called radiation therapy or **radiotherapy**, have existed since the discovery of X-rays and nuclear
radioactivity. Today, radiotherapy is used almost exclusively for cancer
therapy, where it saves thousands of lives and improves the quality of life and
longevity of many it cannot save. Radiotherapy may be used alone or in
combination with surgery and chemotherapy (drug treatment) depending on the type
of cancer and the response of the patient. A careful examination of all
available data has established that radiotherapy’s beneficial effects far
outweigh its long-term risks.

### Medical Application

The earliest uses of ionizing radiation on humans were mostly harmful, with many
at the level of snake oil as seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Radium-doped
cosmetics that glowed in the dark were used around the time of World War I. As
recently as the 1950s, radon mine tours were promoted as healthful and
rejuvenating—those who toured were exposed but gained no benefits. Radium salts
were sold as health elixirs for many years. The gruesome death of a wealthy
industrialist, who became psychologically addicted to the brew, alerted the
unsuspecting to the dangers of radium salt elixirs. Most abuses finally ended
after the legislation in the 1950s.

Until 1932, radium was advertised for a variety of uses, often with tragic results. (credit: Struthious Bandersnatch.)')

Radiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly
and, consequently, are more sensitive to radiation. The central problem in
radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while
limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal
cells killed is called the **therapeutic ratio**, and all radiotherapy
techniques are designed to enhance this ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in
cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques
for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)
. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of
directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. This concentrates the dose
in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue. The
external radiation can be X-rays, $${}^{60}\text{Co }\gamma $$ rays, or
ionizing-particle beams produced by accelerators. Accelerator-produced beams of
neutrons, $$\text{π-mesons} $$ , and heavy ions such as nitrogen nuclei have
been employed, and these can be quite effective. These particles have larger QFs
or RBEs and sometimes can be better localized, producing a greater therapeutic
ratio. But accelerator radiotherapy is much more expensive and less frequently
employed than other forms.

![The image shows a man lying on a flat surface. A gamma ray machine is rotated around the man.](../resources/Figure_32_03_02.jpg 'The 60Co source of ( \\gamma );-radiation is rotated around the patient so that the common crossing point is in the tumor, concentrating the dose there. This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors.')
{: #Figure2}

Another form of radiotherapy uses chemically inert radioactive implants. One use
is for prostate cancer. Radioactive seeds (about 40 to 100 and the size of a
grain of rice) are placed in the prostate region. The isotopes used are usually
$${}^{135}\text{I} $$
(6-month half life) or $${}^{103}\text{Pd} $$
(3-month half life). Alpha emitters have the dual advantages of a large QF and a
small range for better localization.

Radiopharmaceuticals are used for cancer therapy when they can be localized well
enough to produce a favorable therapeutic ratio. Thyroid cancer is commonly
treated utilizing radioactive iodine. Thyroid cells concentrate iodine, and
cancerous thyroid cells are more aggressive in doing this. An ingenious use of
radiopharmaceuticals in cancer therapy tags antibodies with radioisotopes.
Antibodies produced by a patient to combat his cancer are extracted, cultured,
loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are
concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus
localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. The therapeutic ratio can be quite
high for short-range radiation. There is, however, a significant dose for organs
that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys,
and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the
tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists typical therapeutic doses of radiation used against
certain cancers. The doses are large, but not fatal because they are localized
and spread out in time. Protocols for treatment vary with the type of cancer and
the condition and response of the patient. Three to five 200-rem treatments per
week for a period of several weeks is typical. Time between treatments allows
the body to repair normal tissue. This effect occurs because damage is
concentrated in the abnormal tissue, and the abnormal tissue is more sensitive
to radiation. Damage to normal tissue limits the doses. You will note that the
greatest doses are given to any tissue that is not rapidly reproducing, such as
in the adult brain. Lung cancer, on the other end of the scale, cannot
ordinarily be cured with radiation because of the sensitivity of lung tissue and
blood to radiation. But radiotherapy for lung cancer does alleviate symptoms and
prolong life and is therefore justified in some cases.

Finally, it is interesting to note that chemotherapy employs drugs that
interfere with cell division and is, thus, also effective against cancer. It
also has almost the same side effects, such as nausea and hair loss, and risks,
such as the inducement of another cancer.

### Section Summary

- Radiotherapy is the use of ionizing radiation to treat ailments, now limited
  to cancer therapy.
- The sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation enhances the ratio of cancer
  cells killed to normal cells killed, which is called the therapeutic ratio.
- Doses for various organs are limited by the tolerance of normal tissue for
  radiation. Treatment is localized in one region of the body and spread out in
  time.

(a) If the average molecular mass of compounds in food is 50.0 g, how many molecules are there in 1.00 kg of food? (b) How many ion pairs are created in 1.00 kg of food, if it is exposed to 1000 Sv and it takes 32.0 eV to create an ion pair? (c) Find the ratio of ion pairs to molecules. (d) If these ion pairs recombine into a distribution of 2000 new compounds, how many parts per billion is each?
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Find the number of moles in 1.00 kg, then multiply by Avogadro's number. (b) Convert the dose to energy deposited, then divide by the energy per ion pair. (c) Divide the results from (b) by (a). (d) Divide the total ion pairs by 2000 to find molecules per new compound type, then find the ratio to total molecules.

**Solution**

(a) Number of molecules in 1.00 kg of food:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{moles} = \frac{1000 \text{ g}}{50.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 20.0 \text{ mol} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N_{\text{molecules}} = (20.0 \text{ mol})(6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules/mol}) = 1.20 \times 10^{25} \text{ molecules} $$
</div>

(b) Number of ion pairs created:

First, find energy deposited. Since $$1 \text{ Sv} = 1 \text{ J/kg}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = (1000 \text{ Sv})(1.00 \text{ kg}) = 1000 \text{ J} $$
</div>

Convert to eV:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = 1000 \text{ J} \times \frac{1 \text{ eV}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}} = 6.24 \times 10^{21} \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Number of ion pairs:

<div class="equation">
$$ N_{\text{ion pairs}} = \frac{6.24 \times 10^{21} \text{ eV}}{32.0 \text{ eV/ion pair}} = 1.95 \times 10^{20} \text{ ion pairs} $$
</div>

(c) Ratio of ion pairs to molecules:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Ratio} = \frac{1.95 \times 10^{20}}{1.20 \times 10^{25}} = 1.63 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{1}{61,500} $$
</div>

This means about 1 molecule in every 61,500 is ionized.

(d) Parts per billion for each new compound:

If $$1.95 \times 10^{20}$$ ion pairs recombine into 2000 different new compounds:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Molecules per compound} = \frac{1.95 \times 10^{20}}{2000} = 9.75 \times 10^{16} \text{ molecules} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Parts per billion} = \frac{9.75 \times 10^{16}}{1.20 \times 10^{25}} \times 10^{9} = 8.1 \times 10^{0} \approx 8 \text{ ppb} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the chemical effects of food irradiation. Even at the massive dose of 1000 Sv (which would be instantly lethal to a human), only about 1 in 61,500 molecules is ionized. This relatively small fraction nevertheless creates $$1.95 \times 10^{20}$$ ion pairs, which can recombine to form new chemical compounds. If these reorganize into 2000 different new compounds (a reasonable estimate), each compound would be present at about 8 parts per billion. These trace amounts are generally considered safe and are similar to or less than concentrations of compounds formed during conventional food processing like cooking, canning, or freezing. The key safety consideration is whether any of these new compounds are harmful at such low concentrations. Extensive testing has shown that irradiated food is safe because: (1) the concentrations of radiolytic products are very low, (2) most such products are also formed during cooking, and (3) the compounds formed are generally simple and well-characterized. Food irradiation at much lower doses (typically 0.1-10 kGy or 0.1-10 Sv for RBE=1) is used to kill pathogens, extend shelf life, and control insects, making it a valuable food safety tool that has been approved by the FDA and WHO.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Calculate the number of decays in 32.0 s using the activity in Bq. Then find how many gamma rays are absorbed (1.00% strike × 20.0% absorbed = 0.200% total absorbed). Multiply by energy per gamma to get total energy absorbed, convert to joules, divide by tumor mass to get dose in Gy, then note that for gamma rays RBE = 1, so dose in rem equals dose in rad. (b) Compare with Table 1 therapeutic doses.

**Solution**

(a) Convert activity to Bq:

<div class="equation">
$$ R = 5000 \text{ Ci} \times \frac{3.70 \times 10^{10} \text{ Bq}}{1 \text{ Ci}} = 1.85 \times 10^{14} \text{ Bq} $$
</div>

Number of decays in 32.0 s:

<div class="equation">
$$ N_{\text{decays}} = (1.85 \times 10^{14} \text{ s}^{-1})(32.0 \text{ s}) = 5.92 \times 10^{15} \text{ decays} $$
</div>

Fraction absorbed in tumor:

<div class="equation">
$$ f = (0.0100)(0.200) = 0.00200 $$
</div>

Energy absorbed:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = (5.92 \times 10^{15})(0.00200)(1.25 \text{ MeV}) = 1.48 \times 10^{13} \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

Convert to joules:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = (1.48 \times 10^{13} \text{ MeV})(1.602 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV}) = 2.37 \text{ J} $$
</div>

Dose in Gy:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Dose in Gy} = \frac{2.37 \text{ J}}{1.50 \text{ kg}} = 1.58 \text{ Gy} = 158 \text{ rad} $$
</div>

Since RBE = 1 for gamma rays:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Dose in rem} = (158 \text{ rad})(1) = 158 \text{ rem} = 1.58 \text{ Sv} $$
</div>

(b) From Table 1, therapeutic doses range from 10-20 Sv for lung cancer up to 80+ Sv for brain, neck, bone, soft tissue, and thyroid cancers. A typical treatment protocol delivers about 2 Sv (200 rem) per session. Our calculated dose of 1.58 Sv (158 rem) is **consistent with a single therapeutic treatment**, slightly below the typical 200 rem per fraction. Multiple treatments would bring the total cumulative dose into the therapeutic range shown in Table 1.

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates a realistic cancer radiotherapy scenario. The 5000-Ci (185 TBq) $${}^{60}\text{Co}$$ source produces an enormous number of decays—nearly 6 quadrillion in just 32 seconds! However, careful collimation ensures that only 1% of the radiation strikes the patient, and only 20% of that is absorbed in the tumor, so that only 0.2% of the emitted radiation energy is actually deposited in the tumor. This geometric focusing, achieved by rotating the source around the patient as shown in Figure 2, is critical for delivering high doses to the tumor while minimizing exposure to healthy tissue. The dose of 158 rem to the tumor in a single 32-second exposure is substantial but safe when localized. This would typically be one of multiple fractionated treatments delivered over several weeks, with the tumor receiving total cumulative doses of 50-80 Sv or more depending on cancer type and location. The fact that no beta particles reach the patient is important because $${}^{60}\text{Co}$$ emits both beta particles and gamma rays; the betas are easily stopped by the source housing and collimator, while the 1.17 and 1.33 MeV gamma rays penetrate to reach the tumor. Modern linear accelerators have largely replaced $${}^{60}\text{Co}$$ units in developed countries, but cobalt-60 therapy remains important in developing nations due to its simplicity, reliability, and lower cost.

**Strategy**

Calculate the number of decays in one day from the activity, multiply by the energy per decay and the absorption fraction to get total energy deposited, convert to joules, and divide by body mass to get dose in Gy. Since gamma rays have RBE = 1, the dose in Sv equals the dose in Gy, then convert to mSv.

**Solution**

Convert activity to Bq:

<div class="equation">
$$ R = 50.0 \text{ μCi} = 50.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Ci} \times \frac{3.70 \times 10^{10} \text{ Bq}}{1 \text{ Ci}} = 1.85 \times 10^{6} \text{ Bq} $$
</div>

Number of decays in one day:

<div class="equation">

$$ \text{Dose in Gy} = \frac{5.64 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J}}{75.0 \text{ kg}} = 7.52 \times 10^{-5} \text{ Gy} $$

Since RBE = 1 for gamma rays:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Dose in Sv} = 7.52 \times 10^{-5} \text{ Sv} = 0.0752 \text{ mSv} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The dose of 0.075 mSv in one day is relatively small but not negligible. To put this in perspective, the average annual background radiation dose is about 3 mSv, so this one-day dose from ingested $${}^{65}\text{Zn}$$ represents about 2.5% of the annual background dose. However, this calculation only accounts for one day's exposure. The actual total dose depends on how long the zinc-65 remains in the body. With a radiological half-life of 244 days, $${}^{65}\text{Zn}$$ decays relatively slowly, but biological elimination removes zinc from the body with a biological half-life of about 300-500 days. The effective half-life (combining radioactive decay and biological elimination) is approximately 140 days. Over this longer period, the cumulative dose would be significantly higher—roughly 150 times the one-day dose, or about 11 mSv total. This cumulative dose is still well below occupational limits (20-50 mSv/y) but represents a serious contamination incident that would require medical follow-up and investigation. This problem underscores the importance of proper safety protocols when machining or handling materials that have been exposed to radiation. Even if the copper appears "cold" (low external radiation), internal contamination from ingested or inhaled particulates can deliver significant doses. The 40% absorption fraction is realistic for gamma rays from an internally distributed source, as some gammas escape the body without interacting.

(a) Work backwards from dose to find mass. For alpha particles, RBE = 20, so $$\text{dose in Sv} = \text{dose in Gy} \times 20$$. Convert dose to energy deposited per year, assuming 100% absorption since alphas have short range. Find number of decays per year, then use $$R = \frac{0.693N}{t_{1/2}}$$ to find N, and convert to mass. The half-life of $${}^{226}\text{Ra}$$ is 1600 years.

This is not surprising when we consider: (1) Alpha particles have very high RBE = 20, causing 20 times more biological damage per unit energy than gamma rays; (2) The 4.80 MeV energy per decay is substantial; (3) Alpha particles deposit all their energy within the body due to their short range; (4) The long half-life of 1600 years means the activity persists essentially unchanged over a human lifetime.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates why alpha emitters are particularly hazardous when ingested or inhaled. A mass of only 11.3 nanograms—invisible to the naked eye and containing only 30 trillion atoms—produces 412 decays per second continuously over years. Because alpha particles have a range of only about 40 micrometers in tissue, they deposit all 4.80 MeV of energy locally, and their high ionization density (RBE = 20) makes them 20 times more damaging than gamma rays for the same energy deposition. The actual average background dose from $${}^{226}\text{Ra}$$ is only 0.01 mSv/y, which would correspond to a body burden of only 0.045 ng—an incredibly tiny amount. The elevated dose of 2.50 mSv/y in this problem could occur in regions with high natural radium in soil and groundwater, such as certain areas with granite geology. Radium is chemically similar to calcium and concentrates in bones when ingested, where its alpha emissions can damage bone marrow and potentially cause bone cancer or leukemia. This is what tragically occurred to the "Radium Girls" who painted watch dials with radium-containing luminous paint in the 1920s and ingested radium by licking their brushes. Their cases led to improved occupational safety standards and our modern understanding of internal alpha emitter hazards.

If everyone in Australia received an extra 0.05 mSv per year of radiation, what would be the increase in the number of cancer deaths per year? (Assume that time had elapsed for the effects to become apparent.) Assume that there are  $$200 \times 10^{-4}  $$
 deaths per Sv of radiation per year. What percent of the actual number of cancer deaths recorded is this?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Multiply Australia's population by the dose to get total person-Sv, then multiply by the death rate per Sv. Compare this to the natural cancer death rate. Australia's population is approximately 26 million (as of 2025). The natural cancer death rate is about 20% of all deaths over a lifetime, which translates to roughly 200,000 cancer deaths per million people over 70 years, or about 2850 cancer deaths per million people per year.

**Solution**

Total collective dose for Australia:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Collective dose} = (26 \times 10^{6} \text{ people})(0.05 \text{ mSv}) = 1.3 \times 10^{6} \text{ mSv} = 1300 \text{ person-Sv} $$
</div>

Increase in cancer deaths per year using the given rate of $$200 \times 10^{-4} = 0.0200$$ deaths per Sv per year:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta \text{deaths} = (1300 \text{ person-Sv})(0.0200 \text{ deaths/Sv·y}) = 26 \text{ deaths/y} $$
</div>

Expected cancer deaths per year in Australia without additional radiation:

Australia has about 26 million people. With a crude cancer death rate of approximately 110 deaths per 100,000 people per year:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Natural cancer deaths} = (26 \times 10^{6})\left(\frac{110}{100,000}\right) \approx 28,600 \text{ deaths/y} $$
</div>

Percentage increase:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Percent increase} = \frac{26}{28,600} \times 100\% = 0.091\% \approx 0.09\% $$
</div>

**Discussion**

An additional 26 cancer deaths per year from an extra 0.05 mSv annual dose across Australia's entire population would represent only about 0.09% of the natural cancer death rate. This increase would be completely undetectable statistically, lost in the natural variations in cancer rates that occur from year to year and region to region. This calculation demonstrates several important points about low-dose radiation risk: (1) Even a population-wide exposure produces effects that are statistically invisible against the natural cancer rate; (2) The linear hypothesis predicts that collective doses matter—26 million people each receiving a tiny dose has the same predicted effect as 26 people each receiving a large dose; (3) Individual risk remains very small—each person's additional risk is only $$0.05 \text{ mSv} \times 0.0200 \text{ deaths/Sv} = 10^{-6}$$ or one in a million. This level of dose and risk is comparable to natural variations in background radiation between locations (for example, moving from sea level to a mile-high city increases annual dose by about 0.5 mSv). The inability to detect such small increases in cancer rates is one reason why the health effects of low-dose radiation remain controversial—we must rely on extrapolation from high-dose data using the linear hypothesis, which may overestimate risks at very low doses. Nevertheless, radiation protection standards use this conservative approach to minimize all unnecessary exposures following the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable).
