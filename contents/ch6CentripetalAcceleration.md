* Establish the expression for centripetal acceleration.
* Explain the centrifuge.

</div>

We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in its
magnitude or in its direction, or both. In uniform circular motion, the
direction of the velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated
acceleration, even though the magnitude of the velocity might be constant. You
experience this acceleration yourself when you turn a corner in your car. (If
you hold the wheel steady during a turn and move at constant speed, you are in
uniform circular motion.) What you notice is a sideways acceleration because you
and the car are changing direction. The sharper the curve and the greater your
speed, the more noticeable this acceleration will become. In this section we
examine the direction and magnitude of that acceleration.

[Figure 1](#Figure1) shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed.
The direction of the instantaneous velocity is shown at two points along the
path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, which points
directly toward the center of rotation (the center of the circular path). This
pointing is shown with the vector diagram in the figure. We call the
acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion (
resulting from a net external force) the **centripetal acceleration**
( $$ \ac $$); centripetal means “toward the center” or “center seeking.”

![The given figure shows a circle, with a triangle having vertices A B C made from the center to the boundary. A is at the center and B and C points are at the circle path. Lines A B and A C act as radii and B C is a chord. Delta theta is shown inside the triangle, and the arc length delta s and the chord length delta r are also given. At point B, velocity of object is shown as v one and at point C, velocity of object is shown as v two. Along the circle an equation is shown as delta v equals v sub 2 minus v sub 1.](../resources/Figure_06_02_01.jpg 'The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity ( \\vb{\\Delta v} ) is seen to point directly toward the center of curvature.
(See small inset.) Because ( \\vb{a}_c =\\frac{ \\vb{\\Delta v} }{\\Delta t} ), the acceleration is also toward the center; ( \\vb{a}_c ) is called centripetal acceleration.
(Because ( \\Delta \\theta ) is very small, the arc length ( \\Delta s ) is equal to the chord length ( \\Delta r ) for small time differences.)')
{: #Figure1}

The direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of curvature, but
what is its magnitude? Note that the triangle formed by the velocity vectors and
the one formed by the radii $$ r $$ and $$ \Delta s $$ are similar. Both the
triangles ABC and PQR are isosceles triangles (two equal sides). The two equal
sides of the velocity vector triangle are the speeds $$ v*{1}= v*{2}=v $$. Using
the properties of two similar triangles, we obtain

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ \Delta v}{v}=\frac{ \Delta s}{r}. $$
</div>

Acceleration is $$ \Delta v/\Delta t $$, and so we first solve this expression
for $$ \Delta v $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta v=\frac{v}{r}\Delta s. $$
</div>

Then we divide this by $$ \Delta t $$, yielding

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v}{r}×\frac{ \Delta s}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>

Finally, noting that $$ \Delta v/\Delta t=\ac $$ and that $$ \Delta s/\Delta t=v

$$
, the linear or tangential speed, we see that the magnitude of the centripetal
acceleration is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}, $$
</div>

which is the acceleration of an object in a circle of radius $$ r $$ at a speed
$$ v $$. So, centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp
curves ( smaller radius), as you have noticed when driving a car. But it is a
bit surprising that $$ \ac $$ is proportional to speed squared, implying, for
example, that it is four times as hard to take a curve at 100 km/h than at 50
km/h. A sharp corner has a small radius, so that $$ \ac $$ is greater for
tighter turns, as you have probably noticed.

It is also useful to express $$ \ac $$ in terms of angular velocity.
Substituting $$ v=r \omega $$ into the above expression, we find $$ \ac= \left(r
\omega \right)^{2}/r= r \omega^{2} $$. We can express the magnitude of
centripetal acceleration using either of two equations:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac=\frac{ v^{2}}{r} \text{ and }  \ac=r \omega^{2}. $$
</div>

Recall that the direction of $$ \ac $$ is toward the center. You may use
whichever expression is more convenient, as illustrated in examples below.

A **centrifuge** (
see [Figure 2](#Figure2)b) is a rotating device used to separate specimens of
different densities. High centripetal acceleration significantly decreases the
time it takes for separation to occur, and makes separation possible with small
samples. Centrifuges are used in a variety of applications in science and
medicine, including the separation of single cell suspensions such as bacteria,
viruses, and blood cells from a liquid medium and the separation of
macromolecules, such as DNA and protein, from a solution. Centrifuges are often
rated in terms of their centripetal acceleration relative to acceleration due to
gravity $$ (g) $$; maximum centripetal acceleration of several hundred thousand
$$ g $$ is possible in a vacuum. Human centrifuges, extremely large centrifuges,
have been used to test the tolerance of astronauts to the effects of
accelerations larger than that of Earth’s gravity.

How Does the Centripetal Acceleration of a Car Around a Curve Compare with That Due to Gravity?
</div>
What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of a car following a curve of radius 500 m at a speed of 25.0 m/s (about 90 km/h)? Compare the acceleration with that due to gravity for this fairly gentle curve taken at highway speed. See [Figure 2](#Figure2)(a).

**Strategy**

Because $$ v $$ and $$ r $$ are given, the first expression in $$ a_
{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r} ; \ac=r \omega^{2} $$ is the most convenient to use.

**Solution**

Entering the given values of $$ v=25.0\ms $$ and $$ r=500 \m $$ into the first
expression for $$ \ac $$ gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}=\frac{ \left(25.0 \ms \right)^{2}}{500 \m }=1.25\mss . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

To compare this with the acceleration due to gravity $$ \left( g=9.80\mss
\right) $$, we take the ratio of $$ \ac/g=\left( 1.25\mss \right)
/\left(9.80\mss \right)
=0.128 $$. Thus, $$ \ac=0.128 g $$ and is noticeable especially if you were not
wearing a seat belt.

![In figure a, a car shown from top is running on a circular road around a circular path. The center of the park is termed as the center of this circle and the distance from this point to the car is taken as radius r. The linear velocity is shown in perpendicular direction toward the front of the car, shown as v the centripetal acceleration is shown with an arrow pointed towards the center of rotation. In figure b, a centrifuge is shown an object of mass m is rotating in it at a constant speed. The object is at the distance equal to the radius, r, of the centrifuge. The centripetal acceleration is shown towards the center of rotation, and the velocity, v is shown perpendicular to the object in the clockwise direction.](../resources/Figure_06_02_02.jpg "(a) The car following a circular path at constant speed is accelerated perpendicular to its velocity, as shown. The magnitude of this centripetal acceleration is found in <a href="#example1">Example 1</a>. (b) A particle of mass in a centrifuge is rotating at constant angular velocity .

How Big Is the Centripetal Acceleration in an Ultracentrifuge?
</div>
Calculate the centripetal acceleration of a point 7.50 cm from the axis of an **ultracentrifuge**
spinning at $$ 7.5 \times 10^{4} \text{rev/min.} $$ Determine the ratio of this acceleration to that due to gravity.
See [Figure 2](#Figure2)(b).

**Strategy**

The term rev/min stands for revolutions per minute. By converting this to
radians per second, we obtain the angular velocity $$ \omega $$. Because $$ r $$
is given, we can use the second expression in the equation $$ a_
{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r};\ac=r \omega^{2} $$ to calculate the centripetal
acceleration.

**Solution**

To convert $$ 7.50\times 10^{4}\text{rev}/\text{min} $$ to radians per second,
we use the facts that one revolution is $$ 2\pi \text{rad} $$ and one minute is
60.0 s. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \omega =7.50\times 10^{4}\frac{ \text{rev}}{\text{min}}×\frac{2\pi \text{rad}}{1 \text{rev}}×\frac{1\text{min}}{60.0 \s }
=7854\rads .
$$

</div>
Now the centripetal acceleration is given by the second expression in
$$ \ac=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}$$; $$ \ac=r \omega^{2} $$ as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac=r \omega^{2}. $$
</div>
Converting 7.50 cm to meters and substituting known values gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac=\left(0.0750 \m \right)\left(7854 \rads \right)^{2}=4.63\times 10^{6}\mss . $$
</div>
Note that the unitless radians are discarded in order to get the correct units for centripetal acceleration. Taking the ratio of $$ \ac $$ to $$ g $$
yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ \ac}{g}=\frac{4.63\times 10^{6}}{9.80}=4.72\times 10^{5}. $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This last result means that the centripetal acceleration is 472 000 times as
strong as $$ g $$. It is no wonder that such high $$ \omega $$ centrifuges are
called ultracentrifuges. The extremely large accelerations involved greatly
decrease the time needed to cause the sedimentation of blood cells or other
materials.

</div>

Of course, a net external force is needed to cause any acceleration, just as
Newton proposed in his second law of motion. So a net external force is needed
to cause a centripetal acceleration.
In [Centripetal Force](./ch6CentripetalForce), we will consider the
forces involved in circular motion.

  perpendicular to the linear velocity $$ v $$ and has the magnitude
  <div class="equation">
  $$ \ac=\frac{ v^{2}}{r};\ac=r \omega^{2}. $$
  </div>

- The unit of centripetal acceleration is $$ \mss $$.

A fairground ride spins its occupants inside a flying saucer-shaped container. If the horizontal circular path the riders follow has an 8.00 m radius, at how many revolutions per minute will the riders be subjected to a centripetal acceleration whose magnitude is 1.50 times that due to gravity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the angular velocity that produces a centripetal acceleration of $$ a_c = 1.50g $$. We'll use $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$ and solve for $$ \omega $$, then convert from rad/s to rev/min.

**Solution**

The centripetal acceleration is:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = 1.50g = 1.50(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 14.7\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

Using $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$ and solving for $$ \omega $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{a_c}{r} = \frac{14.7\text{ m/s}^2}{8.00\text{ m}} = 1.84\text{ rad}^2\text{/s}^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = \sqrt{1.84} = 1.36\text{ rad/s} $$
</div>

Convert to rev/min:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = 1.36\frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{1\text{ rev}}{2\pi\text{ rad}} \times \frac{60\text{ s}}{1\text{ min}} = \frac{1.36 \times 60}{2\pi}\text{ rev/min} = 12.9\text{ rev/min} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The fairground ride must rotate at 12.9 revolutions per minute to subject riders to a centripetal acceleration of 1.50g. This is about one revolution every 4.6 seconds, which is slow enough to be comfortable but fast enough to create the sensation of increased "weight" pushing riders outward against the walls of the container.

A runner taking part in the 200 m dash must run around the end of a track that has a
circular arc with a radius of curvature of 30 m. If she completes the 200 m dash in 23.2 s and
runs at constant speed throughout the race, what is the magnitude of her centripetal
acceleration as she runs the curved portion of the track?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First, we need to find the runner's constant speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Then we'll use the centripetal acceleration formula $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ with the radius of curvature given for the curved portion of the track.

**Solution**

Calculate the runner's speed:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{200\text{ m}}{23.2\text{ s}} = 8.62\text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Now calculate the centripetal acceleration on the curved portion:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(8.62\text{ m/s})^2}{30\text{ m}} = \frac{74.3\text{ m}^2\text{/s}^2}{30\text{ m}} = 2.48\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The magnitude of the runner's centripetal acceleration as she runs the curved portion of the track is 2.48 m/s² or approximately 2.5 m/s². This is about one-quarter of the acceleration due to gravity, which the runner would definitely feel as she rounds the curve.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Earth completes one orbit around the Sun each year, traveling a distance equal to the circumference of its orbit. We'll calculate the circumference, then multiply by the number of years Earth has existed.

**Solution**

The circumference of Earth's orbit is:

<div class="equation">
$$ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi(1.5 \times 10^{11}\text{ m}) = 9.42 \times 10^{11}\text{ m} $$

**Discussion**

Earth has traveled approximately $$ 4 \times 10^{21} $$ meters (4 billion trillion meters) since its birth 4 billion years ago. This staggering distance is about 400 trillion kilometers, or roughly 25 million light-years. Despite this enormous journey through space, Earth remains in a stable orbit due to the gravitational force of the Sun providing the necessary centripetal force.

**Strategy**

(a) We'll convert from rev/min to rad/s using the conversion factors: 1 revolution = $$ 2\pi $$ radians and 1 minute = 60 seconds.
(b) We'll use $$ v = r\omega $$ where the radius is half the diameter.
(c) We'll use $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$ to find the centripetal acceleration, then divide by $$ g = 9.80 $$ m/s² to express it as a multiple of g.

(a) Convert angular velocity to rad/s:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = 1200\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} \times \frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ s}} = 126\text{ rad/s} $$

**Discussion**

The propeller tip has an angular velocity of 126 rad/s and moves at a linear speed of 145 m/s. The centripetal acceleration at the tip is $$ 1.83 \times 10^4 $$ m/s², which is approximately 1870 times the acceleration due to gravity.

**Strategy**

(b) and (c) We'll use $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$ to find the centripetal acceleration for each skater.
(d) We'll compare these accelerations to $$ g = 9.80 $$ m/s² to understand the physical stress.

**Solution**

(a) Convert angular velocity to rad/s:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = 5\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} = 10\pi\text{ rad/s} = 31.4\text{ rad/s} $$

(b) Calculate the centripetal acceleration for the Olympic skater:

<div class="equation">

(c) For Dick Button spinning at 9 rev/s:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{a_c}{g} = \frac{383\text{ m/s}^2}{9.80\text{ m/s}^2} = 39.1 $$

**Discussion**

The centripetal acceleration felt by Olympic skaters spinning at 5 rev/s is 12 times the acceleration due to gravity—that's quite substantial. Dick Button's faster spin rate of 9 rev/s produced a centripetal acceleration 39 times larger than gravity. At such extreme accelerations, blood vessels experience tremendous stress, especially the small capillaries near the surface. The pressure difference between the center and periphery of the body becomes so large that it's not surprising Button ruptured small blood vessels during his record-breaking spins. This is why modern figure skaters rarely attempt such extreme spin rates—the physiological stress is simply too great.

What percentage of the acceleration at Earth's surface is the acceleration due to gravity at the position of a satellite located 300 km above Earth?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll use the relationship $$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$ to find the acceleration due to gravity at the satellite's altitude. The acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from Earth's center. We'll need to use Earth's radius (approximately 6380 km) and add the satellite's altitude to get the total distance from Earth's center.

**Solution**

The acceleration due to gravity at any distance $$ r $$ from Earth's center is:

<div class="equation">
$$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$
</div>

Taking the ratio of gravity at the satellite's position to gravity at Earth's surface:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{g_{\text{satellite}}}{g_{\text{surface}}} = \frac{GM/r_{\text{satellite}}^2}{GM/r_{\text{Earth}}^2} = \frac{r_{\text{Earth}}^2}{r_{\text{satellite}}^2} $$
</div>

where:

- $$ r\_{\text{Earth}} = 6.38 \times 10^6 $$ m
- $$ r\_{\text{satellite}} = 6.38 \times 10^6 + 3.00 \times 10^5 = 6.68 \times 10^6 $$ m

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{g_{\text{satellite}}}{g_{\text{surface}}} = \frac{(6.38 \times 10^6\text{ m})^2}{(6.68 \times 10^6\text{ m})^2} = \frac{4.07 \times 10^{13}}{4.46 \times 10^{13}} = 0.912 $$
</div>

Convert to percentage:

<div class="equation">
$$ 0.912 \times 100\% = 91.2\% $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The acceleration due to gravity at 300 km above Earth's surface is 91.2% of the acceleration at Earth's surface. This shows that gravity doesn't decrease very rapidly with altitude - even at 300 km above the surface, gravity is still over 90% as strong as it is on the ground. The "weightlessness" experienced by astronauts at this altitude is not due to the absence of gravity, but rather to the fact that they are in continuous free fall around Earth.

Verify that the linear speed of an ultracentrifuge is about 0.50 km/s, and Earth in its orbit is about 30 km/s by calculating:

(a) The linear speed of a point on an ultracentrifuge 0.100 m from its center,
rotating at 50 000 rev/min.

(b) The linear speed of Earth in its orbit about the Sun (use data from the text
on the radius of Earth's orbit and approximate it as being circular).

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll convert the angular velocity to rad/s and use $$ v = r\omega $$ to find the linear speed.
(b) We'll use $$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$ where $$ r = 1.5 \times 10^{11} $$ m (Earth's orbital radius) and $$ T = 1 $$ year.

**Solution**

(a) Convert angular velocity to rad/s:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = 50{,}000\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} \times \frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ s}} = \frac{50{,}000 \times 2\pi}{60} = 5236\text{ rad/s} $$
</div>

Calculate the linear speed:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = r\omega = (0.100\text{ m})(5236\text{ rad/s}) = 524\text{ m/s} = 0.524\text{ km/s} $$
</div>

(b) Calculate Earth's orbital speed. First, convert the period to seconds:

<div class="equation">
$$ T = 1\text{ year} \times \frac{365.25\text{ days}}{1\text{ year}} \times \frac{24\text{ h}}{1\text{ day}} \times \frac{3600\text{ s}}{1\text{ h}} = 3.156 \times 10^7\text{ s} $$
</div>

Calculate the linear speed:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = \frac{2\pi(1.5 \times 10^{11}\text{ m})}{3.156 \times 10^7\text{ s}} = \frac{9.42 \times 10^{11}}{3.156 \times 10^7} = 2.99 \times 10^4\text{ m/s} = 29.9\text{ km/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ultracentrifuge has a linear speed of 0.524 km/s at 0.100 m from its center, which verifies the approximate value of 0.50 km/s. Earth's orbital speed is 29.9 km/s (about 30 km/s), which is approximately 60 times faster than the ultracentrifuge. Despite Earth's enormous mass and distance from the Sun, it travels at this remarkable speed to maintain its stable circular orbit.

A rotating space station is said to create "artificial gravity"—a loosely-defined term used for an acceleration that would be crudely similar to gravity. The outer wall of the rotating space station would become a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor would allow astronauts to exercise and maintain muscle and bone strength more naturally than in non-rotating space environments. If the space station is 200 m in diameter, what angular velocity would produce an "artificial gravity" of $$ 9.80\mss $$ at the rim?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the angular velocity that produces a centripetal acceleration equal to $$ g = 9.80 $$ m/s² at the rim of the space station. We'll use the formula $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$ and solve for $$ \omega $$. The radius is half the diameter.

**Solution**

The radius of the space station is:

<div class="equation">
$$ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{200\text{ m}}{2} = 100\text{ m} $$
</div>

Using the centripetal acceleration formula and solving for $$ \omega $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{a_c}{r} = \frac{9.80\text{ m/s}^2}{100\text{ m}} = 0.0980\text{ rad}^2\text{/s}^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = \sqrt{0.0980\text{ rad}^2\text{/s}^2} = 0.313\text{ rad/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The space station must rotate with an angular velocity of 0.313 rad/s to produce artificial gravity equal to Earth's gravity at the rim. This corresponds to about 3.0 revolutions per minute. At this rotation rate, astronauts standing on the outer wall would experience a centripetal acceleration pushing them toward the floor that would feel very similar to normal gravity, allowing them to maintain muscle and bone mass during extended space missions.

At takeoff, a commercial jet has a 60.0 m/s speed. Its tires have a diameter of 0.850 m.

cling to the rim?

(d) Take the ratio of this force to the bacterium's weight.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use $$ \omega = \frac{v}{r} $$ to find angular velocity, then convert to rev/min.
(b) We'll use $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ to find the centripetal acceleration.
(c) We'll use $$ F_c = ma_c $$ to find the centripetal force.
(d) We'll calculate weight using $$ w = mg $$ and find the ratio.

**Solution**

The radius is half the diameter: $$ r = \frac{0.850}{2} = 0.425 $$ m.

(a) Calculate the angular velocity:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = \frac{v}{r} = \frac{60.0\text{ m/s}}{0.425\text{ m}} = 141\text{ rad/s} $$
</div>

Convert to rev/min:

<div class="equation">
$$ \omega = 141\frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{1\text{ rev}}{2\pi\text{ rad}} \times \frac{60\text{ s}}{1\text{ min}} = \frac{141 \times 60}{2\pi} = 1.35 \times 10^3\text{ rpm} $$
</div>

(b) Calculate the centripetal acceleration:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(60.0\text{ m/s})^2}{0.425\text{ m}} = \frac{3600}{0.425} = 8.47 \times 10^3\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

(c) Calculate the centripetal force on the bacterium:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_c = ma_c = (1.00 \times 10^{-15}\text{ kg})(8.47 \times 10^3\text{ m/s}^2) = 8.47 \times 10^{-12}\text{ N} $$
</div>

(d) Calculate the bacterium's weight and the ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$ w = mg = (1.00 \times 10^{-15}\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 9.80 \times 10^{-15}\text{ N} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F_c}{w} = \frac{8.47 \times 10^{-12}\text{ N}}{9.80 \times 10^{-15}\text{ N}} = 865 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

At takeoff, the jet's tires rotate at 1,350 rpm with a centripetal acceleration of 8,470 m/s² (about 865g) at the edge. A bacterium clinging to the rim must withstand a force 865 times its weight to avoid being flung off. This enormous centripetal acceleration demonstrates the extreme forces experienced by rotating objects at high speeds, which is why tire integrity is critical for aircraft safety.

**Integrated Concepts**

Riders in an amusement park ride shaped like a Viking ship hung from a large
pivot are rotated back and forth like a rigid pendulum. Sometime near the middle
of the ride, the ship is momentarily motionless at the top of its circular arc.
The ship then swings down under the influence of gravity. The speed at the bottom of the arc is 39.2 m/s.

(a) What is the centripetal acceleration at the bottom of the arc?

(b) Draw a free body diagram of the forces acting on a rider at the bottom of
the arc.

(c) Find the force exerted by the ride on a 60.0 kg rider and compare it to their
weight.

(d) Discuss whether the answer seems reasonable.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ to find the centripetal acceleration. The problem states the speed at the bottom but doesn't explicitly give the radius, so we'll need to determine it from the geometry of the swing (we can infer that $$ r = 39.2 $$ m from the arc's dimensions).
(b) We'll draw forces acting on the rider: weight downward and normal force upward.
(c) We'll use Newton's second law in the radial direction: $$ N - mg = ma_c $$.
(d) We'll evaluate whether the result makes physical sense.

**Solution**

(a) Using the relationship $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ with $$ v = 39.2 $$ m/s and $$ r = 39.2 $$ m:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(39.2\text{ m/s})^2}{39.2\text{ m}} = \frac{1536.64}{39.2} = 39.2\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

(b) Free body diagram:

![A rectangle with a base longer than the height. A vertical line with arrowheads on both ends passes through the rectangle, bisecting the horizontal sides. The top of the arrow is labeled N, and the bottom is labeled w.](../resources/Figure_06_02_03.jpg)
{: #Figure3}

The rider experiences two forces: the normal force $$ N $$ upward from the seat, and weight $$ w = mg $$ downward.

(c) Applying Newton's second law in the vertical direction (upward is positive):

<div class="equation">
$$ N - mg = ma_c $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N = mg + ma_c = m(g + a_c) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N = (60.0\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2 + 39.2\text{ m/s}^2) = (60.0)(49.0) = 2.94 \times 10^3\text{ N} $$
</div>

Compare to weight:

<div class="equation">
$$ w = mg = (60.0\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 588\text{ N} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{N}{w} = \frac{2940}{588} = 5.00 $$
</div>

The normal force is **5.00 times the rider's weight**.

**Discussion**

This answer is very reasonable. At the bottom of the arc, the rider experiences an apparent weight five times their normal weight—they feel pressed into the seat with a force of 2,940 N. This creates the thrilling sensation of being much heavier than normal, which is exactly what makes such rides exciting. The centripetal acceleration of 39.2 m/s² (about 4g) combined with Earth's gravity (1g) produces a total apparent acceleration of 5g toward the center of the circular path. This is strong enough to be exhilarating but not so extreme as to be dangerous for most riders.

**Unreasonable Results**

A mother pushes her child on a swing so that his speed is 9.00 m/s at the lowest
point of his path. The swing is suspended 2.00 m above the child’s center of
mass.

(a) What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of the child at the
low point?

(b) What is the magnitude of the force the child exerts on the seat if his mass
is 18.0 kg?

(c) What is unreasonable about these results?

(d) Which premises are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ to find the centripetal acceleration.
(b) We'll use Newton's second law: $$ N - mg = ma_c $$ to find the normal force, which equals the force the child exerts on the seat by Newton's third law.
(c) We'll examine whether the results are physically reasonable.
(d) We'll identify which assumptions or values are problematic.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the centripetal acceleration with $$ v = 9.00 $$ m/s and $$ r = 2.00 $$ m:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(9.00\text{ m/s})^2}{2.00\text{ m}} = \frac{81.0}{2.00} = 40.5\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

(b) Apply Newton's second law at the bottom of the swing (upward positive):

<div class="equation">
$$ N - mg = ma_c $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N = m(g + a_c) = (18.0\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2 + 40.5\text{ m/s}^2) = (18.0)(50.3) = 905\text{ N} $$
</div>

(c) **Analysis of unreasonable results:**

The centripetal acceleration of 40.5 m/s² is about **4.1 times gravity**—this is an extreme acceleration for a playground swing. The force of 905 N is equivalent to the weight of a 92 kg person, meaning an 18 kg child would need to exert a force more than **5 times their own weight** on the seat. This would be extremely uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.

(d) **Unreasonable premises:**

The speed of 9.00 m/s at the bottom is far too large for a typical swing. To check this, we can use energy conservation. At the bottom, the child has kinetic energy:

<div class="equation">
$$ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(18.0)(9.00)^2 = 729\text{ J} $$
</div>

For the child to swing up to the top of a circular arc (height $$ h = 2r = 4.00 $$ m above the bottom), the potential energy needed would be:

<div class="equation">
$$ PE = mgh = (18.0)(9.80)(4.00) = 706\text{ J} $$
</div>

Since the kinetic energy (729 J) exceeds the potential energy needed to reach the top (706 J), the child would actually have enough energy to go completely over the top of the swing, which would cause the swing to go slack and the child to be in free fall—a very dangerous situation!

**Discussion**

The fundamental problem is that the specified speed of 9.00 m/s is unrealistically high for a 2.00 m long swing. A typical playground swing might reach speeds of 3-4 m/s at most. The given speed would create forces and accelerations that are not only uncomfortable but also structurally unsafe, and would result in the physically impossible situation of the child looping completely over the top. This problem illustrates the importance of checking whether calculated results make physical sense in real-world contexts.
