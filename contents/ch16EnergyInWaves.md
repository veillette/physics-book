Rescue people are seen around.](../resources/Figure_16_11_01.jpg 'The destructive effect of an earthquake is palpable evidence of the energy carried in these waves.

{: #Figure1}

All waves carry energy. The energy of some waves can be directly observed.
Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of
thousands of wrecking balls.

Loud sounds pulverize nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing
loss. Ultrasound is used for deep-heat treatment of muscle strains. A laser beam
can burn away a malignancy. Water waves chew up beaches.

The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude
earthquakes produce large ground displacements. Loud sounds have higher pressure
amplitudes and come from larger-amplitude source vibrations than soft sounds.
Large ocean breakers churn up the shore more than small ones. More
quantitatively, a wave is a displacement that is resisted by a restoring force.
The larger the displacement $$x $$ , the larger the force $$F=kx $$ needed to
create it. Because work $$W $$ is related to force multiplied by distance (
$$ F x $$ )
and energy is put into the wave by the work done to create it, the energy in a
wave is related to amplitude. In fact, a wave’s energy is directly proportional
to its amplitude squared because

<div class="equation" >
 $$Wc\propto F x=kx^{2}\text{.} $$
</div>

The energy effects of a wave depend on time as well as amplitude. For example,
the longer deep-heat ultrasound is applied, the more energy it transfers. Waves
can also be concentrated or spread out. Sunlight, for example, can be focused to
burn wood. Earthquakes spread out, so they do less damage the farther they get
from the source. In both cases, changing the area the waves cover has important
effects. All these pertinent factors are included in the definition of **intensity** $$I $$ as power per unit area:

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{P}{A} $$
</div>

where $$P $$ is the power carried by the wave through area $$A $$ . The
definition of intensity is valid for any energy in transit, including that
carried by waves. The SI unit for intensity is watts per square meter ( $$
{\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ). For example, infrared and visible energy from the Sun
impinge on Earth at an intensity of $$1300 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ just above the
atmosphere. There are other intensity-related units in use, too. The most common
is the decibel. For example, a 90 decibel sound level corresponds to an
intensity of $$10^{-3} {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ .
This quantity is not much power per unit area considering that 90 decibels is a
relatively high sound level. Decibels will be discussed in some detail in a
later chapter.

<div class="title">
Calculating intensity and power: How much energy is in a ray of sunlight?
</div>
The average intensity of sunlight on Earth’s surface is about  $$700 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$.

(a) Calculate the amount of energy that falls on a solar collector having an
area of $$ 0.500 {\text{m}}^{2} $$ in $$ 4.00 \text{h} $$.

(b) What intensity would such sunlight have if concentrated by a magnifying
glass onto an area 200 times smaller than its own?

**Strategy a**

Because power is energy per unit time or $$P=\frac{E}{t} $$ , the definition of
intensity can be written as $$I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{E/t}{A} $$ , and this equation
can be solved for E with the given information.

**Solution a**

1. Begin with the equation that states the definition of intensity:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$I=\frac{P}{A}. $$
   </div>

2. Replace $$P $$ with its equivalent $$E/t $$  
   \:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$I=\frac{E/t}{A}. $$
   </div>

3. Solve for $$E $$  
   \:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$E= IAt. $$
   </div>

4. Substitute known values into the equation:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$E=\left(700 {\text{W/m}}^{2}\right)\left( 0.500 {\text{m}}^{2}\right)\left[ \left( 4.00 \text{h}\right)\left(3600 \text{s/h}\right)\right]  . $$
   </div>

5. Calculate to find $$E $$ and convert units:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$ 5.04 \times 10^{6}  \text{J}, $$
   </div>

**Discussion a**

The energy falling on the solar collector in 4 h in part is enough to be
useful—for example, for heating a significant amount of water.

**Strategy b**

Taking a ratio of new intensity to old intensity and using primes for the new
quantities, we will find that it depends on the ratio of the areas. All other
quantities will cancel.

**Solution b**

1. Take the ratio of intensities, which yields:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$\frac{I^{\prime}}{I}=\frac{P^{\prime}/A^{\prime}}{P/A}=\frac{A}{A^{\prime}} \left(\text{The powers cancel because} P^{\prime}=P\right)\text{.} $$
   </div>

2. Identify the knowns:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$A=200A^{\prime}, $$
   </div>

   <div class="equation" >
    $$\frac{I^{\prime}}{I}=200. $$
   </div>

3. Substitute known quantities:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$I^{\prime}=200I=200\left(700 {\text{W/m}}^{2}\right). $$
   </div>

4. Calculate to find $$I^{\prime} $$  
   \:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$I^{\prime}= 1.40 \times 10^{5}  {\text{W/m}}^{2}. $$
   </div>

**Discussion b**

Decreasing the area increases the intensity considerably. The intensity of the
concentrated sunlight could even start a fire.

Determine the combined intensity of two waves: Perfect constructive interference
</div>
If two identical waves, each having an intensity of  $$ 1.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ,
 interfere perfectly constructively, what is the intensity of the resulting wave?

**Strategy**

We know from [Superposition and Interference](../contents/ch16SuperpositionAndResonance)
that when two identical waves, which have equal amplitudes $$X $$ , interfere
perfectly constructively, the resulting wave has an amplitude of $$2X $$ .
Because a wave’s intensity is proportional to amplitude squared, the intensity
of the resulting wave is four times as great as in the individual waves.

**Solution**

1. Recall that intensity is proportional to amplitude squared.
2. Calculate the new amplitude:
   <div class="equation" >
   $$I^{\prime}\propto {\left(X^{\prime}\right)}^{2}={\left(2X\right)
   }^{2}={4X}^{2}. $$
   </div>

3. Recall that the intensity of the old amplitude was:
   <div class="equation" >
    $${I}^{}\propto {X}^{2}. $$
   </div>

4. Take the ratio of new intensity to the old intensity. This gives:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$\frac{I^{\prime}}{I}=4. $$
   </div>

5. Calculate to find $$I^{\prime} $$  
   \:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$I^{\prime}=4I= 4.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2}. $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

The intensity goes up by a factor of 4 when the amplitude doubles. This answer
is a little disquieting. The two individual waves each have intensities of $$
1.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ , yet their sum has an intensity of $$ 4.00
{\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ , which may appear to violate conservation of energy. This
violation, of course, cannot happen. What does happen is intriguing. The area
over which the intensity is $$ 4.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ is much less than the
area covered by the two waves before they interfered. There are other areas
where the intensity is zero. The addition of waves is not as simple as our first
look in [Superposition and Interference](../contents/ch16SuperpositionAndResonance)
suggested. We actually get a pattern of both constructive interference and
destructive interference whenever two waves are added. For example, if we have
two stereo speakers putting out $$ 1.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ each, there will be
places in the room where the intensity is $$ 4.00 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ , other
places where the intensity is zero, and others in
between. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows what this interference might look like. We
will pursue interference patterns elsewhere in this text.

The interference of the sound waves from these two speakers is shown. There are some red spots, showing constructive interference, are shown on the interfering waves. ](../resources/Figure_16_11_02.jpg 'These stereo speakers produce both constructive interference and destructive interference in the room, a property common to the superposition of all types of waves.

**Medical Application**

Ultrasound of intensity $$ 1.50 \times 10^{2} {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ is produced by
the rectangular head of a medical imaging device measuring 3.00 by 5.00 cm. What
is its power output?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Power is related to intensity by $$I = \frac{P}{A}$$, so $$P = IA$$. We need to calculate the area of the rectangular head and multiply by the intensity.

**Solution**

Convert dimensions to meters:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Width} = 3.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0300 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Length} = 5.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the area of the rectangular head:

<div class="equation">
 $$A = (0.0300)(0.0500) = 1.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

Calculate power output:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = IA = (1.50 \times 10^2)(1.50 \times 10^{-3})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0.225 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The power output of 0.225 W (or 225 mW) is typical for medical ultrasound imaging devices. While this seems like a small power, it produces a high intensity (150 W/m²) because the power is concentrated over a small area (15 cm²). Medical ultrasound uses frequencies in the MHz range, which penetrate tissue effectively while remaining safe for diagnostic imaging. The relatively low power prevents tissue heating, making ultrasound safe for frequent use and even for imaging during pregnancy. Therapeutic ultrasound for deep-heat treatment may use higher powers to deliberately heat tissue.

**Answer**

0.225 W

The low-frequency speaker of a stereo set has a surface area of  $$ 0.05 {\text{m}}^{2} $$
 and produces 1W of acoustical power. What is the intensity at the speaker? If the speaker projects sound uniformly in all directions, at what distance from the speaker is the intensity  $$ 0.1 {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For the first part, intensity is power per unit area. For the second part, if sound projects uniformly in all directions, the power spreads over a spherical surface of area $$4\pi r^2$$.

**Solution**

Intensity at the speaker surface:

<div class="equation">
 $$I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{1.0}{0.05} = 20 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

For uniform spherical radiation, at distance $$r$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
</div>

Solving for $$r$$ when $$I = 0.1 \text{ W/m}^2$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$r = \sqrt{\frac{P}{4\pi I}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.0}{4\pi(0.1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.0}{1.257}} = \sqrt{0.796} = 0.89 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The intensity at the speaker surface is 20 W/m², which is quite high for acoustic power. As the sound spreads out spherically, the intensity decreases with the square of the distance. At about 89 cm (less than 1 meter) from the speaker, the intensity has already dropped to 0.1 W/m², demonstrating how rapidly sound intensity diminishes with distance. This is why you need to be relatively close to speakers to hear them clearly.

**Answer**

Intensity at speaker: 20 W/m²

Distance for 0.1 W/m²: 0.89 m or 89 cm

To increase intensity of a wave by a factor of 50, by what factor should the amplitude be increased?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude: $$I \propto A^2$$. If we want to increase intensity by a factor of 50, we need to find the factor by which amplitude must increase.

**Solution**

Let the original amplitude be $$A_1$$ and the new amplitude be $$A_2$$. The relationship between intensity and amplitude gives:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{A_2^2}{A_1^2} = \left(\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right)^2$$
</div>

We want $$I_2 = 50I_1$$, so:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 50 = \left(\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right)^2$$
</div>

Taking the square root of both sides:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \times 2} = 5\sqrt{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 5(1.414) = 7.07$$
</div>

**Discussion**

To increase intensity by a factor of 50, the amplitude must increase by a factor of approximately 7.07, which is $$\sqrt{50}$$. This square-root relationship between amplitude and intensity is fundamental to wave physics and follows from the fact that wave energy (and thus intensity) depends on the square of the amplitude. This relationship holds for all types of waves—mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves, and sound waves. For example, to make a sound 50 times more intense, you would need to increase the pressure amplitude of the sound wave by a factor of 7.07, not 50. This is why small increases in amplitude can lead to large increases in perceived loudness or wave energy.

A device called an insolation meter is used to measure the intensity of sunlight

$${\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Intensity is power divided by area. We need to convert the area from cm² to m².

**Solution**

Convert area to m²:

<div class="equation">
 $$A = 100 \text{ cm}^2 = 100 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 0.0100 \text{ m}^2$$

Calculate intensity:

<div class="equation">
 $$I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{6.50}{0.0100} = 650 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The measured intensity of 650 W/m² is consistent with typical sunlight intensity on Earth's surface, which ranges from about 600-1000 W/m² depending on time of day, weather, and atmospheric conditions. This is less than the approximately 1300 W/m² that arrives at the top of the atmosphere because some solar energy is absorbed and scattered by the atmosphere. Insolation meters are important for evaluating solar panel locations and for meteorological measurements.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the relationship $$I = \frac{P}{A}$$ where power $$P = \frac{E}{t}$$. Combining these gives $$I = \frac{E}{At}$$, which we can solve for time $$t$$.

**Solution**

From $$I = \frac{E}{At}$$, we solve for $$t$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{E}{IA}$$

Substitute the known values:
- $$E = 1.8 \times 10^9$$ J
- $$I = 1.30$$ kW/m² = $$1.30 \times 10^3$$ W/m²
- $$A = 1.00$$ m²

<div class="equation">

**Discussion**

It takes 16 days for 1.8 billion joules of solar energy to arrive on a 1 m² area at the top of Earth's atmosphere. This calculation assumes continuous exposure at the given intensity, which represents the solar constant—the intensity of solar radiation at Earth's orbital distance from the Sun. In reality, factors like Earth's rotation (day/night cycles), atmospheric absorption, and cloud cover significantly reduce the actual energy reaching the ground. The large amount of energy (1.8 GJ) accumulated over 16 days demonstrates the vast energy potential of solar radiation, even over a small area. This is equivalent to the energy content of about 50 liters of gasoline, highlighting why solar energy is a promising renewable energy source.

Suppose you have a device that extracts energy from ocean breakers in direct proportion to their intensity. If the device produces 10.0 kW of power on a day when the breakers are 1.20 m high, how much will it produce when they are 0.600 m high?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The intensity of waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Since the device extracts power in direct proportion to intensity, and wave height is proportional to amplitude, the power is proportional to the square of the wave height.

**Solution**

The relationship between power and wave height is:

<div class="equation">
 $$P \propto I \propto A^2 \propto h^2$$
</div>

where $$h$$ is the wave height. Taking the ratio:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{h_2^2}{h_1^2} = \left(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\right)^2$$
</div>

Substitute the values:
- $$P_1 = 10.0$$ kW (when $$h_1 = 1.20$$ m)
- $$h_2 = 0.600$$ m

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{0.600}{1.20}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_2 = \frac{1}{4}P_1 = \frac{1}{4}(10.0) = 2.50 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

When the wave height is halved (from 1.20 m to 0.600 m), the power output drops to one-quarter of its original value (from 10.0 kW to 2.50 kW). This demonstrates the square relationship between wave amplitude and energy. Ocean wave energy devices face this challenge: their output is highly variable because it depends on the square of wave height. A calm day with half the normal wave height produces only 25% of the power of a stormy day. This variability is one of the engineering challenges in making wave energy economically viable, requiring either energy storage systems or integration with other power sources to provide consistent electricity to the grid.

**Strategy**

For part (a), the electrical power output equals the incident solar power times the efficiency. For part (b), we calculate the total energy produced over two years and multiply by the rate to find the revenue.

**Solution**

(a) The incident power on the array is $$P_{\text{incident}} = IA$$. The electrical power output is:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{out}} = \eta \times P_{\text{incident}} = \eta \times IA$$

(b) Energy produced per day:

An array area of 1.43 m² (about 1.2 m × 1.2 m) is quite modest and could fit on a small portion of a roof. However, the maximum cost of only $65.70 for a two-year payback is unrealistically low—actual solar panels cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. This problem illustrates why solar power has historically required subsidies or higher electricity rates to be economically viable. With typical electricity rates of 9 ¢/kWh, a small 100 W system would take many years to pay for itself. Higher electricity rates, government incentives, or longer amortization periods make solar more economically attractive.

A microphone receiving a pure sound tone feeds an oscilloscope, producing a wave on its screen. If the sound intensity is originally  $$2.00 \times 10^{-5} {\text{W/m}}^{2}, $$
 but is turned up until the amplitude increases by 30.0%, what is the new intensity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Since intensity is proportional to the square of amplitude ($$I \propto A^2$$), when the amplitude increases by 30.0% (factor of 1.30), the intensity increases by a factor of $$(1.30)^2$$.

**Solution**

The new amplitude is:

<div class="equation">
 $$A_2 = 1.30 A_1$$
</div>

The intensity is proportional to amplitude squared:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \left(\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right)^2 = (1.30)^2 = 1.69$$

<div class="equation">
 $$I_2 = 3.38 \times 10^{-5} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**Discussion**

When the amplitude increases by 30%, the intensity increases by 69% (from $$2.00 \times 10^{-5}$$ W/m² to $$3.38 \times 10^{-5}$$ W/m²). This is because intensity depends on the square of amplitude. The original intensity corresponds to a fairly quiet sound (about 43 decibels above the threshold of hearing), and the new intensity is moderately louder but still well within safe listening levels. This quadratic relationship means that doubling the amplitude would quadruple the intensity—a significant increase in sound energy. In practical terms, when you turn up the volume on audio equipment and increase the amplitude by 30%, the power consumption and sound intensity increase by 69%, not just 30%.

 $$E_{\text{incident}} = \frac{E_{\text{absorbed}}}{0.90} = \frac{500}{0.90} = 556 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Power of the laser beam:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{E_{\text{incident}}}{t} = \frac{556}{4.00} = 139 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Area of the circular spot (diameter = 2.00 mm = 0.00200 m):

<div class="equation">
 $$A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.00100)^2 = 3.14 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

Intensity:

<div class="equation">
 $$I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{139}{3.14 \times 10^{-6}} = 4.43 \times 10^7 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

(b) **Discussion**: This intensity is approximately:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{4.43 \times 10^7}{700} = 6.3 \times 10^4 \text{ times more intense than sunlight!}$$
</div>

This is about 63,000 times more intense than sunlight. If such a laser beam entered your eye, it would cause immediate and severe damage to the retina, potentially leading to instant and permanent blindness. Even a brief exposure (fraction of a second) could cause irreversible damage because:

1. The eye's lens focuses light onto a tiny spot on the retina, further concentrating the intensity
2. The retina has no pain receptors, so damage occurs before you can react
3. The extreme intensity can burn tissue almost instantaneously

This illustrates why medical lasers require extreme safety precautions, protective eyewear, and trained operators. The high intensity needed for surgical applications makes these lasers extremely dangerous if misused.

**Answer**

(a) $$4.43 \times 10^7 \text{ W/m}^2$$ or 44.3 MW/m²

(b) This is approximately 63,000 times more intense than sunlight and would cause immediate, permanent eye damage if the beam entered the eye.
