Physical characteristics that are quantized—such as energy, charge, and angular
momentum—are of such importance that names and symbols are given to them. The
values of quantized entities are expressed in terms of **quantum numbers**, and
the rules governing them are of the utmost importance in determining what nature
is and does. This section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and
rules—all of which apply in chemistry, material science, and far beyond the
realm of atomic physics, where they were first discovered. Once again, we see
how physics makes discoveries which enable other fields to grow.

The _energy states of bound systems are quantized_, because the particle
wavelength can fit into the bounds of the system in only certain ways. This was
elaborated for the hydrogen atom, for which the allowed energies are expressed
as $${E}_{n}\propto 1/{n}^{2} $$ , where $$n=1, 2, 3, ... $$ . We define $$n $$
to be the principal quantum number that labels the basic states of a system. The
lowest-energy state has $$n=1 $$ , the first excited state has $$n=2 $$ , and so
on. Thus the allowed values for the principal quantum number are

<div class="equation" >
 $$n=1, 2, 3, .... $$
</div>

This is more than just a numbering scheme, since the energy of the system, such
as the hydrogen atom, can be expressed as some function of $$n $$ , as can other
characteristics (such as the orbital radii of the hydrogen atom).

The fact that the _magnitude of angular momentum is quantized_ was first
recognized by Bohr in relation to the hydrogen atom; it is now known to be true
in general. With the development of quantum mechanics, it was found that the
magnitude of angular momentum $$L $$ can have only the values

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left(l=0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$l $$ is defined to be the **angular momentum quantum number**. The rule
for $$l $$ in atoms is given in the parentheses. Given $$n $$ , the value of $$l $$ can be any integer from zero up to $$n-1 $$ . For example, if $$n=4 $$ , then
$$l $$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Note that for $$n=1 $$ , $$l $$ can only be zero. This means that the
ground-state angular momentum for hydrogen is actually zero, not $$h/2\pi $$ as
Bohr proposed. The picture of circular orbits is not valid, because there would
be angular momentum for any circular orbit. A more valid picture is the cloud of
probability shown for the ground state of hydrogen
in [[Figure 3]](../contents/ch30TheWaveNatureOfMatterCausesQuantization#Figure3). The electron actually spends time in
and near the nucleus. The reason the electron does not remain in the nucleus is
related to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle—the electron’s energy would have
to be much too large to be confined to the small space of the nucleus. Now the
first excited state of hydrogen has $$n=2 $$ , so that $$l $$ can be either 0 or
1, according to the rule in $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ .
Similarly, for $$n=3 $$ , $$l $$ can be 0, 1, or 2. It is often most convenient
to state the value of $$l $$ , a simple integer, rather than calculating the
value of $$L $$ from $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ . For
example, for $$l=2 $$ , we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\sqrt{2\left(2+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi }=\sqrt{6}\frac{h}{2\pi }= 0.390h= 2.58 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J}\cdot s. $$
</div>

It is much simpler to state $$l=2 $$.

As recognized in the Zeeman effect, the _direction of angular momentum is
quantized_. We now know this is true in all circumstances. It is found that the
component of angular momentum along one direction in space, usually called the
$$z $$ -axis, can have only certain values of $${L}_{z} $$ . The direction in
space must be related to something physical, such as the direction of the
magnetic field at that location. This is an aspect of relativity. Direction has
no meaning if there is nothing that varies with direction, as does magnetic
force. The allowed values of $${L}_{z} $$ are

<div class="equation" >
 $${L}_{z}={m}_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left( {m}_{l}=-l,-l+1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ... l-1, l\right) \text{,} $$
</div>

where $${L}_{z} $$ is the  $$z $$-**component of the angular momentum** and
$${m}_{l} $$ is the angular momentum projection quantum number. The rule in
parentheses for the values of $${m}_{l} $$ is that it can range from $$-l $$ to
$$l $$ in steps of one. For example, if $$l=2 $$ , then $${m}_{l} $$ can have
the five values –2, –1, 0, 1, and 2. Each $${m}_{l} $$ corresponds to a
different energy in the presence of a magnetic field, so that they are related
to the splitting of spectral lines into discrete parts, as discussed in the
preceding section. If the $$z $$ -component of angular momentum can have only
certain values, then the angular momentum can have only certain directions, as
illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

![The image shows two possible values of component of a given angular momentum along z-axis. One circular orbit above the original circular orbit is shown for m sub l value of plus one. Another circular orbit below the original circular orbit is shown for m sub l value of minus one. The angular momentum vector for the top circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub one with the vertical axis. The horizontal angular momentum vector at original circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub two with the vertical axis. The angular momentum vector for the bottom circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub three with the vertical axis.](../resources/Figure_30_08_01.jpg 'The component of a given angular momentum along the z-axis (defined by the direction of a magnetic field) can have only certain values; these are shown here for l=1, for which ( m_\\text{l}=-1, 0, \\text{ and } +1 ) . The direction of L is quantized in the sense that it can have only certain angles relative to the z-axis.')

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
What Are the Allowed Directions?
</div>
Calculate the angles that the angular momentum vector  $$\vb{L} $$
  can make with the  $$z $$
-axis for  $$l=1 $$ ,
 as illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

**Strategy**

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) represents the vectors $$\vb{L} $$ and
$${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ as usual, with arrows proportional to their
magnitudes and pointing in the correct directions. $$\vb{L} $$ and
$${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ form a right triangle, with $$\vb{L} $$ being
the hypotenuse and $${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ the adjacent side. This means
that the ratio of $${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ to $$\vb{L} $$ is the cosine of the
angle of interest. We can find $$\vb{L} $$ and $${\vb{L}}_ {z} $$ using $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ and $${L}_ {z}=m\frac{h}{2\pi } $$. 

**Solution**

We are given $$l=1 $$ , so that $${m}_{l} $$ can be +1, 0, or −1. Thus $$L $$
has the value given by $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}h}{2\pi }=\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi } $$
</div>
 $$L_{z} $$ can have three values, given by  $$L_{z}= m_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$.

<div class="equation" >
$$ L_{z}=m_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi }=\left\{ $$
\begin{array}{cccc} \frac{h}{2\pi },&  {m}_{l}& =& +1 \\ 
0, & {m}_{l}& =& 0 \\ 
-\frac{h}{2\pi },&  {m}_{l}& =& -1
\end{array}
\right\} $$ $$
</div>
As can be seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1),  $$\cos \theta =\frac{ L_{z} }{L} , $$
 and so for  $$ m_{l}=+1 $$ ,
 we have

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos {\theta }_{1}=\frac{ L_{Z}}{L}=\frac{\frac{h}{2\pi }}{\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi }}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707 \text{.} $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{1}={\cos}^{-1}0.707= 45.0º. $$
</div>
Similarly, for  $${m}_{l}=0 $$ ,
 we find  $$\cos {\theta }_{2}=0 $$ ;  thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{2}={\cos}^{-1}0= 90.0º. $$
</div>
And for  $${m}_{l}=-1 $$ ,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos {\theta }_{3}=\frac{ L_{Z} }{L}=\frac{-\frac{h}{2\pi } }{\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi } }=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=-0.707\text{,} $$
</div>
so that

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{3}={\cos}^{-1}\left( -0.707\right)= 135.0º. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The angles are consistent with the figure. Only the angle relative to the $$z $$
-axis is quantized. $$L $$ can point in any direction as long as it makes the
proper angle with the $$z $$ -axis. Thus the angular momentum vectors lie on
cones as illustrated. This behavior is not observed on the large scale. To see
how the correspondence principle holds here, consider that the smallest angle (
$${\theta }_{1} $$ in the example) is for the maximum value of $${m}_{l}=0 $$ ,
namely $${m}_{l}=l $$ . For that smallest angle,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos \theta =\frac{ L_{z} }{L}=\frac{l}{\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}}\text{,} $$
</div>
which approaches 1 as  $$l $$
 becomes very large. If  $$\cos \theta =1 $$ ,
 then $$\theta =0º $$ .
 Furthermore, for large  $$l $$ ,
 there are many values of  $${m}_{l} $$ ,
 so that all angles become possible as  $$l $$  gets very large.

### Intrinsic Spin Angular Momentum Is Quantized in Magnitude and Direction

There are two more quantum numbers of immediate concern. Both were first
discovered for electrons in conjunction with fine structure in atomic spectra.
It is now well established that electrons and other fundamental particles have _
intrinsic spin_, roughly analogous to a planet spinning on its axis. This spin
is a fundamental characteristic of particles, and only one magnitude of
intrinsic spin is allowed for a given type of particle. Intrinsic angular
momentum is quantized independently of orbital angular momentum. Additionally,
the direction of the spin is also quantized. It has been found that the **magnitude of the intrinsic (internal) spin angular momentum**, $$S $$ , of an
electron is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$S=\sqrt{s\left(s+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left( s=1/2 \text{for electrons} \right) , $$
</div>

where $$s $$ is defined to be the **spin quantum number**. This is very similar
to the quantization of $$L $$ given in $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ , except that the only value allowed for $$s $$ for electrons is 1/2.

The _direction of intrinsic spin is quantized_, just as is the direction of
orbital angular momentum. The direction of spin angular momentum along one
direction in space, again called the $$z $$ -axis, can have only the values

<div class="equation" >
 $${S}_{z}={m}_{s}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{s}=-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2}\right) $$
</div>

for electrons. $${S}_{z} $$ is the ** $$z $$ -component of spin angular
momentum** and $${m}_{s} $$ is the **spin projection quantum number**. For
electrons, $$s $$ can only be 1/2, and $${m}_{s} $$ can be either +1/2 or -1/2.
Spin projection $${m}_{s}=+1/2 $$ is referred to as _spin up_, whereas $${m}_ {s}=-1/2 $$ is called _spin down_. These are illustrated
in [[Figure 5]](../contents/ch30PatternsInSpectraRevealMoreQuantization#Figure5).

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Intrinsic Spin
</div>
In later chapters, we will see that intrinsic spin is a characteristic of all subatomic particles. For some particles  $$s $$
 is half-integral, whereas for others  $$s $$
 is integral—there are crucial differences between half-integral spin particles and integral spin particles. Protons and neutrons, like electrons, have  $$s=1/2 $$ ,
 whereas photons have  $$s=1 $$ ,
 and other particles called pions have  $$s=0 $$ ,  and so on.

</div>

To summarize, the state of a system, such as the precise nature of an electron
in an atom, is determined by its particular quantum numbers. These are expressed
in the form $$\left(\mathrm{n, l,} {m}_{l}, {m}_{s}\right) $$
—see [[Table 1]](#Table1) *For electrons in atoms*, the principal quantum number
can have the values $$n=1, 2, 3, ... $$ . Once $$n $$ is known, the values of
the angular momentum quantum number are limited to $$l=1, 2, 3, ...,n-1 $$ . For
a given value of $$l $$ , the angular momentum projection quantum number can
have only the values $${m}_{l}=-l, -l +1, ...,-1, 0, 1, ..., l-1, l $$ .
Electron spin is independent of $$\mathrm{n, l,} $$ and $${m}_{l} $$ , always
having $$s=1/2 $$ . The spin projection quantum number can have two values,
$${m}\_{s}=1/2 \text{ or } -1/2 $$.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows several hydrogen states corresponding to different
sets of quantum numbers. Note that these clouds of probability are the locations
of electrons as determined by making repeated measurements—each measurement
finds the electron in a definite location, with a greater chance of finding the
electron in some places rather than others. With repeated measurements, the
pattern of probability shown in the figure emerges. The clouds of probability do
not look like nor do they correspond to classical orbits. The uncertainty
principle actually prevents us and nature from knowing how the electron gets
from one place to another, and so an orbit really does not exist as such. Nature
on a small scale is again much different from that on the large scale.

We will see that the quantum numbers discussed in this section are valid for a
broad range of particles and other systems, such as nuclei. Some quantum
numbers, such as intrinsic spin, are related to fundamental classifications of
subatomic particles, and they obey laws that will give us further insight into
the substructure of matter and its interactions.

### Section Summary

- Quantum numbers are used to express the allowed values of quantized entities.
  The principal quantum number $$n $$ labels the basic states of a system and is
  given by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$n=1, 2, 3,\text{...}. $$
  </div>

- The magnitude of angular momentum is given by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left(l=0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\right), $$
  </div>
     where
   $$l $$ is the angular momentum quantum number. The direction of angular momentum is quantized, in that its component along an axis defined by a magnetic field, called the
   $$z $$
    -axis is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${L}_{z}={m}_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{l}=-l,-l+1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ... l-1, l\right)\text{,} $$
  </div>
     where
   $${L}_{z} $$ is the
   $$z $$
    -component of the angular momentum and
   $${m}_{l} $$ is the angular momentum projection quantum number. Similarly, the electron’s intrinsic spin angular momentum
   $$S $$ is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$S=\sqrt{s\left(s+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi }  \left( s=1/2 \text{for electrons} \right) \text{.} $$
  </div>
  $$s $$ is defined to be the spin quantum number. Finally, the direction of the
  electron’s spin along the $$z $$ -axis is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${S}_{z}={m}_{s}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{s}=-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2}\right)\text{,} $$
  </div>
     where
   $${S}_{z} $$ is the
   $$z $$
    -component of spin angular momentum and
   $${m}_{s} $$ is the spin projection quantum number. Spin projection
   $${m}_{s}=+1/2 $$ is referred to as spin up, whereas
   $${m}_{s}=-1/2 $$ is called spin down. [[Table 1]](#Table1) summarizes the atomic quantum numbers and their allowed values.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If an atom has an electron in the  $$n=5 $$
 state with  $${m}_{l}=3 $$ ,
 what are the possible values of  $$l $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to apply the rules for quantum numbers. The angular momentum quantum number $$ l $$ must satisfy two constraints: (1) For a given principal quantum number $$ n $$ , the allowed values of $$ l $$ are $$ l = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 $$ ; and (2) The angular momentum projection quantum number $$ m_l $$ is constrained by $$ |m_l| \le l $$ . We need to find which values of $$ l $$ satisfy both conditions when $$ n = 5 $$ and $$ m_l = 3 $$ .

**Solution**

Given that $$ n = 5 $$ , the first constraint tells us that:
<div class="equation">
$$ l = 0, 1, 2, 3, \text{ or } 4 $$
</div>

Given that $$ m_l = 3 $$ , the second constraint requires:
<div class="equation">
$$ |m_l| \le l $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 3 \le l $$
</div>

Combining both constraints, we need $$ l \ge 3 $$ and $$ l \le 4 $$ (since $$ l < n = 5 $$ ).

Therefore, the possible values are: **l = 3 or l = 4**

If $$ l = 3 $$ (f-orbital), then $$ m_l $$ can be –3, –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, or +3, so $$ m_l = 3 $$ is allowed.

If $$ l = 4 $$ (g-orbital), then $$ m_l $$ can be –4, –3, –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, +3, or +4, so $$ m_l = 3 $$ is also allowed.

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates the hierarchical relationship between quantum numbers in atoms. The principal quantum number $$ n = 5 $$ places an upper limit on $$ l $$ ( $$ l \le 4 $$ ), while the value of $$ m_l = 3 $$ places a lower limit on $$ l $$ ( $$ l \ge 3 $$ ). The fact that $$ m_l = 3 $$ rules out $$ l = 0, 1, 2 $$ is physically reasonable: $$ m_l $$ represents the component of angular momentum along a specific axis, and this component cannot exceed the total angular momentum magnitude (which depends on $$ l $$ ). In spectroscopic notation, $$ l = 3 $$ corresponds to an f-orbital (named historically: s, p, d, f for $$ l = 0, 1, 2, 3 $$ ), and $$ l = 4 $$ corresponds to a g-orbital. These higher angular momentum states first appear in atoms with many electrons. For example, f-orbitals begin to fill in the lanthanide elements (starting with cerium, element 58), while g-orbitals are not occupied in the ground states of known elements but can be accessed in excited states. Understanding which quantum number combinations are allowed is crucial for predicting electron configurations, chemical bonding, and spectroscopic properties of atoms.

An atom has an electron with  $${m}_{l}=2 $$ .
 What is the smallest value of  $$n $$
 for this electron?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The angular momentum projection quantum number $$ m_l $$ is constrained by the angular momentum quantum number $$ l $$ through the relationship $$ |m_l| \le l $$ . Furthermore, for a given principal quantum number $$ n $$ , the angular momentum quantum number can only take values $$ l = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 $$ . Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of $$ n $$ such that $$ l $$ can be large enough to accommodate $$ m_l = 2 $$ .

**Solution**

Since $$ m_l = 2 $$ , we need $$ l \ge 2 $$ (because $$ |m_l| \le l $$ ).

The minimum value of $$ l $$ that satisfies this is $$ l = 2 $$ .

For $$ l = 2 $$ to be an allowed value, we need $$ l \le n - 1 $$ , which gives us $$ 2 \le n - 1 $$ , or $$ n \ge 3 $$ .

Therefore, the smallest value of $$ n $$ is **n = 3**.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the hierarchical relationship among the quantum numbers in atoms. The principal quantum number $$ n $$ determines the energy level and sets an upper limit on the angular momentum quantum number $$ l $$ . In turn, $$ l $$ determines the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum and sets limits on the possible values of $$ m_l $$ , which specifies the orientation of the angular momentum vector. For $$ n = 3 $$ , the allowed values of $$ l $$ are 0, 1, and 2. When $$ l = 2 $$ (called a d-orbital), $$ m_l $$ can take any of the five values: –2, –1, 0, +1, or +2. Each of these corresponds to a different orientation of the electron's orbital angular momentum relative to an external magnetic field. The fact that we need at least $$ n = 3 $$ for $$ m_l = 2 $$ explains why d-orbitals first appear in the third shell of atoms (the M shell), which is crucial for understanding the electron configurations of transition metals and their chemical properties.

Or more compactly: **$$ m_l = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3 $$**

**Discussion**

This problem reveals an important feature of atomic structure: for a given principal quantum number $$ n $$ , there are multiple orbitals with different angular momentum properties. The $$ n = 4 $$ shell contains 4s (1 orbital), 4p (3 orbitals), 4d (5 orbitals), and 4f (7 orbitals), for a total of 16 orbitals. Since each orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins), the $$ n = 4 $$ shell can accommodate up to 32 electrons. The seven distinct values of $$ m_l $$ ( –3 to +3 ) represent different orientations of the orbital angular momentum vector relative to an external magnetic field (the $$ z $$ -axis). In the absence of an external field, orbitals with the same $$ n $$ and $$ l $$ but different $$ m_l $$ values have the same energy (they are "degenerate"). However, when an external magnetic field is applied, this degeneracy is broken—the Zeeman effect causes each $$ m_l $$ value to correspond to a slightly different energy. This is why spectral lines split in magnetic fields. The maximum value of $$ |m_l| $$ equals the maximum value of $$ l $$ for that shell, which is $$ n - 1 $$ . Understanding these relationships is essential for explaining atomic spectra, magnetic properties of atoms, and the structure of the periodic table.

What, if any, constraints does a value of  $${m}_{l}=1 $$
 place on the other quantum numbers for an electron in an atom?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to examine the relationships between the quantum numbers to determine what constraints $$ m_l = 1 $$ places on the other quantum numbers ( $$ n $$ , $$ l $$ , and $$ m_s $$ ). The key relationships are: (1) $$ |m_l| \le l $$ , (2) $$ l \le n - 1 $$ , and (3) $$ m_s $$ is independent of the orbital quantum numbers.

**Solution**

Given that $$ m_l = 1 $$ :

**Constraint on l:** Since $$ |m_l| \le l $$ , we must have $$ l \ge 1 $$ . Therefore, the electron cannot be in an s-orbital ( $$ l = 0 $$ ) but could be in a p-orbital ( $$ l = 1 $$ ), d-orbital ( $$ l = 2 $$ ), f-orbital ( $$ l = 3 $$ ), or any higher angular momentum state.

**Constraint on n:** Since $$ l \ge 1 $$ and $$ l \le n - 1 $$ , we need $$ n - 1 \ge 1 $$ , which gives $$ n \ge 2 $$ . Therefore, the electron must be in the second shell or higher ( $$ n = 2, 3, 4, ... $$ ).

**Constraint on $$ m_s $$:** The spin projection quantum number $$ m_s $$ can be either +1/2 or –1/2, independent of the value of $$ m_l $$ . There is no constraint on $$ m_s $$ .

In summary:
- $$ l \ge 1 $$ (p, d, f, or higher orbitals)
- $$ n \ge 2 $$ (second shell or higher)
- $$ m_s = \pm 1/2 $$ (no constraint)

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates the interconnected nature of quantum numbers in atoms. The value of $$ m_l = 1 $$ tells us about the orientation of the electron's orbital angular momentum but doesn't uniquely specify the state of the electron. For example, the electron could be in a 2p orbital ( $$ n = 2, l = 1 $$ ), a 3p orbital ( $$ n = 3, l = 1 $$ ), a 3d orbital ( $$ n = 3, l = 2 $$ ), or many other possibilities. Each of these states would have different energies and different probability distributions for the electron's position. The fact that $$ m_l = 1 $$ excludes only s-orbitals ( $$ l = 0 $$ ) but allows all others shows that $$ m_l $$ specifies orientation rather than the magnitude of angular momentum. The independence of $$ m_s $$ reflects the fact that electron spin is an intrinsic property not related to orbital motion. Understanding these constraints is essential for writing electron configurations and predicting the chemical and spectroscopic properties of atoms.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The magnitude of angular momentum is given by the quantum mechanical formula $$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ , where $$ l $$ is the angular momentum quantum number and $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$ is Planck's constant. We'll substitute $$ l = 1 $$ and calculate.

(b) Bohr's original model proposed that the angular momentum of an electron in orbit is quantized as $$ L = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$ , where $$ n $$ is the principal quantum number. For the $$ n = 1 $$ state (ground state), Bohr predicted $$ L = \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ . We'll calculate this value and compare it to the quantum mechanical result.

**Solution**

(a) For $$ l = 1 $$ :
<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{1(1+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{2} \times \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2} \times 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ L = 1.49 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

(b) Bohr's value for the $$ n = 1 $$ state:
<div class="equation">
$$ L_{\text{Bohr}} = n \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1 \times \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2\pi} = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ L_{\text{Bohr}} = 1.06 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$

Comparing the two values:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{L_{l=1}}{L_{\text{Bohr}, n=1}} = \frac{1.49 \times 10^{-34}}{1.06 \times 10^{-34}} = 1.41 = \sqrt{2} $$
</div>

The quantum mechanical value for $$ l = 1 $$ is $$ \sqrt{2} $$ times larger than Bohr's prediction for $$ n = 1 $$ .

**Discussion**

This comparison reveals a fundamental difference between Bohr's semi-classical model and the full quantum mechanical treatment of the atom. Bohr correctly predicted that angular momentum is quantized, but his specific formula $$ L = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$ turned out to be incorrect. Modern quantum mechanics shows that (1) the magnitude of angular momentum depends on $$ l $$ , not $$ n $$ , and follows $$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ ; and (2) for a given $$ n $$ , $$ l $$ can range from 0 to $$ n-1 $$ , meaning different orbitals in the same shell have different angular momenta.

Most surprisingly, quantum mechanics reveals that the ground state of hydrogen ( $$ n = 1, l = 0 $$ ) has **zero** angular momentum, not $$ \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ as Bohr proposed! This is completely incompatible with Bohr's picture of electrons orbiting in circular paths. Instead, the $$ l = 0 $$ state (s-orbital) is spherically symmetric with no orbital angular momentum at all—the electron's probability cloud is centered on the nucleus with no preferred direction.

The $$ l = 1 $$ state we calculated represents a p-orbital, which has angular momentum and a more complex spatial structure. The factor $$ \sqrt{l(l+1)} $$ rather than just $$ l $$ appears because of the way angular momentum operators work in quantum mechanics—this same factor appears for all quantized angular momenta. The comparison shows that while Bohr's model was revolutionary and correct in predicting quantization, the details of quantum mechanics are more subtle and accurate. Nevertheless, Bohr's achievement in introducing quantization to atomic physics was a crucial step toward the modern theory.

(a) What is the magnitude of the angular momentum for an  $$l=1 $$
 electron?
(b) Calculate the magnitude of the electron's spin angular momentum.
(c) What is the ratio of these angular momenta?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll use the formulas for quantized angular momentum. For orbital angular momentum: $$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ . For spin angular momentum: $$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ , where $$ s = 1/2 $$ for electrons. We'll calculate both values and then find their ratio.

**Solution**

(a) For $$ l = 1 $$ , the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is:

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{1(1+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

Substituting $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{2} \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2} (1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}) = 1.49 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

(b) For electron spin with $$ s = 1/2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+1\right)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2}} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ S = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}) = 9.13 \times 10^{-35} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

(c) The ratio of orbital to spin angular momentum is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{L}{S} = \frac{\sqrt{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot 2}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} = 1.63 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This calculation reveals several important aspects of atomic structure. First, both orbital and spin angular momenta are on the order of $$ 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$ , which is the same order as Planck's constant divided by $$ 2\pi $$ (often written as $$ \hbar $$ ). This demonstrates that atomic-scale angular momentum is quantized in units of $$ \hbar $$ . Second, the ratio of about 1.63 shows that for an $$ l = 1 $$ electron (a p-orbital), the orbital angular momentum is somewhat larger than the spin angular momentum, but they are of the same order of magnitude. This comparability is important because both contribute to the total angular momentum of the atom and both interact with external magnetic fields. The spin-orbit coupling—the interaction between the electron's orbital and spin magnetic moments—leads to fine structure in atomic spectra. For different values of $$ l $$ , this ratio changes: for $$ l = 3 $$ (next problem), the ratio is 4, showing that as $$ l $$ increases, orbital angular momentum dominates over spin. Understanding these relationships is crucial for explaining magnetic properties of atoms, spectroscopic splitting patterns, and the behavior of atoms in external magnetic fields.

**Strategy**

Following the same approach as Exercise 7, we'll calculate: (a) the magnitude of orbital angular momentum for $$ l = 3 $$ using $$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ ; (b) the magnitude of electron spin angular momentum using $$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ where $$ s = 1/2 $$ ; (c) the ratio of these two quantities.

**Solution**

(a) For $$ l = 3 $$ , the magnitude of orbital angular momentum is:

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{3(3+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{12} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{12} \times \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2\pi} = \sqrt{12} \times (1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ L = 3.464 \times (1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}) = 3.66 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$

(b) The electron spin angular momentum (same for all electrons regardless of $$ l $$ ):

<div class="equation">
$$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+1\right)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ S = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times (1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}) = 9.13 \times 10^{-35} \text{ J·s} $$
</div>

(c) The ratio of orbital to spin angular momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{L}{S} = \frac{\sqrt{12} \frac{h}{2\pi}}{\sqrt{3/4} \frac{h}{2\pi}} = \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{3/4}} = \frac{\sqrt{12} \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \times 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 4 $$
</div>

The ratio is **4**.

**Discussion**

Comparing this result to Exercise 7 (where $$ l = 1 $$ gave a ratio of 1.63), we see that as $$ l $$ increases, the orbital angular momentum becomes much larger relative to the spin angular momentum. For $$ l = 3 $$ (an f-orbital), the orbital angular momentum is exactly 4 times the spin angular momentum, whereas for $$ l = 1 $$ (a p-orbital) it was only 1.63 times larger. This makes sense because orbital angular momentum scales as $$ \sqrt{l(l+1)} $$ , which grows roughly as $$ \sqrt{l^2} = l $$ for large $$ l $$ , while spin angular momentum is fixed at $$ \sqrt{3/4} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ for all electrons. The $$ l = 3 $$ state corresponds to f-orbitals, which first appear in the fourth shell (n = 4) and are important in the chemistry of lanthanide and actinide elements. The large orbital angular momentum of f-electrons contributes significantly to the magnetic properties of these elements. Both orbital and spin angular momenta couple together to give the total angular momentum of the atom, and this coupling is responsible for fine structure in atomic spectra and for the magnetic moments of atoms. The fact that orbital angular momentum can vary widely (depending on $$ l $$ ) while spin is always the same ($$ s = 1/2 $$ for electrons) means that the relative importance of spin-orbit coupling varies greatly for different orbitals—it's more important for s and p electrons (low $$ l $$ ) than for d and f electrons (high $$ l $$ ) in terms of the fractional contribution.

(b) Calculate the value of the smallest angle.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a given value of $$ l $$ , the angular momentum projection quantum number $$ m_l $$ can take values from $$ -l $$ to $$ +l $$ in integer steps, giving $$ 2l + 1 $$ possible values. Each value of $$ m_l $$ corresponds to a different angle that the angular momentum vector $$ \mathbf{L} $$ makes with the $$ z $$ -axis. The angle can be found from $$ \cos \theta = \frac{L_z}{L} = \frac{m_l}{\sqrt{l(l+1)}} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) For $$ l = 2 $$ , the possible values of $$ m_l $$ are:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 $$
</div>

This gives $$ 2l + 1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5 $$ possible orientations. Therefore, $$ \mathbf{L} $$ can make **5 different angles** with the $$ z $$ -axis.

(b) The smallest angle occurs when $$ m_l $$ has its maximum value, $$ m_l = +2 $$ (or minimum value $$ m_l = -2 $$ , which gives the same angle by symmetry). The magnitude of $$ \mathbf{L} $$ is:

<div class="equation">
$$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2(2+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{6} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$

The $$ z $$ -component is:
<div class="equation">
$$ L_z = m_l \frac{h}{2\pi} = 2 \frac{h}{2\pi} $$

The angle is given by:
<div class="equation">
$$ \cos \theta = \frac{L_z}{L} = \frac{2 \frac{h}{2\pi}}{\sqrt{6} \frac{h}{2\pi}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{6}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} = 0.8165 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \theta = \cos^{-1}(0.8165) = 35.3° $$
</div>

The smallest angle is **35.3°** (or **0.616 radians**).

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the concept of space quantization—the remarkable fact that the angular momentum vector can only point in certain discrete directions relative to an external reference direction (the $$ z $$ -axis, typically defined by an external magnetic field). For $$ l = 2 $$ (a d-orbital), the five allowed angles correspond to the five d-orbitals in chemistry ( $$ d_{z^2}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}, d_{xy}, d_{x^2-y^2} $$ ). The smallest angle of 35.3° represents the most closely aligned orientation—even at this "closest" alignment, the angular momentum vector cannot point directly along the $$ z $$ -axis. This is fundamentally different from classical physics, where a rotating object could have its angular momentum pointing in any direction. The fact that even the maximum value of $$ m_l = l $$ doesn't allow perfect alignment ( $$ \theta = 0° $$ ) is due to the quantum mechanical relationship $$ L = \sqrt{l(l+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ rather than $$ l\frac{h}{2\pi} $$ . This " $$ \sqrt{l(l+1)} $$ " factor, rather than just " $$ l $$ ," ensures that $$ L > L_z $$ for all states, preventing perfect alignment and reflecting the uncertainty principle's constraint on simultaneously knowing all components of angular momentum.

What angles can the spin  $$S $$ of an electron make with the  $$z $$

**Strategy**

For electron spin, the spin quantum number is $$ s = 1/2 $$ , and the spin projection quantum number $$ m_s $$ can be either $$ +1/2 $$ (spin up) or $$ -1/2 $$ (spin down). The magnitude of the spin angular momentum is $$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ , and its $$ z $$ -component is $$ S_z = m_s \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ . The angle between $$ \mathbf{S} $$ and the $$ z $$ -axis can be found from $$ \cos \theta = \frac{S_z}{S} $$ .

**Solution**

The magnitude of electron spin is:
<div class="equation">
$$ S = \sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+1\right)} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \frac{h}{2\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

The $$ z $$ -component can have two values:
<div class="equation">
$$ S_z = m_s \frac{h}{2\pi} = \pm \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

For $$ m_s = +1/2 $$ (spin up):

$$ \cos \theta_1 = \frac{S_z}{S} = \frac{+\frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}} = \frac{1/2}{\sqrt{3}/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 0.5774 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \theta_1 = \cos^{-1}(0.5774) = 54.7° $$

For $$ m_s = -1/2 $$ (spin down):
<div class="equation">
$$ \cos \theta_2 = \frac{S_z}{S} = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi}} = \frac{-1/2}{\sqrt{3}/2} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = -0.5774 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \theta_2 = \cos^{-1}(-0.5774) = 125.3° $$
</div>

The electron spin can make only two angles with the $$ z $$ -axis: **54.7°** and **125.3°**.

**Discussion**

This result demonstrates the quantization of spin direction—a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon with no classical analogue. Unlike orbital angular momentum, where the number of allowed angles depends on $$ l $$ (giving $$ 2l+1 $$ orientations), electron spin always has exactly two allowed orientations regardless of the atom or state. These two orientations are commonly called "spin up" and "spin down," though these names are somewhat misleading since the spin is never aligned parallel or antiparallel to the $$ z $$ -axis.

Notice that even for the "spin up" state ( $$ m_s = +1/2 $$ ), the angle is 54.7° rather than 0°—the spin cannot point directly along the $$ z $$ -axis. This is a consequence of the $$ \sqrt{s(s+1)} $$ factor in the magnitude formula: since $$ S = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ is always larger than $$ |S_z| = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{2\pi} $$ , perfect alignment is impossible. This reflects a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: you cannot simultaneously know all three components of angular momentum (Heisenberg uncertainty principle for angular momentum).

The two angles are symmetric about 90°: one is 90° – 35.3° = 54.7°, and the other is 90° + 35.3° = 125.3°. This symmetry reflects the fact that the two spin states have equal magnitude angular momenta, just pointing in generally opposite directions.

Electron spin is fundamental to understanding: (1) the Pauli exclusion principle—two electrons in the same orbital must have opposite spins; (2) magnetic properties of materials—unpaired electron spins create magnetic moments; (3) fine structure in atomic spectra—spin-orbit coupling splits spectral lines; (4) modern technologies like MRI, which depends on nuclear spin (similar to electron spin but for protons), and spintronics, which exploits electron spin for information storage and processing.
