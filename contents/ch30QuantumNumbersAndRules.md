Physical characteristics that are quantized—such as energy, charge, and angular
momentum—are of such importance that names and symbols are given to them. The
values of quantized entities are expressed in terms of **quantum numbers**, and
the rules governing them are of the utmost importance in determining what nature
is and does. This section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and
rules—all of which apply in chemistry, material science, and far beyond the
realm of atomic physics, where they were first discovered. Once again, we see
how physics makes discoveries which enable other fields to grow.

The *energy states of bound systems are quantized*, because the particle
wavelength can fit into the bounds of the system in only certain ways. This was
elaborated for the hydrogen atom, for which the allowed energies are expressed
as $${E}_{n}\propto 1/{n}^{2} $$ , where $$n=1, 2, 3, ... $$ . We define $$n $$
to be the principal quantum number that labels the basic states of a system. The
lowest-energy state has $$n=1 $$ , the first excited state has $$n=2 $$ , and so
on. Thus the allowed values for the principal quantum number are

<div class="equation" >
 $$n=1, 2, 3, .... $$
</div>

This is more than just a numbering scheme, since the energy of the system, such
as the hydrogen atom, can be expressed as some function of $$n $$ , as can other
characteristics (such as the orbital radii of the hydrogen atom).

The fact that the *magnitude of angular momentum is quantized* was first
recognized by Bohr in relation to the hydrogen atom; it is now known to be true
in general. With the development of quantum mechanics, it was found that the
magnitude of angular momentum $$L $$ can have only the values

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left(l=0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$l $$ is defined to be the **angular momentum quantum number**. The rule
for $$l $$ in atoms is given in the parentheses. Given $$n $$ , the value of $$l
$$ can be any integer from zero up to $$n-1 $$ . For example, if $$n=4 $$ , then
$$l $$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Note that for $$n=1 $$ , $$l $$ can only be zero. This means that the
ground-state angular momentum for hydrogen is actually zero, not $$h/2\pi $$ as
Bohr proposed. The picture of circular orbits is not valid, because there would
be angular momentum for any circular orbit. A more valid picture is the cloud of
probability shown for the ground state of hydrogen
in [[link]](../contents/ch30TheWaveNatureOfMatterCausesQuantization#import-auto-id2396594). The electron actually spends time in
and near the nucleus. The reason the electron does not remain in the nucleus is
related to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle—the electron’s energy would have
to be much too large to be confined to the small space of the nucleus. Now the
first excited state of hydrogen has $$n=2 $$ , so that $$l $$ can be either 0 or
1, according to the rule in $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ .
Similarly, for $$n=3 $$ , $$l $$ can be 0, 1, or 2. It is often most convenient
to state the value of $$l $$ , a simple integer, rather than calculating the
value of $$L $$ from $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ . For
example, for $$l=2 $$ , we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\sqrt{2\left(2+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi }=\sqrt{6}\frac{h}{2\pi }= 0.390h= 2.58 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J}\cdot s. $$
</div>

It is much simpler to state $$l=2 $$.

As recognized in the Zeeman effect, the *direction of angular momentum is
quantized*. We now know this is true in all circumstances. It is found that the
component of angular momentum along one direction in space, usually called the
$$z $$ -axis, can have only certain values of $${L}_{z} $$ . The direction in
space must be related to something physical, such as the direction of the
magnetic field at that location. This is an aspect of relativity. Direction has
no meaning if there is nothing that varies with direction, as does magnetic
force. The allowed values of $${L}_{z} $$ are

<div class="equation" >
 $${L}_{z}={m}_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left( {m}_{l}=-l,-l+1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ... l-1, l\right) \text{,} $$
</div>

where $${L}_{z} $$ is the  $$z $$-**component of the angular momentum** and
$${m}_{l} $$ is the angular momentum projection quantum number. The rule in
parentheses for the values of $${m}_{l} $$ is that it can range from $$-l $$ to
$$l $$ in steps of one. For example, if $$l=2 $$ , then $${m}_{l} $$ can have
the five values –2, –1, 0, 1, and 2. Each $${m}_{l} $$ corresponds to a
different energy in the presence of a magnetic field, so that they are related
to the splitting of spectral lines into discrete parts, as discussed in the
preceding section. If the $$z $$ -component of angular momentum can have only
certain values, then the angular momentum can have only certain directions, as
illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

![The image shows two possible values of component of a given angular momentum along z-axis. One circular orbit above the original circular orbit is shown for m sub l value of plus one. Another circular orbit below the original circular orbit is shown for m sub l value of minus one. The angular momentum vector for the top circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub one with the vertical axis. The horizontal angular momentum vector at original circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub two with the vertical axis. The angular momentum vector for the bottom circular orbit makes an angle of theta sub three with the vertical axis.](../resources/Figure_30_08_00a.jpg "The component of a given angular momentum along the z-axis (defined by the direction of a magnetic field) can have only certain values; these are shown here for l=1, for which \( m_\text{l}=-1, 0, \text\{ and \} +1 \) . The direction of L is quantized in the sense that it can have only certain angles relative to the z-axis.")

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
What Are the Allowed Directions?
</div>
Calculate the angles that the angular momentum vector  $$\vb{L} $$
  can make with the  $$z $$
-axis for  $$l=1 $$ ,
 as illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

**Strategy**

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) represents the vectors $$\vb{L} $$ and
$${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ as usual, with arrows proportional to their
magnitudes and pointing in the correct directions. $$\vb{L} $$ and
$${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ form a right triangle, with $$\vb{L} $$ being
the hypotenuse and $${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ the adjacent side. This means
that the ratio of $${\vb{L}}_{z} $$ to $$\vb{L} $$ is the cosine of the
angle of interest. We can find $$\vb{L} $$ and $${\vb{L}}_
{z} $$ using $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$ and $${L}_
{z}=m\frac{h}{2\pi } $$.

**Solution**

We are given $$l=1 $$ , so that $${m}_{l} $$ can be +1, 0, or −1. Thus $$L $$
has the value given by $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}h}{2\pi }=\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi } $$
</div>
 $$L_{z} $$ can have three values, given by  $$L_{z}= m_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$ L_{z}=m_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi }=\left\{
\begin{array}{cccc} \frac{h}{2\pi },&  {m}_{l}& =& +1 \\ 
0, & {m}_{l}& =& 0 \\ 
-\frac{h}{2\pi },&  {m}_{l}& =& -1
\end{array}
\right\} $$
</div>
As can be seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1),  $$\cos \theta =\frac{ L_{z} }{L} , $$
 and so for  $$ m_{l}=+1 $$ ,
 we have

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos {\theta }_{1}=\frac{ L_{Z}}{L}=\frac{\frac{h}{2\pi }}{\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi }}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707 \text{.} $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{1}={\cos}^{-1}0.707= 45.0º. $$
</div>
Similarly, for  $${m}_{l}=0 $$ ,
 we find  $$\cos {\theta }_{2}=0 $$ ;  thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{2}={\cos}^{-1}0= 90.0º. $$
</div>
And for  $${m}_{l}=-1 $$ ,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos {\theta }_{3}=\frac{ L_{Z} }{L}=\frac{-\frac{h}{2\pi } }{\frac{\sqrt{2}h}{2\pi } }=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=-0.707\text{,} $$
</div>
so that

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{3}={\cos}^{-1}\left( -0.707\right)= 135.0º. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The angles are consistent with the figure. Only the angle relative to the $$z $$
-axis is quantized. $$L $$ can point in any direction as long as it makes the
proper angle with the $$z $$ -axis. Thus the angular momentum vectors lie on
cones as illustrated. This behavior is not observed on the large scale. To see
how the correspondence principle holds here, consider that the smallest angle (
$${\theta }_{1} $$ in the example) is for the maximum value of $${m}_{l}=0 $$ ,
namely $${m}_{l}=l $$ . For that smallest angle,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\cos \theta =\frac{ L_{z} }{L}=\frac{l}{\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}}\text{,} $$
</div>
which approaches 1 as  $$l $$
 becomes very large. If  $$\cos \theta =1 $$ ,
 then $$\theta =0º $$ .
 Furthermore, for large  $$l $$ ,
 there are many values of  $${m}_{l} $$ ,
 so that all angles become possible as  $$l $$  gets very large.

### Intrinsic Spin Angular Momentum Is Quantized in Magnitude and Direction

There are two more quantum numbers of immediate concern. Both were first
discovered for electrons in conjunction with fine structure in atomic spectra.
It is now well established that electrons and other fundamental particles have *
intrinsic spin*, roughly analogous to a planet spinning on its axis. This spin
is a fundamental characteristic of particles, and only one magnitude of
intrinsic spin is allowed for a given type of particle. Intrinsic angular
momentum is quantized independently of orbital angular momentum. Additionally,
the direction of the spin is also quantized. It has been found that the **magnitude of the intrinsic (internal) spin angular momentum**, $$S $$ , of an
electron is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$S=\sqrt{s\left(s+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left( s=1/2 \text{for electrons} \right) , $$
</div>

where $$s $$ is defined to be the **spin quantum number**. This is very similar
to the quantization of $$L $$ given in $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi
} $$ , except that the only value allowed for $$s $$ for electrons is 1/2.

The *direction of intrinsic spin is quantized*, just as is the direction of
orbital angular momentum. The direction of spin angular momentum along one
direction in space, again called the $$z $$ -axis, can have only the values

<div class="equation" >
 $${S}_{z}={m}_{s}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{s}=-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2}\right) $$
</div>

for electrons. $${S}_{z} $$ is the ** $$z $$ -component of spin angular
momentum** and $${m}_{s} $$ is the **spin projection quantum number**. For
electrons, $$s $$ can only be 1/2, and $${m}_{s} $$ can be either +1/2 or -1/2.
Spin projection $${m}_{s}=+1/2 $$ is referred to as *spin up*, whereas $${m}_
{s}=-1/2 $$ is called *spin down*. These are illustrated
in [[link]](../contents/ch30PatternsInSpectraRevealMoreQuantization#import-auto-id1870582).

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Intrinsic Spin
</div>
In later chapters, we will see that intrinsic spin is a characteristic of all subatomic particles. For some particles  $$s $$
 is half-integral, whereas for others  $$s $$
 is integral—there are crucial differences between half-integral spin particles and integral spin particles. Protons and neutrons, like electrons, have  $$s=1/2 $$ ,
 whereas photons have  $$s=1 $$ ,
 and other particles called pions have  $$s=0 $$ ,  and so on.

</div>

To summarize, the state of a system, such as the precise nature of an electron
in an atom, is determined by its particular quantum numbers. These are expressed
in the form $$\left(\mathrm{n, l,} {m}_{l}, {m}_{s}\right) $$
—see [[Table 1]](#Table1) *For electrons in atoms*, the principal quantum number
can have the values $$n=1, 2, 3, ... $$ . Once $$n $$ is known, the values of
the angular momentum quantum number are limited to $$l=1, 2, 3, ...,n-1 $$ . For
a given value of $$l $$ , the angular momentum projection quantum number can
have only the values $${m}_{l}=-l, -l +1, ...,-1, 0, 1, ..., l-1, l $$ .
Electron spin is independent of $$\mathrm{n, l,} $$ and $${m}_{l} $$ , always
having $$s=1/2 $$ . The spin projection quantum number can have two values,
$${m}_{s}=1/2 \text{ or } -1/2 $$.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows several hydrogen states corresponding to different
sets of quantum numbers. Note that these clouds of probability are the locations
of electrons as determined by making repeated measurements—each measurement
finds the electron in a definite location, with a greater chance of finding the
electron in some places rather than others. With repeated measurements, the
pattern of probability shown in the figure emerges. The clouds of probability do
not look like nor do they correspond to classical orbits. The uncertainty
principle actually prevents us and nature from knowing how the electron gets
from one place to another, and so an orbit really does not exist as such. Nature
on a small scale is again much different from that on the large scale.

![The image shows probability clouds for the electron in the ground state and several excited states of hydrogen. Sets of quantum numbers given as n l m subscript l are shown for each state. The ground state is zero zero zero. The probability of finding the electron is indicated by the shade of color.](../resources/Figure_30_08_01a.jpg "Probability clouds for the electron in the ground state and several excited states of hydrogen.

We will see that the quantum numbers discussed in this section are valid for a
broad range of particles and other systems, such as nuclei. Some quantum
numbers, such as intrinsic spin, are related to fundamental classifications of
subatomic particles, and they obey laws that will give us further insight into
the substructure of matter and its interactions.

### Section Summary

* Quantum numbers are used to express the allowed values of quantized entities.
  The principal quantum number $$n $$ labels the basic states of a system and is
  given by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$n=1, 2, 3,\text{...}. $$
  </div>

* The magnitude of angular momentum is given by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left(l=0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\right), $$
  </div>
     where
   $$l $$ is the angular momentum quantum number. The direction of angular momentum is quantized, in that its component along an axis defined by a magnetic field, called the
   $$z $$
    -axis is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${L}_{z}={m}_{l}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{l}=-l,-l+1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ... l-1, l\right)\text{,} $$
  </div>
     where
   $${L}_{z} $$ is the
   $$z $$
    -component of the angular momentum and
   $${m}_{l} $$ is the angular momentum projection quantum number. Similarly, the electron’s intrinsic spin angular momentum
   $$S $$ is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$S=\sqrt{s\left(s+1\right)}\frac{h}{2\pi }  \left( s=1/2 \text{for electrons} \right) \text{.} $$
  </div>
  $$s $$ is defined to be the spin quantum number. Finally, the direction of the
  electron’s spin along the $$z $$ -axis is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${S}_{z}={m}_{s}\frac{h}{2\pi } \left({m}_{s}=-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2}\right)\text{,} $$
  </div>
     where
   $${S}_{z} $$ is the
   $$z $$
    -component of spin angular momentum and
   $${m}_{s} $$ is the spin projection quantum number. Spin projection
   $${m}_{s}=+1/2 $$ is referred to as spin up, whereas
   $${m}_{s}=-1/2 $$ is called spin down. [[Table 1]](#Table1) summarizes the atomic quantum numbers and their allowed values.
