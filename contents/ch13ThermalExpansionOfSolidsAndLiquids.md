The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered
examples of **thermal expansion**, the change in size or volume of a given mass
with temperature. Hot air rises because its volume increases, which causes the
hot air’s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a
buoyant (upward) force on the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and
gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and weather
systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for
example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with
temperature changes.

What are the basic properties of thermal expansion? First, thermal expansion is
clearly related to temperature change. The greater the temperature change, the
more a bimetallic strip will bend. Second, it depends on the material. In a
thermometer, for example, the expansion of alcohol is much greater than the
expansion of the glass containing it.

What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As is discussed
in [Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature](./ch13KineticTheory)
, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the
individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are
closely packed together, but their kinetic energy (in the form of small, rapid
vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This
neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average,
between neighbors, and adds up to a larger size for the whole body. For most
substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and an
increase in temperature will increase the solid’s size by a certain fraction in
each dimension.

Linear Thermal Expansion—Thermal Expansion in One Dimension
</div>
The change in length  $$\Delta L $$  is proportional to length  $$L $$ .
 The dependence of thermal expansion on temperature, substance, and length is summarized in the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T, $$
</div>
where  $$\Delta L $$
 is the change in length  $$L $$,  $$\Delta T $$
 is the change in temperature, and  $$\alpha  $$  is the **coefficient of linear expansion**, which varies slightly with temperature.

</div>

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists representative values of the coefficient of linear
expansion, which may have units of $$1/\text{ºC} $$ or 1/K. Because the size of
a kelvin and a degree Celsius are the same, both $$\alpha $$ and $$\Delta T $$
can be expressed in units of kelvins or degrees Celsius. The equation $$\Delta
L=\alpha L\Delta T $$ is accurate for small changes in temperature and can be
used for large changes in temperature if an average value of $$\alpha $$ is
used.

Calculating Linear Thermal Expansion: The Golden Gate Bridge
</div>
The main span of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge is 1275 m long at its coldest. The bridge is exposed to temperatures ranging from  $$-15\text{ºC} $$
 to  $$40\text{ºC} $$ .
 What is its change in length between these temperatures? Assume that the bridge is made entirely of steel.

**Strategy**

Use the equation for linear thermal expansion $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T $$ to
calculate the change in length , $$\Delta L $$ . Use the coefficient of linear
expansion, $$\alpha $$ , for steel from [[Table 1]](#Table1), and note that the
change in temperature, $$\Delta T $$ , is $$55\text{ºC} $$.

**Solution**

Plug all of the known values into the equation to solve for $$\Delta L $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T=\left(\frac{12 \times 10^{-6} }{\text{ºC}}\right)\left(1275 \text{m}\right)\left(55\text{ºC}\right)=0.84 \text{m} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Although not large compared with the length of the bridge, this change in length
is observable. It is generally spread over many expansion joints so that the
expansion at each joint is small.

</div>

### Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions

Objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). That
is, their areas and volumes, as well as their lengths, increase with
temperature. Holes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a
metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the plug
was still in place. The plug would get bigger, and so the hole must get bigger
too. (Think of the ring of neighboring atoms or molecules on the wall of the
hole as pushing each other farther apart as temperature increases. Obviously,
the ring of neighbors must get slightly larger, so the hole gets slightly
larger).

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions
</div>
For small temperature changes, the change in area  $$\Delta A $$
 is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta A=2\alpha A\Delta T, $$
</div>
where  $$\Delta A $$  is the change in area  $$A $$ ,
  $$\Delta T $$
 is the change in temperature, and  $$\alpha  $$
 is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.

Part b shows the outline of a flat metal plate with a hole in it, before and after expansion. The hole expands. Part c shows the outline of a rectangular box before and after expansion. After expansion, the box has the same proportions as before expansion, but it has a greater volume.](../resources/Figure_13_02_02.jpg 'In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the objects are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width increase. The area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing temperature, just as if the expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase.')

The change in volume  $$\Delta V $$
 is very nearly  $$\Delta V=3\alpha V\Delta T $$ .
 This equation is usually written as

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\beta V\Delta T\text{,} $$
</div>
where  $$\beta  $$  is the **coefficient of volume expansion** and  $$\beta \approx 3\alpha  $$ .
 Note that the values of  $$\beta  $$  in [[Table 1]](#Table1) are almost exactly equal to  $$3\alpha  $$.

</div>

In general, objects will expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most
important exception to this rule. Water expands with increasing temperature (its
density _decreases_) when it is at temperatures greater than $$4\text{ºC}\left(
40\text{ºF}\right) $$ . However, it expands with *decreasing* temperature when
it is between $$+4\text{ºC} $$ and $$0\text{ºC} $$  ( $$40\text{ºF} $$ to
$$32\text{ºF}$$) . Water is densest at $$+4\text{ºC} $$ .
(See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) Perhaps the most striking effect of this
phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools
down to $$4\text{ºC} $$ it is denser than the remaining water and thus will sink
to the bottom. This “turnover” results in a layer of warmer water near the
surface, which is then cooled. Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of
$$4\text{ºC} $$ . If the temperature in the surface layer drops below
$$4\text{ºC} $$ , the water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays
near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely freeze over. The ice
on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter’s harsh exterior
air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in $$4\text{ºC} $$
water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water. It also produces
circulation of water in the pond that is necessary for a healthy ecosystem of
the body of water.

At zero degrees C, the density is just under zero point nine nine nine five grams per cubic centimeter. The density then increases at a decreasing rate until it hits a peak of about zero point nine nine nine nine seven grams per cubic centimeter at about four degrees C. Above four degrees C, the density decreases with increasing temperature.](../resources/Figure_13_02_03.jpg 'The density of water as a function of temperature.

Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank
</div>
Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands much more than steel, and so it may overflow.

This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the
gasoline gauge. The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the
gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The gasoline
has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on,
but because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to
getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter, beware—you will probably run
out much more quickly in the summer.

![Fuel gauge pointing to empty.](../resources/Figure_13_02_04.jpg 'Because the gas expands more than the gas tank with increasing temperature, you can’t drive as many miles on “empty” in the summer as you can in the winter. (credit: Hector Alejandro, Flickr)')

<div class="title">
Calculating Thermal Expansion: Gas vs. Gas Tank
</div>
Suppose your 60.0-L (15.9-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas, so both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of  $$ 15.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy**

The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so
the amount spilled is the difference in their volume changes. (The gasoline tank
can be treated as solid steel.) We can use the equation for volume expansion to
calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank.

**Solution**

1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of
   the steel tank:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\Delta V}_{\text{s}}={\beta }_{\text{s}}{V}_{\text{s}}\Delta T. $$
</div>
2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\Delta V}_{\text{gas}}={\beta }_{\text{gas}}{V}_{\text{gas}}\Delta T. $$
</div>
3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as

<div class="equation" >
 $${V}_{\text{spill}}={\Delta V}_{\text{gas}}-{\Delta V}_{\text{s}}. $$
</div>
Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are equal.)

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{V}_{\text{spill}}& =& \left({\beta }_{\text{gas}}-{\beta }_{\text{s}}\right)V\Delta T\\ & =& \left[ \left(950-35\right) \times 10^{-6} /\text{ºC}\right]  \left( 60.0 \text{L}\right)\left( 20.0\text{ºC}\right)\\ & =&  1.10 \text{L}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so
striking because the gasoline and steel expand quickly. The rate of change in
thermal properties is discussed
in [Heat and Heat Transfer Methods](../contents/ch14HeatAndHeatTransfers).

If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it
leaks anyway, either around the cap or by bursting the tank. Tightly
constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids
and solids resist being compressed with extremely large forces. To avoid
rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps, which allow them to
expand and contract without stressing them.

</div>

### Thermal Stress

**Thermal stress** is created by thermal expansion or contraction (
see [Elasticity: Stress and Strain](../contents/ch5Elasticity) for a discussion of stress and
strain). Thermal stress can be destructive, such as when expanding gasoline
ruptures a tank. It can also be useful, for example, when two parts are joined
together by heating one in manufacturing, then slipping it over the other and
allowing the combination to cool. Thermal stress can explain many phenomena,
such as the weathering of rocks and pavement by the expansion of ice when it
freezes.

<div id="Example3" class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Thermal Stress: Gas Pressure
</div>
What pressure would be created in the gasoline tank considered in [[Example 2]](#Example2), if the gasoline increases in temperature from  $$ 15.0\text{ºC} $$
 to  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$
 without being allowed to expand? ** Assume that the bulk modulus  $$B $$
 for gasoline is  $$ 1.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ .
 (For more on bulk modulus, see [Elasticity: Stress and Strain](../contents/ch5Elasticity).)

**Strategy**

To solve this problem, we must use the following equation, which relates a
change in volume $$\Delta V $$ to pressure:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A}{V}_{0}, $$
</div>
where  $$F/A $$  is pressure,  $${V}_{0} $$
 is the original volume, and  $$B $$
 is the bulk modulus of the material involved. We will use the amount spilled in [[Example 2]](#Example2) as the change in volume,  $$\Delta V $$.

**Solution**

1. Rearrange the equation for calculating pressure:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\Delta V}{ {V}_{0}}B\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Insert the known values. The bulk modulus for gasoline is  $$B= 1.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ .
 In the previous example, the change in volume  $$\Delta V= 1.10 \text{L} $$
 is the amount that would spill. Here,  $${V}_{0}= 60.0 \text{L} $$
 is the original volume of the gasoline. Substituting these values into the equation, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1.10 \text{L}}{60.0 \text{L}}\left( 1.00 \times 10^{9}  \text{Pa}\right)= 1.83 \times 10^{7}  \text{Pa}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This pressure is about $$2500 {\text{lb/in}}^{2} $$ ,
_much_ more than a gasoline tank can handle.

</div>

Forces and pressures created by thermal stress are typically as great as that in
the example above. Railroad tracks and roadways can buckle on hot days if they
lack sufficient expansion joints. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) Power lines sag
more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is
insufficient slack. Cracks open and close in plaster walls as a house warms and
cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly, because of
differential contraction and the stresses it creates. (Pyrex® is less
susceptible because of its small coefficient of thermal expansion.) Nuclear
reactor pressure vessels are threatened by overly rapid cooling, and although
none have failed, several have been cooled faster than considered desirable.
Biological cells are ruptured when foods are frozen, detracting from their
taste. Repeated thawing and freezing accentuate the damage. Even the oceans can
be affected. A significant portion of the rise in sea level that is resulting
from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of sea water.

Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most
implants need to be replaced over time because, among other things, metal does
not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings that
would allow metal-to-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has
an expansion coefficient similar to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients
are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing process lead to
cracks at the coating-metal interface.

Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can
expand differently from tooth enamel. It can give pain when eating ice cream or
having a hot drink. Cracks might occur in the filling. Metal fillings (gold,
silver, etc.) are being replaced by composite fillings (porcelain), which have
smaller coefficients of expansion closer to those of teeth.

Two blocks, A and B, are made of the same material. Block A has dimensions  $$l×w×h=L×2L×L $$

<div class="solution"  data-print-placement="here" markdown="1">
(a) The change in volume is proportional to the original volume. Block A has a volume of  $$L×2L×L={2L}^{3}\text{.} $$  Block B has a volume of  $$2L×2L×2L={8L}^{3}, $$
 which is 4 times that of Block A. Thus the change in volume of Block B should be 4 times the change in volume of Block A.

Because cross-sectional area of Block B is twice that of Block A, the change

### Section Summary

* Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the size (length, area, or
  volume) of a body due to a change in temperature.
* Thermal expansion is large for gases, and relatively small, but not
  negligible, for liquids and solids.
* Linear thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\Delta L $$ is the change in length    $$L $$ ,
   $$\Delta T $$ is the change in temperature, and
   $$\alpha  $$ is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.
* The change in area due to thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta A=2\alpha A\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\Delta A $$ is the change in area.
* The change in volume due to thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta V=\beta V\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\beta  $$ is the coefficient of volume expansion and
   $$\beta \approx 3\alpha  $$ . Thermal stress is created when thermal expansion is constrained.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Thermal stresses caused by uneven cooling can easily break glass cookware. Explain why Pyrex®, a glass with a small coefficient of linear expansion, is less susceptible.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider how thermal stresses arise from uneven temperature distribution and how the coefficient of expansion affects these stresses.

**Solution:**
When glass cookware is cooled unevenly (for example, when hot cookware is placed on a cold surface), different parts of the glass are at different temperatures. The cooler parts contract more than the warmer parts, creating internal stresses.

Thermal stress is proportional to the coefficient of thermal expansion ($$\alpha$$). For ordinary glass, $$\alpha = 9 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$, while for Pyrex®, $$\alpha = 3 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$ (one-third as large).

When Pyrex® experiences the same temperature difference:
- It contracts three times less than ordinary glass
- The differential contraction between hot and cold regions is three times smaller
- The resulting thermal stresses are three times smaller
- The cookware is much less likely to exceed the breaking stress of the material

**Discussion:**
Pyrex® was specifically engineered for thermal shock resistance by using borosilicate glass, which has a much lower coefficient of thermal expansion than ordinary soda-lime glass. This makes it ideal for cookware that experiences rapid temperature changes, such as going from oven to countertop or from refrigerator to oven. However, even Pyrex® has limits and can break if subjected to extreme thermal shock or if there are manufacturing defects or scratches that concentrate stress.

Water expands significantly when it freezes: a volume increase of about 9% occurs. As a result of this expansion and because of the formation and growth of crystals as water freezes, anywhere from 10% to 30% of biological cells are burst when animal or plant material is frozen. Discuss the implications of this cell damage for the prospect of preserving human bodies by freezing so that they can be thawed at some future date when it is hoped that all diseases are curable.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the structural damage caused by ice crystal formation and volume expansion, and what this means for tissue integrity and function.

**Solution:**
The prospect of preserving human bodies by freezing (cryonics) faces severe challenges due to ice crystal formation:

1. **Cellular damage**: When 10-30% of cells burst during freezing, critical tissue structures are destroyed. This includes neurons in the brain, which cannot regenerate, potentially destroying memories and personality.

2. **Ice crystal damage**: Ice crystals that form between cells can physically tear cell membranes and damage the extracellular matrix that holds tissues together.

3. **Vascular damage**: Blood vessels would be particularly vulnerable, as their thin walls could be ruptured by ice expansion, making it impossible to restore blood circulation upon thawing.

4. **Organ structure**: Even if individual cells could be repaired, the overall architecture of organs and tissues would be compromised, making functional restoration extremely difficult or impossible.

5. **Information loss**: The brain's neural connections (synapses) that encode memories and personality might be physically disrupted by ice crystal formation, resulting in irreversible information loss.

**Discussion:**
Current cryonics procedures use cryoprotectants (antifreeze chemicals) to try to minimize ice formation, aiming for vitrification (glass-like solidification) rather than freezing. However, these chemicals are toxic and don't completely prevent ice formation in large organs. The fundamental challenge is that the damage from freezing is not merely a matter of preserving cell chemistry—it involves preserving the precise three-dimensional structure and connectivity of trillions of cells, which may be physically impossible with current or foreseeable technology.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
One method of getting a tight fit, say of a metal peg in a hole in a metal block, is to manufacture the peg slightly larger than the hole. The peg is then inserted when at a different temperature than the block. Should the block be hotter or colder than the peg during insertion? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider what needs to happen: either the peg must shrink or the hole must expand (or both) to allow insertion. Use thermal expansion principles.

**Solution:**
There are two viable approaches:

**Option 1: Heat the block (recommended)**
- Heating the block causes it to expand, including the hole
- The hole gets larger, allowing the oversized peg to fit
- When the block cools back to room temperature, it contracts, creating a very tight fit around the peg

**Option 2: Cool the peg**
- Cooling the peg causes it to contract and become smaller
- The peg can then fit into the hole
- When the peg warms back to room temperature, it expands, creating a tight fit

**Option 1 is generally preferred** because:
- Heating is usually easier than cooling
- The block can be heated uniformly
- The expanded hole provides clearance all around the peg

**Discussion:**
This technique, called interference fitting or shrink fitting, is commonly used in manufacturing and construction. Examples include fitting metal bands around wooden barrels (cooper's technique), mounting bearing races, and assembling railway wheels. The resulting joint can be extremely strong and doesn't require welding or fasteners. The same principle explains why it's easier to remove a stuck jar lid by running hot water over it—the metal lid expands more than the glass, loosening the fit.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Does it really help to run hot water over a tight metal lid on a glass jar before trying to open it? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Compare the thermal expansion of metal and glass when heated, and consider which expands more.

**Solution:**
Yes, running hot water over a tight metal lid really does help open it. Here's why:

From Table 1, typical coefficients of linear expansion are:
- Steel (for metal lid): $$\alpha = 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$
- Glass (ordinary): $$\alpha = 9 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

When hot water is applied:
1. Both the metal lid and glass jar expand
2. The metal lid expands more than the glass because it has a larger coefficient of expansion (12 vs. 9)
3. Additionally, the thin metal lid heats up faster than the thick glass jar, so it expands more quickly
4. The lid's circumference increases more than the jar's opening, loosening the fit

The differential expansion creates a small gap between the lid and jar, breaking the seal and reducing the friction that makes the lid difficult to turn.

**Discussion:**
This technique works best if you heat just the lid (not the whole jar), maximizing the temperature difference and thus the differential expansion. Some additional factors also help: heating can soften any sticky residue (like dried food) on the threads, and thermal expansion can release some of the vacuum seal that often forms in sealed jars. This is a practical example of how understanding thermal expansion can solve everyday problems.

Liquids and solids expand with increasing temperature, because the kinetic energy of a body's atoms and molecules increases. Explain why some materials *shrink* with increasing temperature.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider materials with special molecular structures or bonding arrangements that can change with temperature.

**Solution:**
Some materials have negative thermal expansion coefficients and shrink when heated due to their unique molecular or crystal structures:

1. **Water (4ºC to 0ºC)**: Water actually expands as it cools from 4ºC to 0ºC due to the formation of an open hexagonal crystal structure driven by hydrogen bonding. This structure has more empty space than liquid water, so cooling causes expansion in this range.

2. **Materials with flexible framework structures**: Some materials like zirconium tungstate (ZrW₂O₈) have crystal structures with flexible bridges or linkages between atoms. When heated, increased vibrations can cause these linkages to flex inward, pulling atoms closer together rather than pushing them apart, resulting in shrinkage.

3. **Materials with reorienting molecules**: In some materials, increasing temperature causes molecules or structural units to reorient themselves into more compact arrangements, leading to overall shrinkage.

4. **Composite materials**: Some engineered materials combine components with different expansion coefficients arranged so that the net effect is shrinkage with heating.

**Discussion:**
These materials with negative thermal expansion are relatively rare but scientifically important. They're useful for creating materials with zero net thermal expansion when combined with normally expanding materials, which is valuable for precision instruments, optical devices, and electronics that must maintain exact dimensions over temperature changes. The existence of negative thermal expansion shows that thermal expansion is not simply about increased atomic vibration—it depends critically on the specific bonding and structural arrangements in the material.

How much taller does the Eiffel Tower become at the end of a day when the temperature has increased by  $$15\text{ºC} $$ ?
 Its original height is 321 m and you can assume it is made of steel.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the linear thermal expansion equation $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T$$ with the coefficient of linear expansion for steel from Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, for steel: $$\alpha = 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

Given: $$L = 321 \text{ m}$$, $$\Delta T = 15\text{ºC}$$

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T=\left( 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left(321 \text{ m}\right)\left( 15\text{ºC}\right)= 0.058 \text{ m}= 5.8 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The Eiffel Tower grows by about 5.8 cm (nearly 2.3 inches) on a warm day. This is a significant amount and must be accounted for in the tower's design. The tower was built with expansion joints and the structure is designed to handle this thermal expansion without damage. Interestingly, the tower also leans slightly toward the sun on hot days because the side facing the sun heats up more and expands more than the shaded side, though this effect is small.

How large an expansion gap should be left between steel railroad rails if they may reach a maximum temperature  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$
 greater than when they were laid? Their original length is 10.0 m.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the linear thermal expansion equation to find how much each rail expands, then provide a gap at least this large.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, for steel: $$\alpha = 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

Given: $$L = 10.0 \text{ m}$$, $$\Delta T = 35.0\text{ºC}$$

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T=\left( 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left( 10.0 \text{ m}\right)\left( 35.0\text{ºC}\right)= 4.2 \times 10^{-3}  \text{ m}= 4.2 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

The expansion gap should be at least **4.2 mm** (about 0.17 inches).

**Discussion:**
This expansion gap is essential to prevent rails from buckling on hot days. If rails are constrained and cannot expand, enormous compressive stresses develop that can cause the rails to buckle sideways, creating a serious safety hazard. Modern continuous welded rail (CWR) reduces the number of gaps, but requires careful stress management. The familiar "clickety-clack" sound of older trains comes from wheels passing over these expansion joints. Temperature swings of 35ºC or more are common in many climates, making these gaps crucial for railroad safety.

Global warming will produce rising sea levels partly due to melting ice caps but also due to the expansion of water as average ocean temperatures rise. To get some idea of the size of this effect, calculate the change in length of a column of water 1.00 km high for a temperature increase of  $$ 1.00\text{ºC}\text{.} $$
 Note that this calculation is only approximate because ocean warming is not uniform with depth.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the volume (or linear) expansion formula. For a column of water, we can use $$\Delta L=\frac{\beta}{3}L\Delta T$$ or approximate using linear expansion.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, for water: $$\beta = 210 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

For a vertical column, the height change is:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\frac{\beta L\Delta T}{3}=\frac{\left( 210 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left(1000 \text{ m}\right)\left( 1.00\text{ºC}\right)}{3}= 0.070 \text{ m}= 7.0 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

Alternatively, we can say $$\Delta L \approx \beta L\Delta T/3$$, since for isotropic expansion, $$\beta \approx 3\alpha$$.

**Discussion:**
A 1ºC warming of a 1 km column of ocean water produces about 7 cm of sea level rise due to thermal expansion alone. The average ocean depth is about 3.7 km, so if the entire ocean warmed by 1ºC uniformly, thermal expansion would contribute roughly 26 cm (10 inches) to sea level rise. In reality, the warming is concentrated in the upper layers, but even partial ocean warming contributes significantly to sea level rise. Current estimates suggest that thermal expansion accounts for about 30-50% of observed sea level rise, with melting ice accounting for the remainder. This demonstrates that thermal expansion is a major contributor to climate change impacts.

 (b) Repeat the calculation for two 30.0-m-long surveyor's tapes.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Calculate the expansion of each material separately, then find the difference.

**Solution:**
From Table 1:
- Steel: $$\alpha_{\text{steel}} = 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$
- Invar: $$\alpha_{\text{invar}} = 0.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

(a) For 1.00 m sticks at $$\Delta T = 22.0\text{ºC}$$:

Steel expansion:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L_{\text{steel}}=\alpha_{\text{steel}} L\Delta T=\left( 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left( 1.00 \text{ m}\right)\left( 22.0\text{ºC}\right)= 2.64 \times 10^{-4}  \text{ m} $$
</div>

Invar expansion:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L_{\text{invar}}=\alpha_{\text{invar}} L\Delta T=\left( 0.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left( 1.00 \text{ m}\right)\left( 22.0\text{ºC}\right)= 1.98 \times 10^{-5}  \text{ m} $$
</div>

Difference:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L_{\text{steel}}-\Delta L_{\text{invar}}= 2.64 \times 10^{-4} - 1.98 \times 10^{-5}= 2.44 \times 10^{-4}  \text{ m}= 0.244 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

(b) For 30.0 m surveyor's tapes, the difference scales linearly:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Difference}= 30.0 \times 0.244 \text{ mm}= 7.3 \text{ mm}= 0.73 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
For a meter stick, the difference of 0.244 mm is small but measurable. However, for a 30-m surveyor's tape, the 7.3 mm (0.73 cm) difference is quite significant and could introduce substantial errors in surveying work if not accounted for. This is why Invar was developed—its extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion makes it ideal for precision instruments, surveying equipment, and scientific apparatus that must maintain accurate dimensions despite temperature changes. Invar's name comes from "invariable," reflecting its dimensional stability.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Calculate the volume expansion of both the radiator (copper) and the fluid. The overflow is the difference between the fluid expansion and the radiator expansion.

**Solution:**
From Table 1: $$\beta_{\text{copper}} = 51 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

Given: $$\beta_{\text{fluid}} = 400 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$, $$V = 16.0 \text{ L}$$, $$\Delta T = 95.0\text{ºC} - 10.0\text{ºC} = 85.0\text{ºC}$$

Fluid expansion:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V_{\text{fluid}}=\beta_{\text{fluid}} V\Delta T=\left( 400 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}\right)\left( 16.0 \text{ L}\right)\left( 85.0\text{ºC}\right)= 0.544 \text{ L} $$

Volume that overflows:
<div class="equation" >
 $${V}_{\text{overflow}}=\Delta V_{\text{fluid}}-\Delta V_{\text{radiator}}= 0.544 \text{ L}- 0.069 \text{ L}= 0.48 \text{ L} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
About 0.48 L (roughly half a liter or one pint) of coolant will overflow, which is why radiator overflow reservoirs are necessary. The fluid expands much more than the copper radiator (coefficient nearly 8 times larger), so the net effect is significant overflow. Modern cooling systems are designed as closed systems with expansion tanks that can accommodate this volume change, preventing coolant loss and allowing the fluid to return to the radiator when the engine cools. Without such a reservoir, coolant would be lost every time the engine heats up, requiring frequent refilling.

(b) This enormous pressure (about 2000 atmospheres or 29,000 psi) far exceeds what biological cell membranes can withstand. Cell membranes typically rupture at pressures of just a few atmospheres. This explains why:
- Freezing bursts 10-30% of cells
- Frozen foods have different texture when thawed
- Frostbite causes permanent tissue damage
- Cryopreservation requires cryoprotectants to minimize ice formation

**Discussion:**
The tremendous pressure generated by freezing water is why water pipes burst in winter and why rocks can be fractured by freeze-thaw cycles (frost wedging). This pressure is also why it's so dangerous to freeze liquids in sealed containers—they can explode. For biological preservation, this demonstrates why simple freezing is inadequate and why advanced cryopreservation techniques attempt to achieve vitrification (glass-like solidification) rather than ice crystal formation.

Show that  $$\beta \approx 3\alpha , $$
 by calculating the change in volume  $$\Delta V $$
 of a cube with sides of length  $$L\text{.} $$
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
We know how the length changes with temperature:  $$\Delta L=\alpha L_{0}\Delta T $$ .
 Also we know that the volume of a cube is related to its length by  $$V={L}^{3} $$ ,
 so the final volume is then  $$V={V}_{0}+\Delta V={\left({L}_{0}+\Delta L\right)}^{3} $$ .
 Substituting for  $$\Delta L $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$V={\left({L}_{0}+\alpha L_{0}\Delta T\right)}^{3}={L}_{0}^{3}{\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right)}^{3}\text{.} $$
</div>
Now, because  $$\alpha \Delta T $$
 is small, we can use the binomial expansion:

<div class="equation"  data-element-type="problems-exercises">
 $$V\approx {L}_{0}^{3}\left(1+3\alpha \Delta T\right)={L}_{0}^{3}+3\alpha {L}_{0}^{3}\Delta T. $$
</div>
So writing the length terms in terms of volumes gives  $$V={V}_{0}+\Delta V\approx {V}_{0}+{3\alpha V}_{0}\Delta T, $$
 and so

<div class="equation"  data-element-type="problems-exercises">
 $$\Delta V=\beta V_{0}\Delta T\approx {3\alpha V}_{0}\Delta T, \text{ or } \beta \approx 3\alpha . $$
</div>
</div>
