We now move from consideration of forces that affect the motion of an object (
such as friction and drag) to those that affect an object’s shape. If a
bulldozer pushes a car into a wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably
change shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a
**deformation**. Even very small forces are known to cause some deformation. For
small deformations, two important characteristics are observed. First, the
object returns to its original shape when the force is removed—that is, the
deformation is elastic for small deformations. Second, the size of the
deformation is proportional to the force—that is, for small deformations,
Hooke’s law is obeyed. In equation form, **Hooke’s law** is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ F=k\Delta L, $$
</div>

where $$ \Delta L $$ is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for
example) produced by the force $$ F $$, and $$ k $$ is a proportionality
constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object and the
direction of the force. Note that this force is a function of the deformation $$
\Delta L $$ —it is not constant as a kinetic friction force is. Rearranging this
to

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta L=\frac{F}{k} $$
</div>

makes it clear that the deformation is proportional to the applied
force. [Figure 1](#Figure1) shows the Hooke’s law relationship between the
extension $$ \Delta L $$ of a spring or of a human bone. For metals or springs,
the straight line region in which Hooke’s law pertains is much larger. Bones are
brittle and the elastic region is small and the fracture abrupt. Eventually a
large enough stress to the material will cause it to break or fracture. 
**Tensile strength** is the breaking stress that will cause permanent deformation
or fracture of a material.

{: #Figure1}

The proportionality constant $$ k $$ depends upon a number of factors for the
material. For example, a guitar string made of nylon stretches when it is
tightened, and the elongation $$ \Delta L $$ is proportional to the force
applied (at least for small deformations). Thicker nylon strings and ones made
of steel stretch less for the same applied force, implying they have a larger $$
k $$
(see [Figure 2](#Figure2)). Finally, all three strings return to their normal
lengths when the force is removed, provided the deformation is small. Most
materials will behave in this manner if the deformation is less than about 0.1%
or about 1 part in $$ 10^{3} $$.

![Diagram of weight w attached to each of three guitar strings of initial length L zero hanging vertically from a ceiling. The weight pulls down on the strings with force w. The ceiling pulls up on the strings with force w. The first string of thin nylon has a deformation of delta L due to the force of the weight pulling down. The middle string of thicker nylon has a smaller deformation. The third string of thin steel has the smallest deformation.](../resources/Figure_05_03_02.jpg "The same force, in this case a weight ( \( w \) ), applied to three different guitar strings of identical length produces the three different deformations shown as shaded segments.

Stretch Yourself a Little
</div>
How would you go about measuring the proportionality constant $$ k $$ of a rubber band? If a rubber band stretched 3 cm when a 100-g mass was attached
to it, then how much would it stretch if two similar rubber bands were attached
to the same mass—even if put together in parallel or alternatively if tied
together in series?

</div>

We now consider three specific types of deformations: changes in length (tension
and compression), sideways shear (
stress), and changes in volume. All deformations are assumed to be small unless
otherwise stated.

### Changes in Length—Tension and Compression: Elastic Modulus

A change in length $$ \Delta L $$ is produced when a force is applied to a wire
or rod parallel to its length $$ L_{0} $$, either stretching it (a tension) or
compressing it. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).)

![Figure a is a cylindrical rod standing on its end with a height of L sub zero. Two vectors labeled F extend away from each end. A dotted outline indicates that the rod is stretched by a length of delta L. Figure b is a similar rod of identical height L sub zero, but two vectors labeled F exert a force toward the ends of the rod. A dotted line indicates that the rod is compressed by a length of delta L.](../resources/Figure_05_03_03.jpg "(a) Tension. The rod is stretched a length \( \Delta L \) when a force is applied parallel to its length. (b) Compression. The same rod is compressed by forces with the same magnitude in the opposite direction. For very small deformations and uniform materials, \( \Delta L \) is approximately the same for the same magnitude of tension or compression. For larger deformations, the cross-sectional area changes as the rod is compressed or stretched.")
{: #Figure3}

Experiments have shown that the change in length ( $$ \Delta L $$)
depends on only a few variables. As already noted, $$ \Delta L $$ is
proportional to the force $$ F $$ and depends on the substance from which the
object is made. Additionally, the change in length is proportional to the
original length $$ L_{0} $$ and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional
area of the wire or rod. For example, a long guitar string will stretch more
than a short one, and a thick string will stretch less than a thin one. We can
combine all these factors into one equation for $$ \Delta L $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ \Delta L $$ is the change in length, $$ F $$ the applied force, $$ Y $$
is a factor, called the elastic modulus or Young’s modulus, that depends on the
substance, $$ A $$ is the cross-sectional area, and $$ L_{0} $$ is the original
length. [Table 1](#Table1) lists values of $$ Y$$ for several materials—those
with a large $$ Y $$ are said to have a large tensile stiffness because they
deform less for a given tension or compression.

[^1]: Footnote: Approximate and average values. Young’s moduli $$ Y $$ for
tension and compression sometimes differ but are averaged here. Bone has
significantly different Young’s moduli for tension and compression.

Young’s moduli are not listed for liquids and gases in [Table 1](#Table1)
because they cannot be stretched or compressed in only one direction. Note that
there is an assumption that the object does not accelerate, so that there are
actually two applied forces of magnitude $$ F $$ acting in opposite directions.
For example, the strings in [Figure 3](#Figure3) are being pulled down by a force
of magnitude $$ w $$ and held up by the ceiling, which also exerts a force of
magnitude $$ w $$.

The Stretch of a Long Cable
</div>
Suspension cables are used to carry gondolas at ski resorts. (See [Figure 4](#Figure4)) Consider a suspension cable that includes an unsupported span of 3020 m. Calculate the amount of stretch in the steel cable. Assume that the cable has a diameter of 5.6 cm and the maximum tension it can withstand is $$ 3.0\times 10^{6}\N $$.

![Ski gondolas travel along suspension cables. A vast forest and snowy mountain peaks can be seen in the background.](../resources/Figure_05_03_04.jpg "Gondolas travel along suspension cables at the Gala Yuzawa ski resort in Japan. (credit: Rudy Herman, Flickr)")
{: #Figure4}

**Strategy**

The force is equal to the maximum tension, or $$ F=3.0\times 10^{6}\N $$. The
cross-sectional area is $$ \pi r^{2}=2.46 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$. The equation $$
\Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$ can be used to find the change in
length.

**Solution**

All quantities are known. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta L&=& \left(\frac{1}{210 \times 10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{3.0\times 10^{6}\N }{2.46\times 10^{-3} \mm}\right)\left(3020 \m \right)\\
\Delta L&=& 18 \m .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is quite a stretch, but only about 0.6% of the unsupported length. Effects
of temperature upon length might be important in these environments.

</div>

Bones, on the whole, do not fracture due to tension or compression. Rather they
generally fracture due to sideways impact or bending, resulting in the bone
shearing or snapping. The behavior of bones under tension and compression is
important because it determines the load the bones can carry. Bones are
classified as weight-bearing structures such as columns in buildings and trees.
Weight-bearing structures have special features; columns in building have
steel-reinforcing rods while trees and bones are fibrous. The bones in different
parts of the body serve different structural functions and are prone to
different stresses. Thus the bone in the top of the femur is arranged in thin
sheets separated by marrow while in other places the bones can be cylindrical
and filled with marrow or just solid. Overweight people have a tendency toward
bone damage due to sustained compressions in bone joints and tendons.

Another biological example of Hooke’s law occurs in tendons. Functionally, the
tendon (the tissue connecting muscle to bone) must stretch easily at first when
a force is applied, but offer a much greater restoring force for a greater
strain. [Figure 5](#Figure5) shows a stress-strain relationship for a human tendon.
Some tendons have a high collagen content so there is relatively little strain,
or length change; others, like support tendons (as in the leg) can change length
up to 10%. Note that this stress-strain curve is nonlinear, since the slope of
the line changes in different regions. In the first part of the stretch called
the toe region, the fibers in the tendon begin to align in the direction of the
stress—this is called *uncrimping*. In the linear region, the fibrils will be
stretched, and in the failure region individual fibers begin to break. A simple
model of this relationship can be illustrated by springs in parallel: different
springs are activated at different lengths of stretch. Examples of this are
given in the problems at end of this chapter. Ligaments (tissue connecting bone
to bone)
behave in a similar way.

![The strain on mammalian tendon is shown by a graph, with strain along the x axis and tensile stress along the y axis. The stress strain curve obtained has three regions, namely, toe region at the bottom, linear region between, and failure region at the top.](../resources/Figure_05_03_05.jpg "Typical stress-strain curve for mammalian tendon. Three regions are shown: (1) toe region (2) linear region, and (3) failure region.")
{: #Figure5}

Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic, the
arteries and lungs need to be very stretchable. The elastic properties of the
arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in the arteries increases
and arterial walls stretch when the blood is pumped out of the heart. When the
aortic valve shuts, the pressure in the arteries drops and the arterial walls
relax to maintain the blood flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling
exactly this—the elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through
with each pump of the heart. If the arteries were rigid, you would not feel a
pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The lungs
expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely and elastically
when we breathe out. Our skins are particularly elastic, especially for the
young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg with no visible sag in their
skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces with age. Gradual physiological
aging through reduction in elasticity starts in the early 20s.

Calculating Deformation: How Much Does Your Leg Shorten When You Stand on It?
</div>
Calculate the change in length of the upper leg bone (the femur) when a 70.0 kg
man supports 62.0 kg of his mass on it, assuming the bone to be equivalent to a
uniform rod that is 40.0 cm long and 2.00 cm in radius.

**Strategy**

The force is equal to the weight supported, or

<div class="equation">
 $$ F=mg =\left(62.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)=607.6 \N , $$
</div>
and the cross-sectional area is $$ \pi r^{2}=1.257 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$. The equation $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$
can be used to find the change in length.

**Solution**

All quantities except $$ \Delta L $$ are known. Note that the compression value
for Young’s modulus for bone must be used here. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta L&=& \left(\frac{1}{9\times 10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{607.6 \N }{1.257\times 10^{-3} \mm}\right)\left(0.400 \m \right)\\
\Delta L&=& 2\times 10^{-5}\m .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This small change in length seems reasonable, consistent with our experience
that bones are rigid. In fact, even the rather large forces encountered during
strenuous physical activity do not compress or bend bones by large amounts.
Although bone is rigid compared with fat or muscle, several of the substances
listed in [Table 1](#Table1) have larger values of Young’s modulus $$ Y $$. In
other words, they are more rigid.

</div>

The equation for change in length is traditionally rearranged and written in the
following form:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{F}{A}=Y\frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}}. $$
</div>

The ratio of force to area, $$ \frac{F}{A} $$, is defined as **stress** (
measured in $$ \text{N/m}^{2} $$ ), and the ratio of the change in length to
length, $$ \frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}} $$, is defined as
**strain**
(a unitless quantity). In other words,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{stress}=Y \times \text{strain}. $$
</div>

In this form, the equation is analogous to Hooke’s law, with stress analogous to
force and strain analogous to deformation. If we again rearrange this equation
to the form

<div class="equation">
 $$ F= Y A \frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}}, $$
</div>

we see that it is the same as Hooke’s law with a proportionality constant

<div class="equation">
 $$ k=\frac{ Y A}{ L_{0}}. $$
</div>

This general idea—that force and the deformation it causes are proportional for
small deformations—applies to changes in length, sideways bending, and changes
in volume.

### Sideways Stress: Shear Modulus

[Figure 6](#Figure6) illustrates what is meant by a sideways stress or a *shearing
force*. Here the deformation is called $$ \Delta x $$ and it is perpendicular to
$$ L_{0} $$, rather than parallel as with tension and compression. Shear
deformation behaves similarly to tension and compression and can be described
with similar equations. The expression for
**shear deformation** is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ S $$ is the shear modulus (
see [Table 1](#Table1)) and $$ F $$ is the force applied perpendicular to $$ L_
{0} $$ and parallel to the cross-sectional area $$ A $$. Again, to keep the
object from accelerating, there are actually two equal and opposite forces $$ F
$$ applied across opposite faces, as illustrated in [Figure 6](#Figure6). The
equation is logical—for example, it is easier to bend a long thin pencil (small
$$ A $$ )
than a short thick one, and both are more easily bent than similar steel rods (
large $$ S $$ ).

and parallel to the cross-sectional area $$ A $$.

</div>

![Bookcase sheared by a force applied at the bottom right toward the bottom left, and at the top left toward the top right.](../resources/Figure_05_03_06.jpg "Shearing forces are applied perpendicular to the length \( L_0 \) and parallel to the area \( A \), producing a deformation \( \Delta x \). Vertical forces are not shown, but it should be kept in mind that in addition to the two shearing forces, \( F \) , there must be supporting forces to keep the object from rotating. The distorting effects of these supporting forces are ignored in this treatment. The weight of the object also is not shown, since it is usually negligible compared with forces large enough to cause significant deformations.")
{: #Figure6}

Examination of the shear moduli in [Table 1](#Table1)
reveals some telling patterns. For example, shear moduli are less than Young’s
moduli for most materials. Bone is a remarkable exception. Its shear modulus is
not only greater than its Young’s modulus, but it is as large as that of steel.
This is why bones are so rigid.

The spinal column (consisting of 26 vertebral segments separated by discs)
provides the main support for the head and upper part of the body. The spinal
column has normal curvature for stability, but this curvature can be increased,
leading to increased shearing forces on the lower vertebrae. Discs are better at
withstanding compressional forces than shear forces. Because the spine is not
vertical, the weight of the upper body exerts some of both. Pregnant women and
people that are overweight (with large abdomens) need to move their shoulders
back to maintain balance, thereby increasing the curvature in their spine and so
increasing the shear component of the stress. An increased angle due to more
curvature increases the shear forces along the plane. These higher shear forces
increase the risk of back injury through ruptured discs. The lumbosacral disc (
the wedge shaped disc below the last vertebrae) is particularly at risk because
of its location.

The shear moduli for concrete and brick are very small; they are too highly
variable to be listed. Concrete used in buildings can withstand compression, as
in pillars and arches, but is very poor against shear, as might be encountered
in heavily loaded floors or during earthquakes. Modern structures were made
possible by the use of steel and steel-reinforced concrete. Almost by
definition, liquids and gases have shear moduli near zero, because they flow in
response to shearing forces.

Calculating Force Required to Deform: That Nail Does Not Bend Much Under a Load
</div>
Find the mass of the picture hanging from a steel nail as shown in [Figure 7](#Figure7),
given that the nail bends only $$ 1.80\times 10^{-6} \m $$. (Assume the shear
modulus is known to two significant figures.)

![Diagram showing the side view a nail in a wall, deformed by the weight of a picture hanging from it. The weight w of the picture is downward. There is an equal force w upward on the nail from the wall. The nail is 1 point five zero millimeters thick. The length of the nail that is outside the wall is five point zero zero millimeters. The deformation delta x of the nail as a result of the picture is 1 point eight zero micrometers.](../resources/Figure_05_03_08.jpg "Side view of a nail with a picture hung from it. The nail flexes very slightly (shown much larger than actual) because of the shearing effect of the supported weight. Also shown is the upward force of the wall on the nail, illustrating that there are equal and opposite forces applied across opposite cross sections of the nail.")
{: #Figure7}

**Strategy**

The force $$ F $$ on the nail (neglecting the nail’s own weight) is the weight
of the picture $$ w $$. If we can find $$ w $$, then the mass of the picture is
just $$ \frac{w}{g} $$. The equation $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$
can be solved for $$ F $$.

**Solution**

Solving the equation $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$ for $$ F $$, we
see that all other quantities can be found:

<div class="equation">
 $$ F= \frac{S A}{L_{0}} \Delta x. $$
</div>
*S* is found in [Table 1](#Table1) and is
$$ S=80 \times 10^{9} \text{N/m}^{2} $$. The radius $$ r $$
is 0.750 mm (as seen in the figure), so the cross-sectional area is

<div class="equation">
 $$ A=\pi r^{2}=1.77 \times 10^{-6} \mm. $$
</div>
The value for $$ L_{0} $$ is also shown in the figure. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ F=\frac{ \left(80 \times 10^{9} \text{N/m}^{2}\right)\left(1.77 \times 10^{-6} \mm\right)}{\left(5.00 \times 10^{-3}\m \right)}\left(1.80 \times 10^{-6}\m \right)=51 \N . $$
</div>
This 51 N force is the weight $$ w $$ of the picture, so the picture’s mass is

<div class="equation">
 $$ m=\frac{w}{g}=\frac{F}{g}=5.2 \kg . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is a fairly massive picture, and it is impressive that the nail flexes only
$$ 1.80\times 10^{-6} \m $$ —an amount undetectable to the unaided eye.

</div>

### Changes in Volume: Bulk Modulus

An object will be compressed in all directions if inward forces are applied
evenly on all its surfaces as in [Figure 8](#Figure8). It is relatively easy to
compress gases and extremely difficult to compress liquids and solids. For
example, air in a wine bottle is compressed when it is corked. But if you try
corking a brim-full bottle, you cannot compress the wine—some must be removed if
the cork is to be inserted. The reason for these different compressibilities is
that atoms and molecules are separated by large empty spaces in gases but packed
close together in liquids and solids. To compress a gas, you must force its
atoms and molecules closer together. To compress liquids and solids, you must
actually compress their atoms and molecules, and very strong electromagnetic
forces in them oppose this compression.

![A cube with area of cross section A and volume V zero is compressed by an inward force F acting on all surfaces. The compression causes a change in volume delta V, which is proportional to the force per unit area and its original volume. This change in volume is related to the compressibility of the substance.](../resources/Figure_05_03_09.jpg "An inward force on all surfaces compresses this cube. Its change in volume is proportional to the force per unit area and its original volume, and is related to the compressibility of the substance.")
{: #Figure8}

We can describe the compression or volume deformation of an object with an
equation. First, we note that a force “applied evenly” is defined to have the
same stress, or ratio of force to area $$ \frac{F}{A} $$ on all surfaces. The
deformation produced is a change in volume $$ \Delta V $$, which is found to
behave very similarly to the shear, tension, and compression previously
discussed. (This is not surprising, since a compression of the entire object is
equivalent to compressing each of its three dimensions.) The relationship of the
change in volume to other physical quantities is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A} V_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ B $$ is the bulk modulus (see [Table 1](#Table1)), $$ V_{0} $$ is the
original volume, and $$ \frac{F}{A} $$ is the force per unit area applied
uniformly inward on all surfaces. Note that no bulk moduli are given for gases.

What are some examples of bulk compression of solids and liquids? One practical
example is the manufacture of industrial-grade diamonds by compressing carbon
with an extremely large force per unit area. The carbon atoms rearrange their
crystalline structure into the more tightly packed pattern of diamonds. In
nature, a similar process occurs deep underground, where extremely large forces
result from the weight of overlying material. Another natural source of large
compressive forces is the pressure created by the weight of water, especially in
deep parts of the oceans. Water exerts an inward force on all surfaces of a
submerged object, and even on the water itself. At great depths, water is
measurably compressed, as the following example illustrates.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Change in Volume with Deformation: How Much Is Water Compressed at Great Ocean Depths?
</div>
Calculate the fractional decrease in volume ( $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}} $$ )
for seawater at 5.00 km depth, where the force per unit area is $$ 5.00 \times
10^{7} \N/ \mm $$.

**Strategy**

Equation $$ \Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A} V_{0} $$ is the correct physical
relationship. All quantities in the equation except $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}}
$$ are known.

**Solution**

Solving for the unknown $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}} $$ gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}}=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A}. $$
</div>
Substituting known values with the value for the bulk modulus
$$ B $$ from [Table 1](#Table1),

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\frac{ \Delta V}{ V_0}&=& \frac{5.00\times 10^{7} \N/\mm }{2.2\times 10^{9} \N/\mm} \\
\frac{ \Delta V}{ V_0}&=& 0.023=2.3%.
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Although measurable, this is not a significant decrease in volume considering
that the force per unit area is about 500 atmospheres (1 million pounds per
square foot). Liquids and solids are extraordinarily difficult to compress.

</div>

Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to
expand but are constrained from doing so—which is equivalent to compressing them
to less than their normal volume. This often occurs when a contained material
warms up, since most materials expand when their temperature increases. If the
materials are tightly constrained, they deform or break their container. Another
very common example occurs when water freezes. Water, unlike most materials,
expands when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a
biological cell, or crack an engine block that gets in its way.

Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave analogously to
the tension, shear, and bulk deformations considered here.

### Section Summary

* Hooke’s law is given by
  <div class="equation">
  $$ F=k\Delta L, $$
  </div>

where $$ \Delta L $$ is the amount of deformation (the change in length), $$ F
$$ is the applied force, and $$ k $$ is a proportionality constant that depends
on the shape and composition of the object and the direction of the force. The
relationship between the deformation and the applied force can also be written
as

  <div class="equation">
  $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
  </div>

where $$ Y $$ is *Young’s modulus*, which depends on the substance, $$ A $$ is
the cross-sectional area, and $$ L_{0} $$ is the original length.

* The ratio of force to area, $$ \frac{F}{A} $$, is defined as *stress*,
  measured in $$\text{N/m}^2$$.
* The ratio of the change in length to length, $$ \frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}} $$,
  is defined as *strain* (a unitless quantity). In other words,
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \text{stress}=Y \times \text{strain}. $$
  </div>

* The expression for shear deformation is
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
  </div>

where $$ S $$ is the shear modulus and $$ F $$ is the force applied
perpendicular to $$ L_{0} $$ and parallel to the cross-sectional area $$ A $$.

* The relationship of the change in volume to other physical quantities is given
  by
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A} V_{0}, $$
  </div>

where $$ B $$ is the bulk modulus, $$ V_{0} $$ is the original volume, and $$
\frac{ F}{A} $$ is the force per unit area applied uniformly inward on all
surfaces.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
During a circus act, one performer swings upside down hanging from a trapeze
holding another, also upside-down, performer by the legs. If the upward force on
the lower performer is three times her weight, how much do the bones (the femurs)
in her upper legs stretch? You may assume each is equivalent to a uniform
rod 35.0 cm long and 1.80 cm in radius. Her mass is 60.0 kg.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$, where $$ F $$ is the tensile force, $$ L_0 $$ is the original length, $$ A $$ is the cross-sectional area, and $$ Y $$ is Young's modulus. From Table 3, Young's modulus for bone is $$ Y = 1.6 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$. The total force of 3 times her weight is distributed between two femurs.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the total upward force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = 3mg = 3(60.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 1764 \N $$
</div>

2. Force on each femur (two femurs share the load):
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{1764 \N}{2} = 882 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the cross-sectional area of each femur:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0180 \m)^2 = 1.018 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$
</div>

4. Apply the stretch formula:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} = \frac{(882 \N)(0.350 \m)}{(1.018 \times 10^{-3} \mm)(1.6 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{308.7}{1.629 \times 10^{7}} = 1.90 \times 10^{-5} \m = 1.90 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Each femur stretches by $$ 1.90 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm} $$ or about $$ 19 \text{ μm} $$. This very small stretch (less than the width of a human hair) demonstrates the remarkable stiffness of bone. Even under a load of three times body weight, the femur stretches by only about 0.005% of its length, which is well within the elastic limit and causes no damage.

During a wrestling match, a 150 kg wrestler briefly stands on one hand during a
maneuver designed to perplex his already moribund adversary. By how much does
the upper arm bone shorten in length? The bone can be represented by a uniform
rod 38.0 cm in length and 2.10 cm in radius.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The upper arm bone (humerus) is under compression from supporting the wrestler's weight. We use $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$, where $$ F = mg $$ is the compressive force (the wrestler's weight), and Young's modulus for bone is $$ Y = 1.6 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the compressive force (wrestler's weight):
<div class="equation">
$$ F = mg = (150 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 1470 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the bone:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0210 \m)^2 = 1.385 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$
</div>

3. Calculate the compression:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} = \frac{(1470 \N)(0.380 \m)}{(1.385 \times 10^{-3} \mm)(1.6 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{558.6}{2.216 \times 10^{7}} = 2.52 \times 10^{-5} \m = 0.0252 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The upper arm bone shortens by $$ 0.0252 \text{ mm} $$ or about $$ 25 \text{ μm} $$, which is less than 0.01% of its length. Despite supporting the full weight of a 150-kg wrestler, the bone compression is minuscule, demonstrating bone's excellent compressive strength. This is well within the elastic limit—the bone returns to its original length as soon as the wrestler shifts position.

(a) The "lead" in pencils is a graphite composition with a Young's modulus of
about $$ 1\times 10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2} $$. Calculate the change in length of the
lead in an automatic pencil if you tap it straight into the pencil with a force
of 4.0 N. The lead is 0.50 mm in diameter and 60 mm long.
(b) Is the answer reasonable? That is, does it seem to
be consistent with what you have observed when using pencils?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the deformation formula $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$. The force is applied along the length of the lead, causing compression. Given values: $$ F = 4.0 \N $$, $$ L_0 = 60 \text{ mm} = 0.060 \m $$, diameter $$ = 0.50 \text{ mm} $$, and $$ Y = 1 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the compression:

1. Find the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.25 \times 10^{-3} \m)^2 = 1.96 \times 10^{-7} \mm $$
</div>

2. Calculate the compression:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} = \frac{(4.0 \N)(0.060 \m)}{(1.96 \times 10^{-7} \mm)(1 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{0.24}{196} = 1.22 \times 10^{-3} \m \approx 1 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

(b) Reasonableness check:

A compression of about 1 mm is approximately 1.7% of the original 60 mm length. This does seem reasonable based on everyday experience—when you tap a mechanical pencil lead against a surface, you can see it compress slightly before it advances into the pencil mechanism.

**Discussion**

The pencil lead compresses by approximately $$ 1 \text{ mm} $$ under a 4.0 N force. This relatively large deformation (compared to metals or bone) reflects the low Young's modulus of graphite ($$ 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$), which is about 200 times less stiff than steel. This softness is why pencil lead can mark paper and also why it breaks relatively easily if bent.

TV broadcast antennas are the tallest artificial structures on Earth. In 1987,
a 72.0-kg physicist placed himself and 400 kg of equipment at the top of one
610-m high antenna to perform gravity experiments. By how much was the antenna
compressed, if we consider it to be equivalent to a steel cylinder 0.150 m in radius?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$ to find the compression. The force is the total weight of the physicist and equipment. For steel, Young's modulus is $$ Y = 2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2 $$ from Table 3.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the total weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = (m_{\text{physicist}} + m_{\text{equipment}})g = (72.0 \kg + 400 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 4626 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.150 \m)^2 = 0.0707 \mm $$
</div>

3. Calculate the compression:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} = \frac{(4626 \N)(610 \m)}{(0.0707 \mm)(2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{2.82 \times 10^6}{1.48 \times 10^{10}} = 1.90 \times 10^{-4} \m = 0.190 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The antenna is compressed by only $$ 0.19 \text{ mm} $$ despite the 610-m height and nearly 500-kg load at the top. This tiny compression (about 0.00003% of the antenna's length) demonstrates steel's exceptional stiffness. The antenna's structural integrity is clearly not compromised by this additional load, which explains why such experiments are feasible.

(a) By how much does a 65.0-kg mountain climber stretch her 0.800-cm diameter
nylon rope when she hangs 35.0 m below a rock outcropping?
(b) Does the answer seem to be consistent with what you have observed for
nylon ropes? Would it make sense if the rope were actually a bungee cord?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$ to find how much the rope stretches under the climber's weight. From Table 3, Young's modulus for nylon is $$ Y = 5 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the rope stretch:

1. Calculate the weight (tension in rope):
<div class="equation">
$$ F = mg = (65.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 637 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.00400 \m)^2 = 5.03 \times 10^{-5} \mm $$
</div>

3. Calculate the stretch:

$$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} = \frac{(637 \N)(35.0 \m)}{(5.03 \times 10^{-5} \mm)(5 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{22295}{2.515 \times 10^5} = 0.089 \m \approx 9 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

(b) Reasonableness check:

A stretch of 9 cm for a 35-m rope is about 0.26% stretch, which is reasonable for nylon climbing rope. Climbing ropes are designed to have some stretch to absorb the energy of a fall, but not too much. If this were a bungee cord (which has Young's modulus about 100 times lower than nylon), the stretch would be about 9 meters—which would indeed be expected for bungee jumping!

**Discussion**

The nylon rope stretches by approximately $$ 9 \text{ cm} $$ under the climber's weight. This moderate stretch is a key safety feature of climbing ropes—they're elastic enough to absorb shock from falls but stiff enough to not stretch excessively during normal use. A bungee cord, by contrast, would stretch several meters, which would be dangerous for climbing but essential for bungee jumping.

A 20.0-m tall hollow aluminum flagpole is equivalent in stiffness to a solid
cylinder 4.00 cm in diameter. A strong wind bends the pole much as a horizontal
force of 900 N exerted at the top would. How far to the side does the top of
the pole flex?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is a bending problem, where a horizontal force at the top causes the pole to flex sideways. For a cantilever beam (fixed at one end, force at the other), the deflection is given by $$ \delta = \frac{FL^3}{3YI} $$, where $$ I = \frac{\pi r^4}{4} $$ is the moment of inertia for a circular cross-section. From Table 3, Young's modulus for aluminum is $$ Y = 7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the moment of inertia:
<div class="equation">
$$ I = \frac{\pi r^4}{4} = \frac{\pi(0.0200 \m)^4}{4} = 1.257 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^4 $$
</div>

2. Calculate the deflection:
<div class="equation">
$$ \delta = \frac{FL^3}{3YI} = \frac{(900 \N)(20.0 \m)^3}{3(7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)(1.257 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^4)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \delta = \frac{(900)(8000)}{3(7.0 \times 10^{10})(1.257 \times 10^{-7})} = \frac{7.2 \times 10^6}{2.64 \times 10^4} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \delta = 273 \m $$
</div>

This result seems too large. Let me reconsider—perhaps we should use the shear deformation approach instead:

Using shear: $$ \Delta x = \frac{FL}{AS} $$, where $$ S $$ is the shear modulus. For aluminum, $$ S = 2.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0200)^2 = 1.257 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{(900 \N)(20.0 \m)}{(1.257 \times 10^{-3} \mm)(2.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} = \frac{18000}{3.14 \times 10^7} = 5.7 \times 10^{-4} \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The top of the flagpole flexes approximately $$ 0.57 \text{ mm} $$ to the side under the 900 N horizontal wind force. This small deflection shows that even relatively thin aluminum poles are quite stiff against bending. In practice, flagpoles are designed to handle much larger wind loads without significant permanent deformation.

As an oil well is drilled, each new section of drill pipe supports its own

a new 6.00 m length of steel pipe that supports 3.00 km of pipe having a mass
of 20.0 kg/m and a 100-kg drill bit. The pipe is equivalent in stiffness to a
solid cylinder 5.00 cm in diameter.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The top section of pipe must support the weight of all the pipe below it plus the drill bit. We use $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$. For steel, Young's modulus is $$ Y = 2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the total mass supported:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{pipe}} + m_{\text{bit}} = (20.0 \text{ kg/m})(3000 \m) + 100 \kg = 60000 \kg + 100 \kg = 60100 \kg $$

The 6-meter section of drill pipe stretches by $$ 8.59 \text{ mm} $$ while supporting 3 km of pipe and a drill bit. This represents a strain of about 0.14%, which is within steel's elastic limit.

We rearrange $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$ to solve for force: $$ F = \frac{\Delta L \cdot A \cdot Y}{L_0} $$. For steel, Young's modulus is $$ Y = 2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area:

The intervertebral disk experiences a shear deformation of $$ 3.34 \text{ μm} $$.

We decompose the force and apply the appropriate deformation formulas. For hardwood (like in a pencil), $$ Y = 1.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$ and $$ S = 1.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.00300 \m)^2 = 2.83 \times 10^{-5} \mm $$
</div>

2. Decompose the force:
   - Shear component (perpendicular to pencil): $$ F_\perp = F\cos 20° = 6.00 \cos 20° = 5.64 \N $$
   - Compressive component (along pencil): $$ F_\parallel = F\sin 20° = 6.00 \sin 20° = 2.05 \N $$

(a) Shear deformation (flex perpendicular to length):
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{F_\perp L}{AS} = \frac{(5.64 \N)(0.0200 \m)}{(2.83 \times 10^{-5} \mm)(1.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{0.1128}{2.83 \times 10^5} = 3.99 \times 10^{-7} \m $$
</div>

(b) Compression (lengthwise):
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{F_\parallel L}{AY} = \frac{(2.05 \N)(0.0200 \m)}{(2.83 \times 10^{-5} \mm)(1.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{0.0410}{4.24 \times 10^5} = 9.67 \times 10^{-8} \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pencil wood flexes by $$ 3.99 \times 10^{-7} \m $$ perpendicular to its length and compresses by $$ 9.67 \times 10^{-8} \m $$ along its length. Both deformations are extremely small (less than a micrometer) and completely imperceptible during normal use. The shear deformation is about 4 times larger than the compression because the shear component of force is larger and the shear modulus is slightly lower than Young's modulus.

To consider the effect of wires hung on poles, we take data
from [Example 2](../contents/ch4FurtherApplicationsOfNewtonsLawsOfMotion.md), in which tensions in wires
supporting a traffic light were calculated. The left wire made an angle $$ 30.0^\circ $$
below the horizontal with the top of its pole and carried a tension of 108 N.
The 12.0 m tall hollow aluminum pole is equivalent in stiffness to a 4.50 cm
diameter solid cylinder.
(a) How far is it bent to the side?
(b) By how much is it compressed?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The wire tension has both a horizontal component (causing the pole to bend sideways) and a vertical component (compressing the pole). We decompose the force and apply shear and compression formulas. For aluminum, $$ Y = 7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$ and $$ S = 2.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0225 \m)^2 = 1.59 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$
</div>

2. Decompose the tension force:
   - Horizontal component: $$ F_H = T\cos 30° = 108 \cos 30° = 93.5 \N $$
   - Vertical component: $$ F_V = T\sin 30° = 108 \sin 30° = 54.0 \N $$

(a) Sideways bending (shear deformation):
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{F_H L}{AS} = \frac{(93.5 \N)(12.0 \m)}{(1.59 \times 10^{-3} \mm)(2.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{1122}{3.98 \times 10^7} = 2.82 \times 10^{-5} \m = 0.0282 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

(b) Compression:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{F_V L}{AY} = \frac{(54.0 \N)(12.0 \m)}{(1.59 \times 10^{-3} \mm)(7.0 \times 10^{10} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{648}{1.11 \times 10^8} = 5.82 \times 10^{-6} \m = 0.00582 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pole bends $$ 0.028 \text{ mm} $$ to the side and is compressed by $$ 0.006 \text{ mm} $$. These tiny deformations are completely negligible and demonstrate why aluminum poles are suitable for supporting traffic lights and power lines despite the constant tension from the wires.

A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly.
The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume
increases by 0.2% (that is, $$ \Delta V/ V_{0}=2\times 10^{-3} $$)
relative to the space available. Calculate the magnitude of the normal force
exerted by the juice per square centimeter if its bulk modulus is $$ 1.8\times
10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2} $$, assuming the bottle does not break. In view of your
answer, do you think the bottle will survive?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The bulk modulus relates pressure change to volume change: $$ B = -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V/V_0} $$. Since the bottle prevents expansion, the juice is effectively compressed, creating pressure. We solve for the pressure.

**Solution**

1. Apply the bulk modulus formula:
<div class="equation">
$$ B = -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V/V_0} $$
</div>

2. Solve for pressure change (the negative sign accounts for the fact that positive pressure causes volume decrease, but here the juice is trying to expand):
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = B \times \frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = (1.8 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2)(2 \times 10^{-3}) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ N/m}^2 \approx 4 \times 10^6 \text{ N/m}^2 $$
</div>

3. Convert to more familiar units:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = 4 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} = 40 \text{ bar} \approx 36 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pressure exerted by the juice on the bottle is approximately $$ 4 \times 10^6 \text{ N/m}^2 $$ or about 36 atmospheres. A typical glass bottle can withstand only about 10-20 atm before failing. The bottle will almost certainly break! This is why wine and juice bottles are not filled completely to the brim—the headspace allows for thermal expansion without building dangerous pressures.

(a) When water freezes, its volume increases by 9.05%
(that is, $$ \Delta V/ V_{0}=9.05 \times 10^{-2} $$).
What force per unit area is water capable of exerting on a container when it
freezes? (It is acceptable to use the bulk modulus of water in this problem.)
(b) Is it surprising that such forces can fracture engine blocks, boulders, and
the like?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the same approach as the previous problem, applying the bulk modulus relationship. From Table 3, the bulk modulus of water is $$ B = 2.2 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the pressure from freezing water:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = B \times \frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = (2.2 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2)(9.05 \times 10^{-2}) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = 1.99 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}^2 \approx 2.0 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}^2 $$
</div>

Convert to atmospheres:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = \frac{2.0 \times 10^8}{1.01 \times 10^5} \approx 2000 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

(b) Analysis of the result:

This pressure of about 2000 atmospheres is enormous—roughly 200 times greater than the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean! The tensile strength of cast iron (used in engine blocks) is about $$ 1-2 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}^2 $$, and even steel's tensile strength is only about $$ 4 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}^2 $$. Rocks typically fail at much lower pressures.

**Discussion**

Water freezing in a confined space can exert a pressure of approximately $$ 2.0 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}^2 $$ (about 2000 atm). This explains why freezing water can crack engine blocks, split pipes, and fracture boulders. The force is sufficient to exceed the tensile strength of most materials. This phenomenon, called frost wedging, is a major force in the weathering of rocks and why it's essential to winterize plumbing systems in cold climates.

This problem returns to the tightrope walker studied
in Example 2 of [Normal Tension and Other Examples Of Forces](../contents/ch4NormalTensionAndOtherExamplesOfForces.md),
who created a tension of $$ 3.94
\times 10^
{3}N $$
in a wire making an angle $$ 5.0^\circ $$ below the horizontal with each
supporting pole. Calculate how much this tension stretches the steel wire if it
was originally 15 m long and 0.50 cm in diameter.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use $$ \Delta L = \frac{FL_0}{AY} $$ to find the stretch. The tension $$ T = 3.94 \times 10^3 \N $$ acts along the wire. For steel, Young's modulus is $$ Y = 2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0025 \m)^2 = 1.96 \times 10^{-5} \mm $$
</div>

2. Calculate the stretch:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{TL_0}{AY} = \frac{(3.94 \times 10^3 \N)(15 \m)}{(1.96 \times 10^{-5} \mm)(2.1 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">

</div>

**Discussion**

The steel wire stretches by approximately $$ 1.4 \text{ cm} $$ under the tightrope walker's weight. This represents a strain of about 0.1%, which is within steel's elastic limit. The stretch explains why tightrope wires sag when someone walks on them—the wire must stretch to create the angle that allows vertical components of tension to support the walker's weight. Professional tightrope artists account for this stretch when setting up their equipment.

The pole in [Figure 10](#Figure10) is at a $$ 90.0^\circ $$
bend in a power line and is therefore subjected to more shear force than poles
in straight parts of the line. The tension in each line is $$ 4.00 \times
10^{4}N $$, at the angles shown. The pole is 15.0 m tall, has an 18.0 cm
diameter, and can be considered to have half the stiffness of hardwood.

(b) Find how much it bends and in what direction.
(c) Find the tension in a guy wire used to keep the pole straight if it is attached

Clearly, the guy wire must be in the opposite direction of the bend.)

![A telephone pole is located at a ninety degree bend in a power line. Each part of the line is at an angle of eighty degrees with the pole and has a tension labeled T. A guy wire is attached to the top of the pole at an angle of thirty degrees with the vertical.](../resources/Figure_05_03_10.jpg "This telephone pole is at a 90 degrees bend in a power line. A guy wire is attached to the top of the pole at an angle of 30 degrees with the vertical.")
{: #Figure10}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

At a 90° bend, the two wire tensions at 80° from vertical combine to create net horizontal and vertical forces on the pole. The vertical components compress the pole; the horizontal components (which don't cancel at a bend) cause it to bend. For hardwood at half stiffness: $$ Y = 0.5 \times 1.5 \times 10^{10} = 7.5 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$ and $$ S = 0.5 \times 1.0 \times 10^{10} = 5.0 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.090 \m)^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-2} \mm $$
</div>

2. Decompose the forces from each wire (each at 80° from vertical = 10° from horizontal):
   - Vertical component (each): $$ F_V = T\cos 80° = (4.00 \times 10^4)\cos 80° = 6.95 \times 10^3 \N $$
   - Horizontal component (each): $$ F_H = T\sin 80° = (4.00 \times 10^4)\sin 80° = 3.94 \times 10^4 \N $$

3. At a 90° bend, the horizontal components are perpendicular to each other:
   - Net horizontal force: $$ F_{H,net} = \sqrt{2} \times F_H = 1.414 \times 3.94 \times 10^4 = 5.57 \times 10^4 \N $$
   - Total vertical force: $$ F_{V,total} = 2 \times F_V = 2 \times 6.95 \times 10^3 = 1.39 \times 10^4 \N $$
   - Direction of bend: 45° from each wire direction (bisecting the 90° angle)

(a) Compression of the pole:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{F_{V,total} \cdot L_0}{AY} = \frac{(1.39 \times 10^4)(15.0)}{(2.54 \times 10^{-2})(7.5 \times 10^9)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = \frac{2.09 \times 10^5}{1.91 \times 10^8} = 1.09 \times 10^{-3} \m = 1.1 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

(b) Bending of the pole:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{F_{H,net} \cdot L_0}{AS} = \frac{(5.57 \times 10^4)(15.0)}{(2.54 \times 10^{-2})(5.0 \times 10^9)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = \frac{8.36 \times 10^5}{1.27 \times 10^8} = 6.6 \times 10^{-3} \m = 6.6 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

The pole bends in the direction that bisects the 90° angle (45° from each wire).

(c) Guy wire tension:

The guy wire must provide a horizontal force component equal to $$ F_{H,net} $$ to straighten the pole:
<div class="equation">
$$ T_{guy}\sin 30° = F_{H,net} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T_{guy} = \frac{F_{H,net}}{\sin 30°} = \frac{5.57 \times 10^4}{0.500} = 1.11 \times 10^5 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pole is compressed by $$ 1.1 \text{ mm} $$ and bends $$ 6.6 \text{ mm} $$ in the direction bisecting the 90° bend. To keep the pole straight, a guy wire with tension $$ 1.11 \times 10^5 \N $$ (about 25,000 lbs) is needed. This substantial force explains why guy wires at corner poles must be anchored very securely, often to large concrete blocks buried in the ground.
