![Water surface of a river is shown, with mountains in the background. There are small ripples over the water surface.](../resources/Figure_16_10_01.jpg 'These waves result from the superposition of several waves from different sources, producing a complex pattern. (credit: waterborough, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure1}

Most waves do not look very simple. They look more like the waves
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) than like the simple water wave considered
in [Waves](../contents/ch16Waves). (Simple waves may be created by a simple harmonic
oscillation, and thus have a sinusoidal shape). Complex waves are more
interesting, even beautiful, but they look formidable. Most waves appear complex
because they result from several simple waves adding together. Luckily, the
rules for adding waves are quite simple.

When two or more waves arrive at the same point, they superimpose themselves on
one another. More specifically, the disturbances of waves are superimposed when
they come together—a phenomenon called **superposition**. Each disturbance
corresponds to a force, and forces add. If the disturbances are along the same
line, then the resulting wave is a simple addition of the disturbances of the
individual waves—that is, their amplitudes add. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)
and [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) illustrate superposition in two special cases, both
of which produce simple results.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows two identical waves that arrive at the same point
exactly in phase. The crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the
troughs. This superposition produces pure **constructive interference**. Because
the disturbances add, pure constructive interference produces a wave that has
twice the amplitude of the individual waves, but has the same wavelength.

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of
phase—that is, precisely aligned crest to trough—producing pure **destructive
interference**. Because the disturbances are in the opposite direction for this
superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive
interference—the waves completely cancel.

![The graph shows two identical waves that arrive at the same point exactly in phase. The crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. The amplitude of each wave being X . It produces pure constructive wave. The disturbances add resulting in a new wave with twice the amplitude of the individual waves that is two X but of same wavelength.](../resources/Figure_16_10_02.jpg 'Pure constructive interference of two identical waves produces one with twice the amplitude, but the same wavelength.')
{: #Figure2}

![The graph shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase. The crests of one wave are aligned with the trough of another wave. Each wave has amplitude equal to X. As the disturbances are in the opposite directions, they cancel out each other, resulting in zero amplitude which is shown as the third figure showing a green straight line, that is, the waves cancel each other producing pure destructive interference.](../resources/Figure_16_10_03.jpg 'Pure destructive interference of two identical waves produces zero amplitude, or complete cancellation.')
{: #Figure3}

While pure constructive and pure destructive interference do occur, they require
precisely aligned identical waves. The superposition of most waves produces a
combination of constructive and destructive interference and can vary from place
to place and time to time. Sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one
spot and quiet in another. Varying loudness means the sound waves add partially
constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has
at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls.
All these waves superimpose. An example of sounds that vary over time from
constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of airplane jets
heard by a stationary passenger. The combined sound can fluctuate up and down in
volume as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to
destructive. These examples are of waves that are similar.

An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). Here again, the disturbances add and subtract,
producing a more complicated looking wave.

![The graph shows two non-identical waves with different frequencies and wavelengths. In the first graph only one crest and one trough of the wave are seen. In the second figure five crests are seen in the same length. When they superimpose, the disturbance add and subtract, producing a more complicated looking wave with highly irregular amplitude and wavelength due to combined effect of constructive and destructive interference.](../resources/Figure_16_10_04.jpg 'Superposition of non-identical waves exhibits both constructive and destructive interference.')
{: #Figure4}

### Standing Waves

Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place.
Unmoving waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator,
for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk
that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. These
waves are formed by the superposition of two or more moving waves, such as
illustrated in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) for two identical waves moving in opposite
directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as
they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they
alternate between constructive and destructive interference. The resultant looks
like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a **standing wave**. Waves on
the glass of milk are one example of standing waves. There are other standing
waves, such as on guitar strings and in organ pipes. With the glass of milk, the
two waves that produce standing waves may come from reflections from the side of
the glass.

A closer look at earthquakes provides evidence for conditions appropriate for
resonance, standing waves, and constructive and destructive interference. A
building may be vibrated for several seconds with a driving frequency matching
that of the natural frequency of vibration of the building—producing a resonance
resulting in one building collapsing while neighboring buildings do not. Often
buildings of a certain height are devastated while other taller buildings remain
intact. The building height matches the condition for setting up a standing wave
for that particular height. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of
Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain
points. Often areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther
away are damaged.

![Standing wave combinations of two waves is shown. At the time t is equal to zero. The waves are in the same phase so the amplitude of the superimposed wave is double that of wave one and two. In the second figure at time t is equal to one fourth of time period T , the waves are in opposite phase so their super imposed figure is a straight line. Again at the time t is equal to half the time period the waves are in the same phase and the process is repeated at t is equal to three fourth of time period and at the end of the time period T.](../resources/Figure_16_10_05.jpg 'Standing wave created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at fixed locations in space and result from alternately constructive and destructive interference.')
{: #Figure5}

Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due
to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. [[Figure 6]](#Figure6)
and [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) show three standing waves that can be created on a
string that is fixed at both ends. **Nodes** are the points where the string
does not move; more generally, nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a
standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string
cannot move there. The word **antinode** is used to denote the location of
maximum amplitude in standing waves. Standing waves on strings have a frequency
that is related to the propagation speed $${v}_{\text{w}} $$ of the disturbance
on the string. The wavelength $$\lambda $$ is determined by the distance between
the points where the string is fixed in place.

The lowest frequency, called the **fundamental frequency**, is thus for the
longest wavelength, which is seen to be $${\lambda }_{1}=2L $$ . Therefore, the
fundamental frequency is $${f}_{1}={v}_{\text{w}}/{\lambda }_{1}={v}_ {\text{w}}/2L $$ . In this case, the **overtones** or harmonics are multiples of
the fundamental frequency. As seen in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7), the first harmonic
can easily be calculated since $${\lambda }_{2}=L $$ . Thus, $${f}_{2}={v}_ {\text{w}}/{\lambda }_{2}={v}_{\text{w}}/2L={2f}_{1} $$ . Similarly, $${f}_
{3}={3f}_{1} $$ , and so on. All of these frequencies can be changed by adjusting the tension in the string. The greater the tension, the greater $${v}_
{\text{w}} $$ is and the higher the frequencies. This observation is familiar to
anyone who has ever observed a string instrument being tuned. We will see in
later chapters that standing waves are crucial to many resonance phenomena, such
as in sounding boxes on string instruments.

{: #Figure6}

![first overtone is shown as the wave length if lambda two is L and there are three nodes and two antinodes in the figure. For first overtone the frequency f two is equal to two times f one.](../resources/Figure_16_10_07.jpg 'First and second harmonic frequencies are shown.')
{: #Figure7}

### Beats

Striking two adjacent keys on a piano produces a warbling combination usually
considered to be unpleasant. The superposition of two waves of similar but not
identical frequencies is the culprit. Another example is often noticeable in jet
aircraft, particularly the two-engine variety, while taxiing. The combined sound
of the engines goes up and down in loudness. This varying loudness happens
because the sound waves have similar but not identical frequencies. The
discordant warbling of the piano and the fluctuating loudness of the jet engine
noise are both due to alternately constructive and destructive interference as
the two waves go in and out of phase. [[Figure 8]](#Figure8) illustrates this
graphically.

![The graph shows the superimposition of two similar but non-identical waves. Beats are produced by alternating destructive and constructive waves with equal amplitude but different frequencies. The resultant wave is the one with rising and falling amplitude over different intervals of time.](../resources/Figure_16_10_08.jpg 'Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies but identical amplitudes. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resulting wave a time-varying amplitude.')
{: #Figure8}

The wave resulting from the superposition of two similar-frequency waves has a
frequency that is the average of the two. This wave fluctuates in amplitude,
or _beats_, with a frequency called the **beat frequency**. We can determine the
beat frequency by adding two waves together mathematically. Note that a wave can
be represented at one point in space as

<div class="equation" >
 $$x=X \cos\left(\frac{2\pi  t}{T}\right)=X \cos\left(2\pi  \text{ft}\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$f=1/T $$ is the frequency of the wave. Adding two waves that have
different frequencies but identical amplitudes produces a resultant

<div class="equation" >
 $$x={x}_{1}+{x}_{2}\text{.} $$
</div>

More specifically,

<div class="equation" >
 $$x=X \cos\left(2\pi  {f}_{1}t\right)+X \cos\left(2\pi  {f}_{2}t\right)\text{.} $$
</div>

Using a trigonometric identity, it can be shown that

<div class="equation" >
 $$x=2X \cos\left(\pi  {f}_{\text{B}}t\right)\cos\left(2\pi  {f}_{\text{ave}}t\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{B}=\mid {f}_{1}-{f}_{2}\mid  $$
</div>

is the beat frequency, and $${f}_{\text{ave}} $$ is the average of $${f}_{1} $$
and $${f}_{2} $$ . These results mean that the resultant wave has twice the
amplitude and the average frequency of the two superimposed waves, but it also
fluctuates in overall amplitude at the beat frequency $${f}_{\text{B}} $$ . The
first cosine term in the expression effectively causes the amplitude to go up
and down. The second cosine term is the wave with frequency $${f}\_{\text{ave}} $$

. This result is valid for all types of waves. However, if it is a sound
wave, providing the two frequencies are similar, then what we hear is an average
frequency that gets louder and softer (or warbles) at the beat frequency.

Making Career Connections
</div>
Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats and adjust the string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). For example, if the tuning fork has a  $$256 \text{Hz} $$
 frequency and two beats per second are heard, then the other frequency is either  $$254 $$
 or  $$258 \text{Hz} $$ .
 Most keys hit multiple strings, and these strings are actually adjusted until they have nearly the same frequency and give a slow beat for richness. Twelve-string guitars and mandolins are also tuned using beats.

</div>

While beats may sometimes be annoying in audible sounds, we will find that beats
have many applications. Observing beats is a very useful way to compare similar
frequencies. There are applications of beats as apparently disparate as in
ultrasonic imaging and radar speed traps.

Imagine you are holding one end of a jump rope, and your friend holds the other. If your friend holds her end still, you can move your end up and down, creating a transverse wave. If your friend then begins to move her end up and down, generating a wave in the opposite direction, what resultant wave forms would you expect to see in the jump rope?

The rope would alternate between having waves with amplitudes two times the original amplitude and reaching equilibrium with no amplitude at all. The wavelengths will result in both constructive and destructive interference

With multiple speakers putting out sounds into the room, and these sounds bouncing off walls, there is bound to be some wave interference. In the dull areas, the interference is probably mostly destructive. In the louder areas, the interference is probably mostly constructive.

### Section Summary

* Superposition is the combination of two waves at the same location.
* Constructive interference occurs when two identical waves are superimposed in
  phase.
* Destructive interference occurs when two identical waves are superimposed
  exactly out of phase.
* A standing wave is one in which two waves superimpose to produce a wave that
  varies in amplitude but does not propagate.
* Nodes are points of no motion in standing waves.
* An antinode is the location of maximum amplitude of a standing wave.
* Waves on a string are resonant standing waves with a fundamental frequency and
  can occur at higher multiples of the fundamental, called overtones or
  harmonics.
* Beats occur when waves of similar frequencies $${f}_{1} $$ and $${f}_{2} $$
  are superimposed. The resulting amplitude oscillates with a beat frequency
  given by

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A car has two horns, one emitting a frequency of 199 Hz and the other emitting a frequency of 203 Hz. What beat frequency do they produce?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The beat frequency is the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies. We can use the formula $${f}_{\text{B}}=\mid {f}_{1}-{f}_{2}\mid $$ where $${f}_{1}=199 \text{ Hz} $$ and $${f}_{2}=203 \text{ Hz} $$.

**Solution**

Apply the beat frequency formula:

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B}}=\mid {f}_{1}-{f}_{2}\mid =\mid 199 \text{ Hz}-203 \text{ Hz}\mid $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B}}=\mid -4 \text{ Hz}\mid =4 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

A beat frequency of 4 Hz means that the combined sound from the two horns will get louder and softer 4 times per second. This is a noticeable warbling effect that would be easily heard. The relatively small beat frequency makes sense because the two horn frequencies (199 Hz and 203 Hz) are quite close to each other. This type of interference pattern is common when two sound sources with slightly different frequencies operate simultaneously.

**Answer**

$$f=4 \text{ Hz} $$

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The middle-C hammer of a piano hits two strings, producing beats of 1.50 Hz. One of the strings is tuned to 260.00 Hz. What frequencies could the other string have?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The beat frequency is the absolute value of the difference between two frequencies: $${f}_{\text{B}}=|{f}_{1}-{f}_{2}|$$. Given that one string has frequency $${f}_{1}=260.00$$ Hz and the beat frequency is 1.50 Hz, the other string's frequency $${f}_{2}$$ could be either higher or lower than 260.00 Hz by 1.50 Hz.

**Solution**

From the beat frequency formula:

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B}}=|{f}_{1}-{f}_{2}|$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$1.50 \text{ Hz}=|260.00 \text{ Hz}-{f}_{2}|$$
</div>

This absolute value equation has two solutions:

**Case 1:** $${f}_{2}$$ is higher than $${f}_{1}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$1.50={f}_{2}-260.00$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{2}=260.00+1.50=261.50 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Case 2:** $${f}_{2}$$ is lower than $${f}_{1}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$1.50=260.00-{f}_{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{2}=260.00-1.50=258.50 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**The other string could have a frequency of either 258.50 Hz or 261.50 Hz.**

**Discussion**

Both frequencies are physically possible and would produce the same beat frequency of 1.50 Hz. In piano tuning, this ambiguity is resolved by listening carefully or using a reference tuning fork. If the beats get faster when you slightly tighten the string (increasing its frequency), the string is currently below the target frequency (258.50 Hz). If the beats get slower, the string is above the target (261.50 Hz).

The beat frequency of 1.50 Hz would be easily noticeable—the sound would pulse or throb 1.5 times per second, creating an unpleasant warbling effect. Piano tuners adjust strings until the beat frequency disappears completely, indicating the two strings are perfectly matched. For middle C, having both strings at exactly 260.00 Hz produces a pure, stable tone without the interference pattern that creates beats.

Two tuning forks having frequencies of 460 and 464 Hz are struck simultaneously. What average frequency will you hear, and what will the beat frequency be?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When two tuning forks with different frequencies are struck simultaneously, you hear a sound at the average frequency that fluctuates in amplitude at the beat frequency. The average frequency is {% raw %}$${f}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{{f}_{1}+{f}_{2}}{2} $${% endraw %} and the beat frequency is {% raw %}$${f}_{\text{B}}=\mid {f}_{1}-{f}_{2}\mid $${% endraw %}.

**Solution**

Calculate the average frequency:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${f}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{{f}_{1}+{f}_{2}}{2}=\frac{460 \text{ Hz}+464 \text{ Hz}}{2} $${% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{924 \text{ Hz}}{2}=462 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

Calculate the beat frequency:

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B}}=\mid {f}_{1}-{f}_{2}\mid =\mid 460 \text{ Hz}-464 \text{ Hz}\mid $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B}}=4 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The average frequency of 462 Hz is exactly midway between the two individual frequencies, which is what we expect from the superposition of two waves with similar frequencies. The beat frequency of 4 Hz means you would hear the volume of the combined sound increase and decrease 4 times per second. This beat frequency is slow enough to be easily perceived by the human ear, which is why tuning forks are often used in pairs to demonstrate the phenomenon of beats. Musicians and piano tuners use this principle to tune instruments by adjusting strings until the beat frequency approaches zero.

Twin jet engines on an airplane are producing an average sound frequency of 4100 Hz with a beat frequency of 0.500 Hz. What are their individual frequencies?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We're given the average frequency {% raw %}$${f}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{{f}_{1}+{f}_{2}}{2}=4100$${% endraw %} Hz and the beat frequency $${f}_{\text{B}}=|{f}_{1}-{f}_{2}|=0.500$$ Hz. We can use these two equations to solve for the two individual frequencies $${f}_{1}$$ and $${f}_{2}$$.

**Solution**

From the average frequency:

<div class="equation">
 {% raw %}$$\frac{{f}_{1}+{f}_{2}}{2}=4100$${% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{1}+{f}_{2}=8200 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

From the beat frequency (assuming $${f}_{2}>{f}_{1}$$):

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{2}-{f}_{1}=0.500 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. Adding them:

<div class="equation">
 $$({f}_{1}+{f}_{2})+({f}_{2}-{f}_{1})=8200+0.500$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$2{f}_{2}=8200.5$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{2}=4100.25 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

From the first equation:

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{1}=8200-{f}_{2}=8200-4100.25=4099.75 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**The two jet engines have frequencies of 4099.75 Hz and 4100.25 Hz (or 4.10 kHz ± 0.25 Hz).**

**Discussion**

The two engines produce sounds that are very close in frequency—differing by only 0.5 Hz out of about 4100 Hz, or about 0.012%. This small difference creates a beat frequency of 0.5 Hz, meaning the sound intensity would fluctuate twice per second (two complete beats per second).

This beating effect would be audible to passengers and crew as a slow pulsing or throbbing in the engine noise. While not particularly disturbing at such a low beat frequency, pilots and mechanics monitor engine sounds for such beats because they can indicate that one engine is operating at slightly different conditions than the other—perhaps due to different fuel flow, temperature, or mechanical wear.

The average frequency of 4100 Hz is in the upper range of human hearing and corresponds to a high-pitched whine characteristic of jet engines. The precision needed to match the two engines to better than 0.5 Hz at 4100 Hz demonstrates the remarkably uniform operating conditions modern jet engines can maintain.

A wave traveling on a Slinky® that is stretched to 4 m takes 2.4 s to travel the length of the Slinky and back again. (a) What is the speed of the wave? (b) Using the same Slinky stretched to the same length, a standing wave is created which consists of three antinodes and four nodes. At what frequency must the Slinky be oscillating?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

(a) The wave travels the length of the Slinky and back again in 2.4 s, so the total distance is $$2 \times 4 \text{ m}=8 \text{ m} $$. We can find the wave speed using $${v}_{\text{w}}=\frac{d}{t} $$.

(b) For a standing wave with 3 antinodes and 4 nodes on a Slinky fixed at both ends, we need to determine the wavelength from the standing wave pattern, then use $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda $$ to find the frequency.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the wave speed:

<div class="equation">
 $$d=2 \times 4 \text{ m}=8 \text{ m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=\frac{d}{t}=\frac{8 \text{ m}}{2.4 \text{ s}}=3.33 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

(b) A standing wave with 3 antinodes and 4 nodes (including the fixed ends) has 3 complete loops. This means the length of the Slinky equals $$\frac{3\lambda }{2} $$, where $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength.

<div class="equation">
 $$L=\frac{3\lambda }{2} $$
</div>

Solve for the wavelength:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda =\frac{2L}{3}=\frac{2\left(4 \text{ m}\right)}{3}=2.67 \text{ m} $$
</div>

Use the wave equation to find the frequency:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$f=\frac{{v}_{\text{w}}}{\lambda }=\frac{3.33 \text{ m/s}}{2.67 \text{ m}}=1.25 \text{ Hz} $${% endraw %}
</div>

**Discussion**

The wave speed of 3.33 m/s is reasonable for a wave traveling on a stretched Slinky. This is much slower than waves on taut strings but faster than waves on very loose springs. The frequency of 1.25 Hz (about once per second) is also reasonable—you could easily observe this oscillation by eye. The standing wave pattern with 3 antinodes represents the third harmonic, which has a frequency three times lower than what would be needed to create 9 antinodes. Standing waves on Slinkys are excellent demonstrations of wave interference and resonance because they're large enough to see clearly and slow enough to observe the motion.

Three adjacent keys on a piano (F, F-sharp, and G) are struck simultaneously, producing frequencies of 349, 370, and 392 Hz. What beat frequencies are produced by this discordant combination?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When three frequencies are present simultaneously, beats occur between each pair of frequencies. We need to calculate the beat frequency for all three possible pairs: F with F-sharp, F-sharp with G, and F with G. The beat frequency for each pair is the absolute value of the difference between their frequencies.

**Solution**

The three frequencies are:
- F: $${f}_{1}=349$$ Hz
- F-sharp: $${f}_{2}=370$$ Hz
- G: $${f}_{3}=392$$ Hz

**Beat frequency between F and F-sharp:**

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B,12}}=|{f}_{2}-{f}_{1}|=|370-349|=21 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Beat frequency between F-sharp and G:**

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B,23}}=|{f}_{3}-{f}_{2}|=|392-370|=22 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Beat frequency between F and G:**

<div class="equation">
 $${f}_{\text{B,13}}=|{f}_{3}-{f}_{1}|=|392-349|=43 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**The beat frequencies produced are 21 Hz, 22 Hz, and 43 Hz.**

**Discussion**

This combination produces three distinct beat frequencies simultaneously, creating a complex and dissonant sound. The 21 Hz and 22 Hz beats are in the range where they can be heard as distinct pulsations or roughness in the sound. The 43 Hz beat frequency is fast enough that it might be perceived more as a buzz or roughness rather than distinct pulses.

Note that the beat frequency between F and G (43 Hz) equals the sum of the other two beat frequencies (21 + 22 = 43 Hz). This makes sense mathematically: $${f}_{\text{B,13}}=({f}_{3}-{f}_{2})+({f}_{2}-{f}_{1})={f}_{\text{B,23}}+{f}_{\text{B,12}}$$.

The term "discordant" in the problem statement is appropriate—these three notes form a dissonant chord. While F and G are separated by a whole step (pleasant interval), adding F-sharp creates a semitone clash with both neighboring notes. The multiple beat frequencies create a harsh, unpleasant sound that lacks the smoothness of consonant harmonies. This is why such combinations are typically avoided in music except for special effects or in certain jazz and contemporary compositions where dissonance is used deliberately.

Musicians and piano tuners can hear these beats clearly when tuning adjacent notes, and the presence of strong beats indicates the piano needs adjustment.
