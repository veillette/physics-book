* Define nuclear fusion.
* Discuss processes to achieve practical fusion energy generation.
</div>

While basking in the warmth of the summer sun, a student reads of the latest
breakthrough in achieving sustained thermonuclear power and vaguely recalls
hearing about the cold fusion controversy. The three are connected. The Sun’s
energy is produced by nuclear fusion (see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Thermonuclear
power is the name given to the use of controlled nuclear fusion as an energy
source. While research in the area of thermonuclear power is progressing, high
temperatures and containment difficulties remain. The cold fusion controversy
centered around unsubstantiated claims of practical fusion power at room
temperatures.

{: #Figure1}

**Nuclear fusion** is a reaction in which two nuclei are combined, or _fused_,
to form a larger nucleus. We know that all nuclei have less mass than the sum of
the masses of the protons and neutrons that form them. The missing mass times
$${c}^{2} $$ equals the binding energy of the nucleus—the greater the binding
energy, the greater the missing mass. We also know that $$\text{BE}/A $$ , the
binding energy per nucleon, is greater for medium-mass nuclei and has a maximum
at Fe (iron). This means that if two low-mass nuclei can be fused together to
form a larger nucleus, energy can be released. The larger nucleus has a greater
binding energy and less mass per nucleon than the two that combined. Thus mass
is destroyed in the fusion reaction, and energy is released (
see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). On average, fusion of low-mass nuclei releases
energy, but the details depend on the actual nuclides involved.

![This figure is a graph of atomic mass as horizontal axis versus binding energy per nucleon as vertical axis showing that, as a function of atomic mass, the binding energy per nucleon steeply increases from zero to about 9 M e V per nucleon then, after attaining a peak, slowly decreases to about 8 M e V per nucleon.](../resources/Figure_32_05_02.jpg 'Fusion of light nuclei to form medium-mass nuclei destroys mass, because ( \\text{BE}/A ) is greater for the product nuclei. The larger ( \\text{BE}/A ) is, the less mass per nucleon, and so mass is converted to energy and released in these fusion reactions.')
{: #Figure2}

The major obstruction to fusion is the Coulomb repulsion between nuclei. Since
the attractive nuclear force that can fuse nuclei together is short ranged, the
repulsion of like positive charges must be overcome to get nuclei close enough
to induce fusion. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows an approximate graph of the
potential energy between two nuclei as a function of the distance between their
centers. The graph is analogous to a hill with a well in its center. A ball
rolled from the right must have enough kinetic energy to get over the hump
before it falls into the deeper well with a net gain in energy. So it is with
fusion. If the nuclei are given enough kinetic energy to overcome the electric
potential energy due to repulsion, then they can combine, release energy, and
fall into a deep well. One way to accomplish this is to heat fusion fuel to high
temperatures so that the kinetic energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get
the nuclei together.

![The graph shows potential energy as a function of distance r. The potential energy is negative for small r, then rises sharply to a positive peak at medium r, then falls back asymptotically to zero for large r. The curve at small r is labeled “attractive nuclear,” and the curve at large r is labeled “repulsive Coulomb.” A small ball is drawn to the left of the peak with an arrow indicating that the ball is moving down the potential energy curve toward the negative potential energy well. This ball is labeled “pulled together.” Another small ball is drawn to the right of the peak with an arrow indicating it is moving toward larger r. This ball is labeled “repelled.”](../resources/Figure_32_05_03.jpg 'Potential energy between two light nuclei graphed as a function of distance between them. If the nuclei have enough kinetic energy to get over the Coulomb repulsion hump, they combine, release energy, and drop into a deep attractive well. Tunneling through the barrier is important in practice. The greater the kinetic energy and the higher the particles get up the barrier (or the lower the barrier), the more likely the tunneling.')
{: #Figure3}

You might think that, in the core of our Sun, nuclei are coming into contact and
fusing. However, in fact, temperatures on the order of $$10^{8}K $$ are needed
to actually get the nuclei in contact, exceeding the core temperature of the
Sun. Quantum mechanical tunneling is what makes fusion in the Sun possible, and
tunneling is an important process in most other practical applications of
fusion, too. Since the probability of tunneling is extremely sensitive to
barrier height and width, increasing the temperature greatly increases the rate
of fusion. The closer reactants get to one another, the more likely they are to
fuse (see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). Thus most fusion in the Sun and other stars
takes place at their centers, where temperatures are highest. Moreover, high
temperature is needed for thermonuclear power to be a practical source of
energy.

![The first part of the figure shows two nuclei approaching each other, then slowing down, then moving away from each other. The second part shows two nuclei approaching and colliding to form a single nucleus that has emitted radiation and a particle.](../resources/Figure_32_05_04.jpg '(a) Two nuclei heading toward each other slow down, then stop, and then fly away without touching or fusing. (b) At higher energies, the two nuclei approach close enough for fusion via tunneling. The probability of tunneling increases as they approach, but they do not have to touch for the reaction to occur.')
{: #Figure4}

The Sun produces energy by fusing protons or hydrogen nuclei $${}^{1}\text{H} $$
(by far the Sun’s most abundant nuclide) into helium nuclei $${}^{4}\text{He} $$
. The principal sequence of fusion reactions forms what is called the **proton-proton cycle**\:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+{e}^{+}+{v}_{\text{e} }                \left(0.42 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{He}+\gamma                          \left(5.49 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{3}\text{He}+{}^{3}\text{He}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+{}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}       \left(12.86 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

where $${e}^{+} $$ stands for a positron and $${v}_{\text{e} } $$ is an electron
neutrino. (The energy in parentheses is _released_ by the reaction.) Note that
the first two reactions must occur twice for the third to be possible, so that
the cycle consumes six protons ( $${}^{1}\text{H} $$ )
but gives back two. Furthermore, the two positrons produced will find two
electrons and annihilate to form four more $$\gamma $$ rays, for a total of six.
The overall effect of the cycle is thus

<div class="equation" >
 $$2{e}^{-}+4{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+{2v}_{\text{e} }+6\gamma         \left(26.7 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

where the 26.7 MeV includes the annihilation energy of the positrons and
electrons and is distributed among all the reaction products. The solar interior
is dense, and the reactions occur deep in the Sun where temperatures are
highest. It takes about 32 000 years for the energy to diffuse to the surface
and radiate away. However, the neutrinos escape the Sun in less than two
seconds, carrying their energy with them, because they interact so weakly that
the Sun is transparent to them. Negative feedback in the Sun acts as a
thermostat to regulate the overall energy output. For instance, if the interior
of the Sun becomes hotter than normal, the reaction rate increases, producing
energy that expands the interior. This cools it and lowers the reaction rate.
Conversely, if the interior becomes too cool, it contracts, increasing the
temperature and reaction rate (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)). Stars like the Sun
are stable for billions of years, until a significant fraction of their hydrogen
has been depleted. What happens then is discussed
in [Introduction to Frontiers of Physics ](../contents/ch34FrontiersOfPhysics).

![In the given figure nuclear fusion in the Sun is shown. The sun is shown like a sunflower. In the center, helium H e is shown. The energy emitted from H E is shown by outward arrows.](../resources/Figure_32_05_05.jpg 'Nuclear fusion in the Sun converts hydrogen nuclei into helium; fusion occurs primarily at the boundary of the helium core, where temperature is highest and sufficient hydrogen remains. Energy released diffuses slowly to the surface, with the exception of neutrinos, which escape immediately. Energy production remains stable because of negative feedback effects.')
{: #Figure5}

Theories of the proton-proton cycle (and other energy-producing cycles in stars)
were pioneered by the German-born, American physicist Hans Bethe (1906–2005),
starting in 1938. He was awarded the 1967 Nobel Prize in physics for this work,
and he has made many other contributions to physics and society. Neutrinos
produced in these cycles escape so readily that they provide us an excellent
means to test these theories and study stellar interiors. Detectors have been
constructed and operated for more than four decades now to measure solar
neutrinos (see [[Figure 6]](#Figure6)). Although solar neutrinos are detected
and neutrinos were observed from Supernova 1987A ([[Figure 7]](#Figure7)), too
few solar neutrinos were observed to be consistent with predictions of solar
energy production. After many years, this solar neutrino problem was resolved
with a blend of theory and experiment that showed that the neutrino does indeed
have mass. It was also found that there are three types of neutrinos, each
associated with a different type of nuclear decay.

![This figure shows an arrangement of shining pegs arranged in concentric circles.](../resources/Figure_32_05_06.jpg 'This array of photomultiplier tubes is part of the large solar neutrino detector at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois. In these experiments, the neutrinos interact with heavy water and produce flashes of light, which are detected by the photomultiplier tubes. In spite of its size and the huge flux of neutrinos that strike it, very few are detected each day since they interact so weakly. This, of course, is the same reason they escape the Sun so readily.

{: #Figure7}

The proton-proton cycle is not a practical source of energy on Earth, in spite
of the great abundance of hydrogen ( $${}^{1}\text{H} $$ ). The reaction
$${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+{e}^{+}+{v}\_{\text{e} } $$ has
a very low probability of occurring. (This is why our Sun will last for about
ten billion years.) However, a number of other fusion reactions are easier to
induce. Among them are:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}       \left(4.03 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{He}+n        \left(3.27 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{3}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+n      \left(17.59 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+\gamma         \left(23.85 \text{MeV}\right). $$
</div>

Deuterium ( $${}^{2}\text{H} $$ )
is about 0.015% of natural hydrogen, so there is an immense amount of it in sea
water alone. In addition to an abundance of deuterium fuel, these fusion
reactions produce large energies per reaction (in parentheses), but they do not
produce much radioactive waste. Tritium ( $${}^{3}\text{H} $$ )
is radioactive, but it is consumed as a fuel (the reaction
$${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{3}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+n $$ ), and the neutrons and
$$\gamma $$ s can be shielded. The neutrons produced can also be used to create
more energy and fuel in reactions like

<div class="equation" >
 $$n+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+\gamma       \left(20.68 \text{MeV}\right) $$
</div>

and

<div class="equation" >
 $$n+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+\gamma      \left(2.22 \text{MeV}\right). $$
</div>

Note that these last two reactions, and $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to
{}^{4}\text{He}+\gamma $$ , put most of their energy output into the $$\gamma $$
ray, and such energy is difficult to utilize.

The three keys to practical fusion energy generation are to achieve the
temperatures necessary to make the reactions likely, to raise the density of the
fuel, and to confine it long enough to produce large amounts of energy. These
three factors—temperature, density, and time—complement one another, and so a
deficiency in one can be compensated for by the others. **Ignition** is defined
to occur when the reactions produce enough energy to be self-sustaining after
external energy input is cut off. This goal, which must be reached before
commercial plants can be a reality, has not been achieved. Another milestone,
called **break-even**, occurs when the fusion power produced equals the heating
power input. Break-even has nearly been reached and gives hope that ignition and
commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades.

Two techniques have shown considerable promise. The first of these is called **magnetic confinement** and uses the property that charged particles have
difficulty crossing magnetic field lines. The tokamak, shown
in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8), has shown particular promise. The tokamak’s toroidal
coil confines charged particles into a circular path with a helical twist due to
the circulating ions themselves. In 1995, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at
Princeton in the US achieved world-record plasma temperatures as high as 500
million degrees Celsius. This facility operated between 1982 and 1997. A joint
international effort is underway in France to build a tokamak-type reactor that
will be the stepping stone to commercial power. ITER, as it is called, will be a
full-scale device that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy. It
will generate 500 MW of power for extended periods of time and will achieve
break-even conditions. It will study plasmas in conditions similar to those
expected in a fusion power plant. Completion is scheduled for 2018.

{: #Figure8}

The second promising technique aims multiple lasers at tiny fuel pellets filled
with a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Huge power input heats the fuel,
evaporating the confining pellet and crushing the fuel to high density with the
expanding hot plasma produced. This technique is called **inertial confinement**
, because the fuel’s inertia prevents it from escaping before significant fusion
can take place. Higher densities have been reached than with tokamaks, but with
smaller confinement times. In 2009, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (CA)
completed a laser fusion device with 192 ultraviolet laser beams that are
focused upon a D-T pellet (see [[Figure 9]](#Figure9)).

<div class="title">
Calculating Energy and Power from Fusion
</div>
(a) Calculate the energy released by the fusion of a 1.00-kg mixture of deuterium and tritium, which produces helium. There are equal numbers of deuterium and tritium nuclei in the mixture.

(b) If this takes place continuously over a period of a year, what is the
average power output?

**Strategy**

According to $${}^{2}\text{H}+{}^{3}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+n $$ , the
energy per reaction is 17.59 MeV. To find the total energy released, we must
find the number of deuterium and tritium atoms in a kilogram. Deuterium has an
atomic mass of about 2 and tritium has an atomic mass of about 3, for a total of
about 5 g per mole of reactants or about 200 mol in 1.00 kg. To get a more
precise figure, we will use the atomic masses from Appendix A. The power output
is best expressed in watts, and so the energy output needs to be calculated in
joules and then divided by the number of seconds in a year.

**Solution for (a)**

The atomic mass of deuterium ( $${}^{2}\text{H} $$ )
is 2.014102 u, while that of tritium ( $${}^{3}\text{H} $$ )
is 3.016049 u, for a total of 5.032151 u per reaction. So a mole of reactants
has a mass of 5.03 g, and in 1.00 kg there are $$\left(1000 \text{g}\right)
/\left(5.03 \text{g/mol}\right) =198.8 \text{mol of reactants} $$ . The number
of reactions that take place is therefore

<div class="equation" >
 $$\left(198.8 \text{mol}\right)\left( 6.02 \times 10^{23}  {\text{mol}}^{-1}\right)= 1.20 \times 10^{26}  \text{reactions}. $$
</div>
The total energy output is the number of reactions times the energy per reaction:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{}E=\left( 1.20 \times 10^{26}  \text{reactions}\right)\left(17.59 \text{MeV/reaction}\right)\left( 1.602 \times 10^{-13}  \text{J/MeV}\right)\\  = 3.37 \times 10^{14}  \text{J}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

Power is energy per unit time. One year has $$ 3.16 \times 10^{7} \text{s} $$,
so

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}P& =& \frac{E}{t}=\frac{ 3.37 \times 10^{14}  \text{J}}{ 3.16 \times 10^{7}  \text{s}}\\ & =&   1.07 \times 10^{7}  \text{W}= 10.7 \text{MW}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

By now we expect nuclear processes to yield large amounts of energy, and we are
not disappointed here. The energy output of $$ 3.37 \times 10^{14} \text{J} $$
from fusing 1.00 kg of deuterium and tritium is equivalent to 2.6 million
gallons of gasoline and about eight times the energy output of the bomb that
destroyed Hiroshima. Yet the average backyard swimming pool has about 6 kg of
deuterium in it, so that fuel is plentiful if it can be utilized in a controlled
manner. The average power output over a year is more than 10 MW, impressive but
a bit small for a commercial power plant. About 32 times this power output would
allow generation of 100 MW of electricity, assuming an efficiency of one-third
in converting the fusion energy to electrical energy.

### Section Summary

- Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two nuclei are combined to form a larger
  nucleus. It releases energy when light nuclei are fused to form medium-mass
  nuclei.
- Fusion is the source of energy in stars, with the proton-proton cycle,

  <div class="equation" >
   $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+{e}^{+}+{v}_{\text{e}}      \left(0.42 \text{MeV}\right) $$
  </div>

  <div class="equation" >
   $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{He}+\gamma          \left(5.49 \text{MeV}\right) $$
  </div>

  <div class="equation" >
   $${}^{3}\text{He}+{}^{3}\text{He}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+{}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}           \left(12.86 \text{MeV}\right) $$
  </div>

being the principal sequence of energy-producing reactions in our Sun.

- The overall effect of the proton-proton cycle is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$2{e}^{-}+4{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+{2v}_{\text{e}}+6\gamma             \left(26.7 \text{MeV}\right), $$
  </div>

where the 26.7 MeV includes the energy of the positrons emitted and annihilated.

- Attempts to utilize controlled fusion as an energy source on Earth are related
  to deuterium and tritium, and the reactions play important roles.
- Ignition is the condition under which controlled fusion is self-sustaining; it
  has not yet been achieved. Break-even, in which the fusion energy output is as
  great as the external energy input, has nearly been achieved.
- Magnetic confinement and inertial confinement are the two methods being
  developed for heating fuel to sufficiently high temperatures, at sufficient
  density, and for sufficiently long times to achieve ignition. The first method
  uses magnetic fields and the second method uses the momentum of impinging
  laser beams for confinement.

**Strategy**

For each reaction, calculate the mass defect and convert to energy using $$E = (\Delta m)c^{2}$$. The three reactions are: (1) $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+{e}^{+}+{v}_{\text{e}}$$, (2) $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{He}+\gamma$$, and (3) $${}^{3}\text{He}+{}^{3}\text{He}\to {}^{4}\text{He}+{}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}$$. Use atomic masses from Appendix A: $$m({}^{1}\text{H}) = 1.007825$$ u, $$m({}^{2}\text{H}) = 2.014102$$ u, $$m({}^{3}\text{He}) = 3.016029$$ u, $$m({}^{4}\text{He}) = 4.002603$$ u, $$m(e) = 0.000549$$ u.

**Solution**

**Reaction 1:** $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{1}\text{H}\to {}^{2}\text{H}+{e}^{+}+{v}_{\text{e}}$$

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta m = 2m({}^{1}\text{H}) - [m({}^{2}\text{H}) + m_e] = 2(1.007825) - [2.014102 + 0.000549] = 0.000999 \text{ u} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_1 = (0.000999)(931.5) = 0.931 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

However, the positron will annihilate with an electron, releasing $$2m_ec^2 = 1.022$$ MeV, but this is external to the nucleus. The nuclear energy release is 0.931 MeV. The text gives 0.42 MeV, which is the energy carried away by the positron and neutrino (kinetic energy), not the total Q-value. Let me recalculate using the Q-value approach properly:

<div class="equation">
$$ Q = [2m({}^{1}\text{H}) - m({}^{2}\text{H}) - 2m_e]c^2 = [2(1.007825) - 2.014102 - 2(0.000549)](931.5) = 0.420 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

**Reaction 2:** $${}^{1}\text{H}+{}^{2}\text{H}\to {}^{3}\text{He}+\gamma$$

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta m = [m({}^{1}\text{H}) + m({}^{2}\text{H})] - m({}^{3}\text{He}) = [1.007825 + 2.014102] - 3.016029 = 0.005898 \text{ u} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_2 = (0.005898)(931.5) = 5.49 \text{ MeV} \quad \checkmark $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta m = 2m({}^{3}\text{He}) - [m({}^{4}\text{He}) + 2m({}^{1}\text{H})] = 2(3.016029) - [4.002603 + 2(1.007825)] = 0.013805 \text{ u} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_3 = (0.013805)(931.5) = 12.86 \text{ MeV} \quad \checkmark $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The calculated values of 0.42 MeV, 5.49 MeV, and 12.86 MeV match the values given in the text for the proton-proton cycle. These energies represent the kinetic energy available to the products. The first reaction has the smallest energy release, which partially explains why it has the lowest probability and longest timescale—the Sun will last about 10 billion years because this bottleneck reaction is so slow. The energy released in each step increases, with the third reaction releasing the most energy per event. However, note that the third reaction requires two $${}^{3}\text{He}$$ nuclei, each of which must be produced by reactions 1 and 2, so the full cycle must have reactions 1 and 2 occur twice before reaction 3 can occur once.

**Strategy**

Count nucleons (A), charge (Z), and electron family number (efn) on both sides. For efn: electrons have efn = +1, positrons have efn = -1, electron neutrinos have efn = +1.

**Solution**

**Before (left side):**
- Nucleons: $$A = 0 + 4(1) = 4$$
- Charge: $$Z = 2(-1) + 4(+1) = -2 + 4 = +2$$
- Electron family number: $$\text{efn} = 2(+1) + 0 = +2$$

**After (right side):**
- Nucleons: $$A = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4$$ ✓
- Charge: $$Z = +2 + 0 + 0 = +2$$ ✓
- Electron family number: $$\text{efn} = 0 + 2(+1) + 0 = +2$$ ✓

All conserved quantities match, verifying conservation laws are satisfied.

**Discussion**

This overall reaction represents the net effect after the proton-proton cycle runs through completely: two electrons from the surrounding medium annihilate with the two positrons produced in the cycle (reactions 1 occurs twice), four protons fuse to form one helium-4 nucleus, two electron neutrinos carry away some energy, and six gamma rays are produced (two from positron-electron annihilation plus those from the reactions). The conservation of nucleon number reflects baryon number conservation—4 protons in, 4 nucleons in helium out. Charge conservation is maintained throughout. Electron family number conservation accounts for the two electrons consumed and two neutrinos produced, balancing the two positrons created and annihilated in intermediate steps.

that in, say, a gallon of gasoline, also taking into consideration that water is

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Find mass of water, then mass of hydrogen (11.1% of water mass), then mass of deuterium (0.0150% of hydrogen). (b) Use the D-D reaction energy of 3.27 MeV and calculate number of reactions. (c) Consider neutron capture reactions. (d) Compare with gasoline energy density.

**Solution**

(a) Mass of water in pool: $$(80,000 \text{ L})(1 \text{ kg/L}) = 80,000 \text{ kg} = 8.0 \times 10^{7} \text{ g}$$

Mass of hydrogen: $$(8.0 \times 10^{7})(0.111) = 8.88 \times 10^{6} \text{ g}$$

Mass of deuterium: $$(8.88 \times 10^{6})(0.000150) = 1.33 \times 10^{3} \text{ g} = 1.33 \text{ kg}$$

(b) Moles of D: $$1330/2.014 = 660 \text{ mol}$$, giving $$N = (660)(6.022 \times 10^{23}) = 3.97 \times 10^{26}$$ atoms.

Number of D-D reactions: $$3.97 \times 10^{26}/2 = 1.99 \times 10^{26}$$

Energy: $$E = (1.99 \times 10^{26})(3.27 \text{ MeV})(1.602 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV}) = 1.04 \times 10^{14} \text{ J}$$

(c) Yes! The neutrons can capture on hydrogen to form deuterium (releasing 2.22 MeV) or on other nuclei, extracting additional energy.

(d) Gasoline has energy density ~$$ 1.3 \times 10^{8} \text{ J/gallon}$$. The pool's deuterium energy equals $$(1.04 \times 10^{14})/(1.3 \times 10^{8}) \approx 800,000$$ gallons of gasoline—an enormous amount from just the deuterium in a backyard pool! And water is essentially free and unlimited compared to fossil fuels.

**Discussion**

This problem dramatically illustrates fusion's potential: a single swimming pool contains deuterium fuel equivalent to 800,000 gallons of gasoline. The oceans contain enough deuterium to power human civilization for billions of years. The challenge isn't fuel availability but achieving the extreme conditions (100 million K temperatures, sufficient density and confinement time) needed to make fusion practical. If fusion can be controlled economically, humanity will have virtually unlimited clean energy, since deuterium comprises 0.015% of all hydrogen in water—a practically inexhaustible supply.

**Strategy**

(a) The proton-proton cycle converts 4 protons to 1 He-4, releasing 26.7 MeV. Find the number of cycles per second from power, then multiply by 4. (b) Each cycle produces 2 neutrinos. Calculate neutrino flux at Earth's distance (1.5 × 10¹¹ m).

**Solution**

(a) Power from p-p cycle: $$(0.90)(4 \times 10^{26}) = 3.6 \times 10^{26} \text{ W}$$

Energy per cycle: $$26.7 \text{ MeV} = (26.7)(1.602 \times 10^{-13}) = 4.28 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J}$$

Cycles per second: $$\frac{3.6 \times 10^{26}}{4.28 \times 10^{-12}} = 8.41 \times 10^{37} \text{ cycles/s}$$

Protons consumed per second: $$(8.41 \times 10^{37})(4) = 3.4 \times 10^{38} \text{ protons/s}$$

(b) Neutrinos produced per second: $$(8.41 \times 10^{37})(2) = 1.68 \times 10^{38} \text{ neutrinos/s}$$

Surface area of sphere at Earth's orbit: $$A = 4\pi r^{2} = 4\pi(1.5 \times 10^{11})^{2} = 2.83 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}^{2}$$

Neutrino flux at Earth: $$\frac{1.68 \times 10^{38}}{2.83 \times 10^{23}} = 5.9 \times 10^{14} \text{ neutrinos/(m}^{2}\cdot\text{s)}$$

**Discussion**

Nearly 600 trillion neutrinos pass through each square meter of Earth every second! Yet detectors observe only a few neutrinos per day because neutrinos interact so weakly with matter—they can pass through the entire Earth without being stopped. This incredibly low interaction probability is why detecting solar neutrinos is so challenging and requires massive detectors. The huge proton consumption rate of $$3.4 \times 10^{38}$$ protons/s sounds enormous, but the Sun contains about $$10^{57}$$ protons, giving it a lifetime of billions of years.

(a) Find the total energy released in MeV in each carbon cycle (elaborated in the above problem) including the annihilation energy.

(b) How does this compare with the proton-proton cycle output?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Calculate using $$E = (4m({}^{1}\text{H}) - m({}^{4}\text{He}))c^{2}$$, which is the same as for the p-p cycle since the carbon is just a catalyst. Add 2 positron annihilations ($$2 \times 2m_ec^2 = 2.044$$ MeV).

**Solution**

(a) Net reaction: $$4{}^{1}\text{H} \to {}^{4}\text{He} + 2e^{+} + 2\nu_e + 7\gamma$$

Nuclear energy: $$E = [4(1.007825) - 4.002603](931.5) = 26.73 \text{ MeV}$$

Including annihilation of 2 positrons with 2 electrons from surroundings, the total is **26.7 MeV** (same as p-p cycle).

(b) The carbon cycle releases the same 26.7 MeV as the proton-proton cycle. This makes sense because both cycles have the same net reaction: converting 4 protons into 1 helium-4 nucleus. The carbon acts only as a catalyst, being regenerated at the end.

**Discussion**

Both the carbon cycle and proton-proton cycle yield identical energy because they accomplish the same net nuclear transformation. The carbon cycle dominates in stars hotter than the Sun (above ~17 million K) because it has a stronger temperature dependence, while the p-p cycle dominates in cooler stars like our Sun. The carbon cycle's reliance on heavier nuclei (C, N, O) means it's only possible in second-generation stars formed from material enriched by earlier stellar nucleosynthesis.

**Solution**

(a) $$P = \frac{100 \times 10^{3} \text{ J}}{1.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}} = 1.0 \times 10^{14} \text{ W} = 100 \text{ TW}$$

the average kinetic energy only needs to be half the electric potential energy
of these doubly charged nuclei when just in contact with one another.

(b) Does this high temperature imply practical difficulties for doing this in
controlled fusion?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Two $${}^{3}\text{He}$$ nuclei (each with charge +2e) need $$\frac{3}{2}kT = \frac{1}{2}U_e$$ where $$U_e = \frac{k(2e)(2e)}{r}$$ and $$r \approx 2 \times 10^{-15}$$ m (sum of nuclear radii). Solve for T. (b) Consider plasma confinement challenges.

**Solution**

(a) Electric potential energy when just touching:

<div class="equation">
$$ U_e = \frac{k(2e)(2e)}{r} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})(4)(1.602 \times 10^{-19})^{2}}{2 \times 10^{-15}} = 4.61 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J} = 2.88 \text{ MeV} $$

</div>

(b) Yes! This temperature of 11 billion kelvin is extremely high—much higher than typical fusion reactor targets (100-200 million K for D-T fusion). At such temperatures, containing the plasma becomes extraordinarily difficult. The plasma would vaporize any material container instantly, requiring advanced magnetic or inertial confinement. This explains why $${}^{3}\text{He}$$ fusion, despite being "cleaner" (no neutrons), is much harder to achieve than D-T fusion which requires "only" 100 million K.

**Discussion**

The $${}^{3}\text{He} + {}^{3}\text{He}$$ reaction requires such high temperatures because both nuclei carry charge +2e, creating a strong Coulomb barrier. D-T fusion is easier because the products (neutron and alpha) carry less initial charge to overcome. The 100-fold higher temperature requirement for He-3 fusion makes it impractical with current technology, though it remains attractive for future advanced fusion systems due to its lack of neutron production.
