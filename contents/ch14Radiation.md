</div>

You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the Sun. Similarly, you can
sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking
inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. The space between the Earth and the
Sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or
conduction. In these examples, heat is transferred by radiation. That is, the
hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin: no medium is
required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves,
infrared **radiation**, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma
rays.

![The figure shows a campfire. Some small logs are burning and the flames above them are visible against a dark background.](../resources/Figure_14_07_01.jpg 'Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light, although dramatic, transfers relatively little thermal energy. Convection transfers energy away from the observers as hot air rises, while conduction is negligibly slow here. Skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, so that you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (credit: Daniel X. O’Neil)')
{: #Figure1}

The energy of electromagnetic radiation depends on the wavelength (color) and
varies over a wide range: a smaller wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds
to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher temperatures, a
temperature change is accompanied by a color change. Take, for example, an
electrical element on a stove, which glows from red to orange, while the
higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white. The
radiation you feel is mostly infrared, which corresponds to a lower temperature
than that of the electrical element and the steel. The radiated energy depends
on its intensity, which is represented in the figure below by the height of the
distribution.

[Electromagnetic Waves](../contents/ch24ElectromagneticWaves) explains more about the electromagnetic
spectrum and [Introduction to Quantum Physics](../contents/ch29QuantumPhysics) discusses how the
decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.

![Figure a shows a graph of the intensity of electromagnetic radiation versus wavelength in nano meters. There are three curves on the graph labeled, from top to bottom, six thousand K, four thousand K, and three thousand K. The top curve peaks sharply at the beginning near about five hundred nano meters in what is labeled the visible range (violet to red). After the peak, this curve decays strongly by three thousand nano meters. The middle curve peaks more softly near nine hundred nano meters at a height about one third that of the first curve, and decays by three thousand nano meters. The lowest curve peaks very softly near one thousand nano meters curve and decreases slowly for higher wavelengths. The region between one thousand to two thousand nano meters is labeled the infrared range. Figure b shows two burners of a gas stove. One burner is closer and the other is in the background. The flame of the near burner is blue at the bottom and gradually changes to orange as you approach the top of the flame. The flame of the background burner is smaller and is essentially completely blue.](../resources/Figure_14_07_02.jpg '(a) A graph of the spectra of electromagnetic waves emitted from an ideal radiator at three different temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shaded portion denotes the visible part of the spectrum. It is apparent that the shift toward the ultraviolet with temperature makes the visible appearance shift from red to white to blue as temperature increases. (b) Note the variations in color corresponding to variations in flame temperature. (credit: Tuohirulla)')
{: #Figure2}

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat transfer
by radiation is largely determined by the color of the object. Black is the most
effective, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates
generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance (
see [[Equation 2]](#Equation2)). Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be
hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk on a summer day, because black absorbs better
than gray. The reverse is also true—black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a
clear summer night, the asphalt will be colder than the gray sidewalk, because
black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. An _ideal radiator_ is the
same color as an _ideal absorber_, and captures all the radiation that falls on
it. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and is also a poor radiator. A white
object reflects all radiation, like a mirror. (A perfect, polished white surface
is mirror-like in appearance, and a crushed mirror looks white.)

![The figure shows a close up of two sets of ice cubes. The ice on the left is on a light-colored pavement and is relatively unmelted. The ice on the right is on a darker pavement and is noticeably more melted.](../resources/Figure_14_07_03.jpg 'This illustration shows that the darker pavement is hotter than the lighter pavement (much more of the ice on the right has melted), although both have been in the sunlight for the same time. The thermal conductivities of the pavements are the same.')
{: #Figure3}

Gray objects have a uniform ability to absorb all parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Colored objects behave in similar but more complex ways, which gives
them a particular color in the visible range and may make them special in other
ranges of the nonvisible spectrum. Take, for example, the strong absorption of
infrared radiation by the skin, which allows us to be very sensitive to it.

![In the figure two black and two silver polished blocks are shown. Radiant energy is incident on the first black block. Most of the energy is absorbed and only a small amount is shown as reflected. On the second black block more of the energy from inside the block is emitted than is retained. On the first silver polished block the incident energy is mostly reflected and only a small portion is absorbed. On the second silver polished block the energy from inside is mostly retained and only a small amount of energy is emitted.](../resources/Figure_14_07_04.jpg 'A black object is a good absorber and a good radiator, while a white (or silver) object is a poor absorber and a poor radiator. It is as if radiation from the inside is reflected back into the silver object, whereas radiation from the inside of the black object is “absorbed” when it hits the surface and finds itself on the outside and is strongly emitted.')
{: #Figure4}

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the **
Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation**\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{Q}{t}=\sigma eA{T}^{4}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{J/s}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\cdot
{\text{K}}^{4} $$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$A $$ is the surface area
of the object, and $$T $$ is its absolute temperature in kelvin. The symbol $$e

$$
stands for the **emissivity** of the object, which is a measure of how well
it radiates. An ideal jet-black (or black body) radiator has $$e=1 $$ , whereas
a perfect reflector has $$e=0 $$ . Real objects fall between these two values.
Take, for example, tungsten light bulb filaments which have an $$e $$ of about
$$ 0.5 $$ , and carbon black (a material used in printer toner), which has the (
greatest known) emissivity of about $$0.99 $$.

The radiation rate is directly proportional to the *fourth power* of the
absolute temperature—a remarkably strong temperature dependence. Furthermore,
the radiated heat is proportional to the surface area of the object. If you
knock apart the coals of a fire, there is a noticeable increase in radiation due
to an increase in radiating surface area.

![A thermograph of part of a building is shown. The temperature variations are shown in different colors. The region near the windows is more yellowish green, with reddish frames, showing that the windows are major regions of radiative heat transfer.](../resources/Figure_14_07_05.jpg "A thermograph of part of a building shows temperature variations, indicating where heat transfer to the outside is most severe. Windows are a major region of heat transfer to the outside of homes. (credit: U.S. Army)")
{: #Figure5}

Skin is a remarkably good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an
emissivity of 0.97 in the infrared spectrum. Thus, we are all nearly (jet) black
in the infrared, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color. This high
infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is
also the basis for the use of night scopes used by law enforcement and the
military to detect human beings. Even small temperature variations can be
detected because of the $${T}^{4} $$ dependence. Images, called *thermographs*,
can be used medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the
body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect
heat leaks in homes [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), optimize performance of blast
furnaces, improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map the
Earth’s temperature profile.

All objects emit and absorb radiation. The *net* rate of heat transfer by
radiation (absorption minus emission) is related to both the temperature of the
object and the temperature of its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a
temperature $${T}_{1} $$ is surrounded by an environment with uniform
temperature $${T}_{2} $$ , the **net rate of heat transfer by radiation** is

<div id="Equation2" class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {Q}_{\text{net}}}{t}=\sigma eA\left({T}_{2}^{4}-{T}_{1}^{4}\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$e $$ is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not
matter whether the surroundings are white, gray, or black; the balance of
radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs
radiation. When $${T}_{2}>{T}_{1} $$ , the quantity $${Q}_{\text{net}}/t $$ is
positive; that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

Calculate the Net Heat Transfer of a Person: Heat Transfer by Radiation

What is the rate of heat transfer by radiation, with an unclothed person standing in a dark room whose ambient temperature is  $$ 22.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 The person has a normal skin temperature of  $$ 33.0\text{ºC} $$
 and a surface area of  $$ 1.50 {\text{m}}^{2} $$ .
 The emissivity of skin is 0.97 in the infrared, where the radiation takes place.

**Strategy**

We can solve this by using the equation for the rate of radiative heat transfer.

**Solution**

Insert the temperatures values $${T}_{2}=295 \text{K} $$ and $${T}_{1}=306

 $$=-99\text{J/s}=-99 \text{W} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the
minus sign), considering that a person at rest may produce energy at the rate of
125 W and that conduction and convection will also be transferring energy to the
environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing
significantly reduces heat transfer to the environment by many methods, because
clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a lower emissivity (
especially if it is white) than skin.

</div>

The Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects
some of it back into outer space. Because the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the
net energy flux is from the Sun to the Earth. However, the rate of energy
transfer is less than the equation for the radiative heat transfer would predict
because the Sun does not fill the sky. The average emissivity ( $$e $$ )
of the Earth is about 0.65, but the calculation of this value is complicated by
the fact that the highly reflective cloud coverage varies greatly from day to
day. There is a negative feedback (one in which a change produces an effect that
opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; greater temperatures
evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into
space, reducing the temperature. The often mentioned **greenhouse effect** is
directly related to the variation of the Earth’s emissivity with radiation
type (see the figure given below). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon
responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth. The Earth’s
relatively constant temperature is a result of the energy balance between the
incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the
infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide (
$${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ )
and water ( $${\text{H}}_{2}\text{O} $$ )
in the atmosphere and then re-radiated back to the Earth or into outer space.
Re-radiation back to the Earth maintains its surface temperature about
$$40\text{ºC} $$ higher than it would be if there was no atmosphere, similar to
the way glass increases temperatures in a greenhouse.

The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially, their heat retention. She discovered that the $${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays" included conclusions that an atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.

![A drawing of a portion of the Earth’s surface is shown, with both ocean and continents visible. Different rays such as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared are shown penetrating the atmosphere and impinging on the Earth’s surface. Infrared rays re-emitted by the Earth’s surface are trapped by the atmosphere of the Earth and are scattered back to the Earth.](../resources/Figure_14_07_06.jpg 'The greenhouse effect is a name given to the trapping of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere by a process similar to that used in greenhouses. The atmosphere, like window glass, is transparent to incoming visible radiation and most of the Sun’s infrared. These wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted as infrared. Since Earth’s temperature is much lower than that of the Sun, the infrared radiated by the Earth has a much longer wavelength. The atmosphere, like glass, traps these longer infrared rays, keeping the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. The amount of trapping depends on concentrations of trace gases like carbon dioxide, and a change in the concentration of these gases is believed to affect the Earth’s surface temperature.')
{: #Figure6}

The greenhouse effect is also central to the discussion of global warming due to
emission of carbon dioxide and methane (and other so-called greenhouse gases)
into the Earth’s atmosphere from industrial production and farming. Changes in
global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (
affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea
levels.

Heating and cooling are often significant contributors to energy use in
individual homes. Mária Telkes, a Hungarian-born American scientist, was among the foremost developers of solar energy applications in industrial and community use. After inventing a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts, she partnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power. Air warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use. Telkes later worked with the Department of Energy to develop the first solar-electrically powered home. Current research efforts into developing environmentally
friendly homes quite often focus on reducing conventional heating and cooling
through better building materials, strategically positioning windows to optimize
radiation gain from the Sun, and opening spaces to allow convection. It is
possible to build a zero-energy house that allows for comfortable living in most
parts of the United States with hot and humid summers and cold winters.

![A solar cooker is shown. There is a pot of food inside the solar cooker. The sunlight is incident on the solar cooker and the food is being cooked.](../resources/Figure_14_07_08.jpg 'This simple but effective solar cooker uses the greenhouse effect and reflective material to trap and retain solar energy. Made of inexpensive, durable materials, it saves money and labor, and is of particular economic value in energy-poor developing countries. (credit: E.B. Kauai)')
{: #Figure7}

Conversely, dark space is very cold, about $$3 \text{K}\left(-454 \text{ºF}
\right) $$ , so that the Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. Owing to the
fact that clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they
reflect some of the radiation back to the surface, greatly reducing heat
transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the
atmosphere during the day. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can
be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm
latitudes.

### Summary

- Radiation is the rate of heat transfer through the emission or absorption of
  electromagnetic waves.
- The rate of heat transfer depends on the surface area and the fourth power of
  the absolute temperature:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{Q}{t}=\sigma eA{T}^{4}\text{,} $$
  </div>

where $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{J/s}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\cdot
{\text{K}}^{4} $$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $$e $$ is the emissivity
of the body. For a black body, $$e=1 $$ whereas a shiny white or perfect
reflector has $$e=0 $$ , with real objects having values of $$e $$ between 1 and 0. The net rate of heat transfer by radiation is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{ {Q}_{\text{net}}}{t}=\sigma eA\left({T}_{2}^{4}-{T}_{1}^{4}\right) $$
  </div>

where $${T}_{1} $$ is the temperature of an object surrounded by an environment
with uniform temperature $${T}_{2} $$ and $$e $$ is the emissivity of the _object_.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
At what net rate does heat radiate from a  $$275{\text{-m}}^{2} $$
 black roof on a night when the roof's temperature is  $$30.0\text{ºC} $$
 and the surrounding temperature is  $$15.0\text{ºC} $$ ?
 The emissivity of the roof is 0.900.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problem-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation between two surfaces: $$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_2^4 - T_1^4)$$. The roof (at higher temperature) radiates energy to the cooler surroundings. We must convert temperatures to Kelvin.

**Solution**

Given:
- Roof area: $$A = 275 \text{ m}^2$$
- Roof temperature: $$T_{roof} = 30.0\text{ºC} = 303 \text{ K}$$
- Surrounding temperature: $$T_{surr} = 15.0\text{ºC} = 288 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.900$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$

Net radiation rate (heat loss from roof):
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_{roof}^4 - T_{surr}^4)$$
</div>

Calculate the fourth powers:
- $$T_{roof}^4 = (303)^4 = 8.424 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$
- $$T_{surr}^4 = (288)^4 = 6.872 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.900)(275)[(8.424 - 6.872) \times 10^9]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (1.402 \times 10^{-5})(1.552 \times 10^9) = 21,759 \text{ W} \approx 21.8 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

Since the roof is losing heat to cooler surroundings, we can express this as:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = -21.7 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

The negative sign indicates heat loss from the roof.

**Discussion**

The heat loss rate of 21.7 kW is substantial—equivalent to running about 22 space heaters continuously! This demonstrates why radiation is a significant mechanism of heat loss from buildings, especially:

1. **At night**: The roof radiates to the cooler night sky
2. **With large surface areas**: The 275 m² roof provides significant area for radiation
3. **With dark surfaces**: The high emissivity (0.900) means the roof is an efficient radiator

Even though the temperature difference is only 15°C (relatively modest), the large area and high emissivity result in substantial heat loss. This is why:

- **Cool roofs** (light-colored, reflective roofs) are increasingly used in warm climates—they have low emissivity and absorb/emit less radiation
- **Radiant barriers** in attics can reduce radiative heat transfer
- **Proper insulation** is crucial—this 21.7 kW must be replaced by heating systems in winter or represents heat gain that must be removed by cooling in summer

The calculation demonstrates **radiative cooling**: on clear nights, surfaces can radiate heat to the cold upper atmosphere and may even reach temperatures below the ambient air temperature. This is why frost can form on car windshields even when air temperature is above freezing.

For a typical house:
- Roof area: 150-300 m²
- This roof's heat loss: 21.7 kW
- Cost impact: At $0.10/kWh electricity, running 24h = $52/day heating cost just to offset roof radiation!

This underscores the importance of insulation, which doesn't stop radiation but reduces the overall heat transfer through the roof structure.

**Answer**

The net rate of heat radiation from the roof is **-21.7 kW** (negative indicating heat loss to the surroundings).

**Strategy**

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation: $$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_2^4 - T_1^4)$$. Since only 50% enters the room, we multiply the result by 0.50. Remember to convert temperatures to Kelvin.

**Solution**

Given:
- Embers temperature: $$T_{embers} = 850\text{ºC} = 1123 \text{ K}$$

</div>

**(b)** Yes, absolutely! The radiation alone transfers 8.80 kW into the room, which is substantial. For comparison:
- A typical space heater produces 1-2 kW
- This radiation is equivalent to 4-9 space heaters

This strongly supports that radiation is the dominant heat transfer mechanism from a fireplace. Convection through the chimney actually removes hot air from the room, making traditional fireplaces relatively inefficient for heating. However, the radiant heat creates a pleasant warming sensation for people in direct view of the fire, even though the room temperature may not rise significantly.

**Discussion**

The huge radiative power (17.6 kW total, 8.8 kW into room) demonstrates why:
1. You can feel intense heat from across a room when near a fireplace
2. Objects in line-of-sight with embers warm quickly
3. Fireplaces can be uncomfortably hot when sitting close
4. The fourth-power temperature dependence makes hot embers incredibly effective radiators

The cherry-red color indicates temperatures around 850ºC, confirming significant visible light emission. However, most radiated energy is still in the infrared (which we feel as heat but cannot see). The Stefan-Boltzmann law's $$T^4$$ dependence means the 1123 K embers radiate about $(1123/291)^4 \approx 230$ times more power per unit area than room-temperature objects.

Modern fireplace inserts and stoves capture more of this heat through convection and conduction, making them much more efficient than open fireplaces where most heat escapes up the chimney.

**Answer**

(a) The net rate of radiant heat transfer into the room is **8.80 kW**.
(b) Yes, this demonstrates that **radiation is the dominant mechanism** for heat transfer from a fireplace into a room.

 and the efficiency of automobile engines as 25%.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation. For part (b), we calculate the waste heat produced by the engine (75% of input power) and compare it to the radiative heat transfer.

**Solution**

Given:
- Radiator temperature: $$T_1 = 110\text{ºC} = 383 \text{ K}$$
- Environment temperature: $$T_2 = 50.0\text{ºC} = 323 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.750$$
- Surface area: $$A = 1.20 \text{ m}^2$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$
- Engine power output: $$P_{out} = 200 \text{ hp} = 1.5 \times 10^5 \text{ W} = 150 \text{ kW}$$
- Engine efficiency: $$\eta = 25\% = 0.25$$

**(a)** Net radiation rate:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$
</div>

Calculate fourth powers:
- $$T_1^4 = (383)^4 = 2.150 \times 10^{10} \text{ K}^4$$
- $$T_2^4 = (323)^4 = 1.086 \times 10^{10} \text{ K}^4$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.750)(1.20)(2.150 - 1.086) \times 10^{10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.10 \times 10^{-8})(1.064 \times 10^{10}) = 543 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate engine waste heat:

If efficiency is 25%, then 75% of input power becomes waste heat.
Input power: $$P_{in} = \frac{P_{out}}{\eta} = \frac{150 \text{ kW}}{0.25} = 600 \text{ kW}$$

Waste heat: $$P_{waste} = P_{in} - P_{out} = 600 - 150 = 450 \text{ kW}$$

Fraction of waste heat removed by radiation:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{543 \text{ W}}{450,000 \text{ W}} = 0.00121 = 0.121\%$$
</div>

No, radiative heat transfer is **not significant**—it represents only about 0.12% of the waste heat that must be removed.

**Discussion**

The calculation reveals why car radiators rely overwhelmingly on **convection**, not radiation:

**(a)** The radiative heat transfer of only 543 W is relatively small. This occurs because:
1. The temperature difference is modest (60ºC)
2. The fourth-power dependence means moderate temperatures radiate weakly compared to very hot objects
3. The emissivity (0.75) is good but not perfect

**(b)** The engine produces 450 kW of waste heat—the radiation removes only 0.12% of it! The vast majority of cooling comes from:
- **Forced convection:** Coolant (water/antifreeze mixture) circulating through the engine
- **Air flow:** Fan-driven or motion-induced air flowing through radiator fins
- **Conduction:** Heat transfer from coolant to radiator metal to air

This is why:
- Radiators have many thin fins (maximizing surface area for convection)
- Coolant must circulate continuously
- Fans are essential when the car isn't moving
- Overheating occurs rapidly if coolant stops circulating

A stationary car with the engine running will overheat in minutes without functioning coolant circulation and fans, proving that radiation alone is utterly inadequate for cooling. The term "radiator" is actually a misnomer—it should be called a "convector"!

**Answer**

(a) The rate of radiative heat transfer is **543 W** or approximately **0.54 kW**.
(b) No, this is **not significant**—it represents only **0.12%** of the engine's waste heat. The radiator relies primarily on **convection** for cooling.
