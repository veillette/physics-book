You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the Sun. Similarly, you can
sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking
inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. The space between the Earth and the
Sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or
conduction. In these examples, heat is transferred by radiation. That is, the
hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin: no medium is
required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves,
infrared **radiation**, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma
rays.

![The figure shows a campfire. Some small logs are burning and the flames above them are visible against a dark background.](../resources/Figure_14_07_01.jpg 'Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light, although dramatic, transfers relatively little thermal energy. Convection transfers energy away from the observers as hot air rises, while conduction is negligibly slow here. Skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, so that you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (credit: Daniel X. O’Neil)')
{: #Figure1}

The energy of electromagnetic radiation depends on the wavelength (color) and
varies over a wide range: a smaller wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds
to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher temperatures, a
temperature change is accompanied by a color change. Take, for example, an
electrical element on a stove, which glows from red to orange, while the
higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white. The
radiation you feel is mostly infrared, which corresponds to a lower temperature
than that of the electrical element and the steel. The radiated energy depends
on its intensity, which is represented in the figure below by the height of the
distribution.

[Electromagnetic Waves](../contents/ch24ElectromagneticWaves) explains more about the electromagnetic
spectrum and [Introduction to Quantum Physics](../contents/ch29QuantumPhysics) discusses how the
decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.

![Figure a shows a graph of the intensity of electromagnetic radiation versus wavelength in nano meters. There are three curves on the graph labeled, from top to bottom, six thousand K, four thousand K, and three thousand K. The top curve peaks sharply at the beginning near about five hundred nano meters in what is labeled the visible range (violet to red). After the peak, this curve decays strongly by three thousand nano meters. The middle curve peaks more softly near nine hundred nano meters at a height about one third that of the first curve, and decays by three thousand nano meters. The lowest curve peaks very softly near one thousand nano meters curve and decreases slowly for higher wavelengths. The region between one thousand to two thousand nano meters is labeled the infrared range. Figure b shows two burners of a gas stove. One burner is closer and the other is in the background. The flame of the near burner is blue at the bottom and gradually changes to orange as you approach the top of the flame. The flame of the background burner is smaller and is essentially completely blue.](../resources/Figure_14_07_02.jpg '(a) A graph of the spectra of electromagnetic waves emitted from an ideal radiator at three different temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shaded portion denotes the visible part of the spectrum. It is apparent that the shift toward the ultraviolet with temperature makes the visible appearance shift from red to white to blue as temperature increases. (b) Note the variations in color corresponding to variations in flame temperature. (credit: Tuohirulla)')
{: #Figure2}

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat transfer
by radiation is largely determined by the color of the object. Black is the most
effective, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates
generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance (
see [[Equation 2]](#Equation2)). Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be
hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk on a summer day, because black absorbs better
than gray. The reverse is also true—black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a
clear summer night, the asphalt will be colder than the gray sidewalk, because
black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. An _ideal radiator_ is the
same color as an _ideal absorber_, and captures all the radiation that falls on
it. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and is also a poor radiator. A white
object reflects all radiation, like a mirror. (A perfect, polished white surface
is mirror-like in appearance, and a crushed mirror looks white.)

![The figure shows a close up of two sets of ice cubes. The ice on the left is on a light-colored pavement and is relatively unmelted. The ice on the right is on a darker pavement and is noticeably more melted.](../resources/Figure_14_07_03.jpg 'This illustration shows that the darker pavement is hotter than the lighter pavement (much more of the ice on the right has melted), although both have been in the sunlight for the same time. The thermal conductivities of the pavements are the same.')
{: #Figure3}

Gray objects have a uniform ability to absorb all parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Colored objects behave in similar but more complex ways, which gives
them a particular color in the visible range and may make them special in other
ranges of the nonvisible spectrum. Take, for example, the strong absorption of
infrared radiation by the skin, which allows us to be very sensitive to it.

![In the figure two black and two silver polished blocks are shown. Radiant energy is incident on the first black block. Most of the energy is absorbed and only a small amount is shown as reflected. On the second black block more of the energy from inside the block is emitted than is retained. On the first silver polished block the incident energy is mostly reflected and only a small portion is absorbed. On the second silver polished block the energy from inside is mostly retained and only a small amount of energy is emitted.](../resources/Figure_14_07_04.jpg 'A black object is a good absorber and a good radiator, while a white (or silver) object is a poor absorber and a poor radiator. It is as if radiation from the inside is reflected back into the silver object, whereas radiation from the inside of the black object is “absorbed” when it hits the surface and finds itself on the outside and is strongly emitted.')
{: #Figure4}

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the **
Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation**\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{Q}{t}=\sigma eA{T}^{4}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{J/s}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\cdot {\text{K}}^{4} $$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$A $$ is the surface area
of the object, and $$T $$ is its absolute temperature in kelvin. The symbol $$e $$
stands for the **emissivity** of the object, which is a measure of how well
it radiates. An ideal jet-black (or black body) radiator has $$e=1 $$ , whereas
a perfect reflector has $$e=0 $$ . Real objects fall between these two values.
Take, for example, tungsten light bulb filaments which have an $$e $$ of about
$$ 0.5 $$ , and carbon black (a material used in printer toner), which has the (
greatest known) emissivity of about $$0.99 $$.

The radiation rate is directly proportional to the *fourth power* of the
absolute temperature—a remarkably strong temperature dependence. Furthermore,
the radiated heat is proportional to the surface area of the object. If you
knock apart the coals of a fire, there is a noticeable increase in radiation due
to an increase in radiating surface area.

![A thermograph of part of a building is shown. The temperature variations are shown in different colors. The region near the windows is more yellowish green, with reddish frames, showing that the windows are major regions of radiative heat transfer.](../resources/Figure_14_07_05.jpg "A thermograph of part of a building shows temperature variations, indicating where heat transfer to the outside is most severe. Windows are a major region of heat transfer to the outside of homes. (credit: U.S. Army)")
{: #Figure5}

Skin is a remarkably good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an
emissivity of 0.97 in the infrared spectrum. Thus, we are all nearly (jet) black
in the infrared, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color. This high
infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is
also the basis for the use of night scopes used by law enforcement and the
military to detect human beings. Even small temperature variations can be
detected because of the $${T}^{4} $$ dependence. Images, called *thermographs*,
can be used medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the
body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect
heat leaks in homes [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), optimize performance of blast
furnaces, improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map the
Earth’s temperature profile.

All objects emit and absorb radiation. The *net* rate of heat transfer by
radiation (absorption minus emission) is related to both the temperature of the
object and the temperature of its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a
temperature $${T}_{1} $$ is surrounded by an environment with uniform
temperature $${T}_{2} $$ , the **net rate of heat transfer by radiation** is

<div id="Equation2" class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {Q}_{\text{net}}}{t}=\sigma eA\left({T}_{2}^{4}-{T}_{1}^{4}\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$e $$ is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not
matter whether the surroundings are white, gray, or black; the balance of
radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs
radiation. When $${T}_{2}>{T}_{1} $$ , the quantity $${Q}_{\text{net}}/t $$ is
positive; that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

Calculate the Net Heat Transfer of a Person: Heat Transfer by Radiation
</div>
What is the rate of heat transfer by radiation, with an unclothed person standing in a dark room whose ambient temperature is  $$ 22.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 The person has a normal skin temperature of  $$ 33.0\text{ºC} $$
 and a surface area of  $$ 1.50 {\text{m}}^{2} $$ .
 The emissivity of skin is 0.97 in the infrared, where the radiation takes place.

**Strategy**

We can solve this by using the equation for the rate of radiative heat transfer.

**Solution**

Insert the temperatures values $${T}_{2}=295 \text{K} $$ and $${T}_{1}=306 \text{K} $$ , so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{Q}{t}=\sigma eA\left({T}_{2}^{4}-{T}_{1}^{4}\right) $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
$$=\left( 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{J/s}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\cdot {\text{K}}^{4} \right)
\left( 0.97 \right) \left( 1.50 {\text{m}}^{2} \right)
\left[ { \left(295\text{K}\right)}^{4}-{ \left(306 \text{K}\right) }^{4} \right]
=-99\text{J/s}=-99 \text{W} \text{.}$$
</div>
**Discussion**

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the
minus sign), considering that a person at rest may produce energy at the rate of
125 W and that conduction and convection will also be transferring energy to the
environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing
significantly reduces heat transfer to the environment by many methods, because
clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a lower emissivity (
especially if it is white) than skin.

</div>

The Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects
some of it back into outer space. Because the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the
net energy flux is from the Sun to the Earth. However, the rate of energy
transfer is less than the equation for the radiative heat transfer would predict
because the Sun does not fill the sky. The average emissivity ( $$e $$ )
of the Earth is about 0.65, but the calculation of this value is complicated by
the fact that the highly reflective cloud coverage varies greatly from day to
day. There is a negative feedback (one in which a change produces an effect that
opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; greater temperatures
evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into
space, reducing the temperature. The often mentioned **greenhouse effect** is
directly related to the variation of the Earth’s emissivity with radiation
type (see the figure given below). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon
responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth. The Earth’s
relatively constant temperature is a result of the energy balance between the
incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the
infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide (
$${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ )
and water ( $${\text{H}}_{2}\text{O} $$ )
in the atmosphere and then re-radiated back to the Earth or into outer space.
Re-radiation back to the Earth maintains its surface temperature about
$$40\text{ºC} $$ higher than it would be if there was no atmosphere, similar to
the way glass increases temperatures in a greenhouse.

The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially, their heat retention. She discovered that the $${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays" included conclusions that an atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.

![A drawing of a portion of the Earth’s surface is shown, with both ocean and continents visible. Different rays such as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared are shown penetrating the atmosphere and impinging on the Earth’s surface. Infrared rays re-emitted by the Earth’s surface are trapped by the atmosphere of the Earth and are scattered back to the Earth.](../resources/Figure_14_07_06.jpg 'The greenhouse effect is a name given to the trapping of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere by a process similar to that used in greenhouses. The atmosphere, like window glass, is transparent to incoming visible radiation and most of the Sun’s infrared. These wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted as infrared. Since Earth’s temperature is much lower than that of the Sun, the infrared radiated by the Earth has a much longer wavelength. The atmosphere, like glass, traps these longer infrared rays, keeping the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. The amount of trapping depends on concentrations of trace gases like carbon dioxide, and a change in the concentration of these gases is believed to affect the Earth’s surface temperature.')
{: #Figure6}

The greenhouse effect is also central to the discussion of global warming due to
emission of carbon dioxide and methane (and other so-called greenhouse gases)
into the Earth’s atmosphere from industrial production and farming. Changes in
global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (
affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea
levels.

Heating and cooling are often significant contributors to energy use in
individual homes. Mária Telkes, a Hungarian-born American scientist, was among the foremost developers of solar energy applications in industrial and community use. After inventing a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts, she partnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power. Air warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use. Telkes later worked with the Department of Energy to develop the first solar-electrically powered home. Current research efforts into developing environmentally
friendly homes quite often focus on reducing conventional heating and cooling
through better building materials, strategically positioning windows to optimize
radiation gain from the Sun, and opening spaces to allow convection. It is
possible to build a zero-energy house that allows for comfortable living in most
parts of the United States with hot and humid summers and cold winters.

![A solar cooker is shown. There is a pot of food inside the solar cooker. The sunlight is incident on the solar cooker and the food is being cooked.](../resources/Figure_14_07_08.jpg 'This simple but effective solar cooker uses the greenhouse effect and reflective material to trap and retain solar energy. Made of inexpensive, durable materials, it saves money and labor, and is of particular economic value in energy-poor developing countries. (credit: E.B. Kauai)')
{: #Figure7}

Conversely, dark space is very cold, about $$3 \text{K}\left(-454 \text{ºF} \right) $$ , so that the Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. Owing to the
fact that clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they
reflect some of the radiation back to the surface, greatly reducing heat
transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the
atmosphere during the day. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can
be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm
latitudes.

### Summary

- Radiation is the rate of heat transfer through the emission or absorption of
  electromagnetic waves.
- The rate of heat transfer depends on the surface area and the fourth power of
  the absolute temperature:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{Q}{t}=\sigma eA{T}^{4}\text{,} $$
  </div>

where $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{J/s}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\cdot {\text{K}}^{4} $$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $$e $$ is the emissivity
of the body. For a black body, $$e=1 $$ whereas a shiny white or perfect
reflector has $$e=0 $$ , with real objects having values of $$e $$ between 1 and 0. The net rate of heat transfer by radiation is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{ {Q}_{\text{net}}}{t}=\sigma eA\left({T}_{2}^{4}-{T}_{1}^{4}\right) $$
  </div>

where $${T}_{1} $$ is the temperature of an object surrounded by an environment
with uniform temperature $${T}_{2} $$ and $$e $$ is the emissivity of the _object_.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
At what net rate does heat radiate from a  $$275{\text{-m}}^{2} $$
 black roof on a night when the roof's temperature is  $$30.0\text{ºC} $$
 and the surrounding temperature is  $$15.0\text{ºC} $$ ?
 The emissivity of the roof is 0.900.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problem-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation between two surfaces: $$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_2^4 - T_1^4)$$. The roof (at higher temperature) radiates energy to the cooler surroundings. We must convert temperatures to Kelvin.

**Solution**

Given:
- Roof area: $$A = 275 \text{ m}^2$$
- Roof temperature: $$T_{roof} = 30.0\text{ºC} = 303 \text{ K}$$
- Surrounding temperature: $$T_{surr} = 15.0\text{ºC} = 288 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.900$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$

Net radiation rate (heat loss from roof):
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_{roof}^4 - T_{surr}^4)$$
</div>

Calculate the fourth powers:
- $$T_{roof}^4 = (303)^4 = 8.424 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$
- $$T_{surr}^4 = (288)^4 = 6.872 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.900)(275)[(8.424 - 6.872) \times 10^9]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (1.402 \times 10^{-5})(1.552 \times 10^9) = 21,759 \text{ W} \approx 21.8 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

Since the roof is losing heat to cooler surroundings, we can express this as:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = -21.7 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

The negative sign indicates heat loss from the roof.

**Discussion**

The heat loss rate of 21.7 kW is substantial—equivalent to running about 22 space heaters continuously! This demonstrates why radiation is a significant mechanism of heat loss from buildings, especially:

1. **At night**: The roof radiates to the cooler night sky
2. **With large surface areas**: The 275 m² roof provides significant area for radiation
3. **With dark surfaces**: The high emissivity (0.900) means the roof is an efficient radiator

Even though the temperature difference is only 15°C (relatively modest), the large area and high emissivity result in substantial heat loss. This is why:

- **Cool roofs** (light-colored, reflective roofs) are increasingly used in warm climates—they have low emissivity and absorb/emit less radiation
- **Radiant barriers** in attics can reduce radiative heat transfer
- **Proper insulation** is crucial—this 21.7 kW must be replaced by heating systems in winter or represents heat gain that must be removed by cooling in summer

The calculation demonstrates **radiative cooling**: on clear nights, surfaces can radiate heat to the cold upper atmosphere and may even reach temperatures below the ambient air temperature. This is why frost can form on car windshields even when air temperature is above freezing.

For a typical house:
- Roof area: 150-300 m²
- This roof's heat loss: 21.7 kW
- Cost impact: At \$0.10/kWh electricity, running 24h = \$52/day heating cost just to offset roof radiation!

This underscores the importance of insulation, which doesn't stop radiation but reduces the overall heat transfer through the roof structure.

**Answer**

The net rate of heat radiation from the roof is **-21.7 kW** (negative indicating heat loss to the surroundings).

**Strategy**

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation: $$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_2^4 - T_1^4)$$. Since only 50% enters the room, we multiply the result by 0.50. Remember to convert temperatures to Kelvin.

**Solution**

Given:
- Embers temperature: $$T_{embers} = 850\text{ºC} = 1123 \text{ K}$$

$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (1.112 \times 10^{-8})(1.585 \times 10^{12}) = 17,600 \text{ W}$$

**(b)** Yes, absolutely! The radiation alone transfers 8.80 kW into the room, which is substantial. For comparison:
- A typical space heater produces 1-2 kW
- This radiation is equivalent to 4-9 space heaters

This strongly supports that radiation is the dominant heat transfer mechanism from a fireplace. Convection through the chimney actually removes hot air from the room, making traditional fireplaces relatively inefficient for heating. However, the radiant heat creates a pleasant warming sensation for people in direct view of the fire, even though the room temperature may not rise significantly.

**Discussion**

The huge radiative power (17.6 kW total, 8.8 kW into room) demonstrates why:
1. You can feel intense heat from across a room when near a fireplace
2. Objects in line-of-sight with embers warm quickly
3. Fireplaces can be uncomfortably hot when sitting close
4. The fourth-power temperature dependence makes hot embers incredibly effective radiators

The cherry-red color indicates temperatures around 850ºC, confirming significant visible light emission. However, most radiated energy is still in the infrared (which we feel as heat but cannot see). The Stefan-Boltzmann law's $$T^4$$ dependence means the 1123 K embers radiate about $(1123/291)^4 \approx 230$ times more power per unit area than room-temperature objects.

Modern fireplace inserts and stoves capture more of this heat through convection and conduction, making them much more efficient than open fireplaces where most heat escapes up the chimney.

**Answer**

(a) The net rate of radiant heat transfer into the room is **8.80 kW**.
(b) Yes, this demonstrates that **radiation is the dominant mechanism** for heat transfer from a fireplace into a room.

<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation. For part (b), we calculate the waste heat produced by the engine (75% of input power) and compare it to the radiative heat transfer.

**Solution**

Given:
- Radiator temperature: $$T_1 = 110\text{ºC} = 383 \text{ K}$$
- Environment temperature: $$T_2 = 50.0\text{ºC} = 323 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.750$$
- Surface area: $$A = 1.20 \text{ m}^2$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$
- Engine power output: $$P_{out} = 200 \text{ hp} = 1.5 \times 10^5 \text{ W} = 150 \text{ kW}$$
- Engine efficiency: $$\eta = 25\% = 0.25$$

**(a)** Net radiation rate:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = \sigma eA(T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$
</div>

Calculate fourth powers:
- $$T_1^4 = (383)^4 = 2.150 \times 10^{10} \text{ K}^4$$
- $$T_2^4 = (323)^4 = 1.086 \times 10^{10} \text{ K}^4$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.750)(1.20)(2.150 - 1.086) \times 10^{10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{net}}{t} = (5.10 \times 10^{-8})(1.064 \times 10^{10}) = 543 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate engine waste heat:

If efficiency is 25%, then 75% of input power becomes waste heat.
Input power: $$P_{in} = \frac{P_{out}}{\eta} = \frac{150 \text{ kW}}{0.25} = 600 \text{ kW}$$

Waste heat: $$P_{waste} = P_{in} - P_{out} = 600 - 150 = 450 \text{ kW}$$

Fraction of waste heat removed by radiation:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{543 \text{ W}}{450,000 \text{ W}} = 0.00121 = 0.121\%$$
</div>

No, radiative heat transfer is **not significant**—it represents only about 0.12% of the waste heat that must be removed.

**Discussion**

The calculation reveals why car radiators rely overwhelmingly on **convection**, not radiation:

**(a)** The radiative heat transfer of only 543 W is relatively small. This occurs because:
1. The temperature difference is modest (60ºC)
2. The fourth-power dependence means moderate temperatures radiate weakly compared to very hot objects
3. The emissivity (0.75) is good but not perfect

**(b)** The engine produces 450 kW of waste heat—the radiation removes only 0.12% of it! The vast majority of cooling comes from:
- **Forced convection:** Coolant (water/antifreeze mixture) circulating through the engine
- **Air flow:** Fan-driven or motion-induced air flowing through radiator fins
- **Conduction:** Heat transfer from coolant to radiator metal to air

This is why:
- Radiators have many thin fins (maximizing surface area for convection)
- Coolant must circulate continuously
- Fans are essential when the car isn't moving
- Overheating occurs rapidly if coolant stops circulating

A stationary car with the engine running will overheat in minutes without functioning coolant circulation and fans, proving that radiation alone is utterly inadequate for cooling. The term "radiator" is actually a misnomer—it should be called a "convector"!

**Answer**

(a) The rate of radiative heat transfer is **543 W** or approximately **0.54 kW**.
(b) No, this is **not significant**—it represents only **0.12%** of the engine's waste heat. The radiator relies primarily on **convection** for cooling.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation: $$Q/t = \sigma eA(T_2^4 - T_1^4)$$, where $$T_2$$ is the ambient temperature and $$T_1$$ is the skin temperature (both in Kelvin). For part (b), we use $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ to find the rate of temperature increase.

**Solution**

Given:
- Ambient temperature: $$T_{ambient} = 50.0\text{ºC} = 323.15 \text{ K}$$
- Skin temperature: $$T_{skin} = 37.0\text{ºC} = 310.15 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.98$$
- Surface area: $$A = 1.50 \text{ m}^2$$
- Mass: $$m = 75.0 \text{ kg}$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$
- Specific heat of human body: $$c = 3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

**(a)** Rate of heat transfer by radiation:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \sigma e A(T_{ambient}^4 - T_{skin}^4)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.98)(1.50)[(323.15)^4 - (310.15)^4]$$
</div>

Calculate the temperature powers:
- $$(323.15)^4 = 1.0903 \times 10^{10} \text{ K}^4$$
- $$(310.15)^4 = 9.245 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$
- Difference: $$1.0903 \times 10^{10} - 9.245 \times 10^9 = 1.658 \times 10^9 \text{ K}^4$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.98)(1.50)(1.658 \times 10^9) = 138 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**(b)** Rate of body temperature increase:

From $$Q = mc\Delta T$$, the rate of temperature change is:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = \frac{Q/t}{mc} = \frac{138}{(75.0)(3500)} = \frac{138}{262500} = 5.26 \times 10^{-4} \text{ ºC/s}$$
</div>

Converting to more practical units:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = (5.26 \times 10^{-4} \text{ ºC/s})(60 \text{ s/min}) = 0.0316 \text{ ºC/min}$$
</div>

Or approximately:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = 1.9 \text{ ºC/hour}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

**(a)** The body absorbs heat at a rate of 138 W from the hot sauna environment through radiation alone. This is significant—comparable to a moderate-powered light bulb. Since the sauna is hotter than your skin, you receive net heat transfer.

**(b)** The rate of temperature increase of approximately 0.03ºC/min or 1.9ºC/hour seems reasonable for a sauna. In reality:
- You wouldn't stay in a sauna long enough for your core temperature to rise dangerously
- Your body activates cooling mechanisms (sweating) very quickly
- Evaporative cooling from sweat can remove much more than 138 W
- Convection also plays a significant role in heat transfer

A typical sauna session lasts 10-20 minutes. At 0.03ºC/min, this would only raise body temperature by 0.3-0.6ºC if other heat transfer mechanisms were truly balanced, which is manageable. However, the problem states "all other forms of heat transfer are balanced," which is unrealistic—in practice, you'd sweat profusely to dissipate this heat and maintain homeostasis.

This calculation demonstrates why saunas are uncomfortable but tolerable: while you gain heat through radiation (and convection), your body can compensate through evaporative cooling. If you couldn't sweat, a sauna would quickly become dangerous.

**Answer**

(a) The rate of heat transfer by radiation is approximately **138 W**.
(b) The body temperature would increase at a rate of **5.26 × 10⁻⁴ ºC/s**, or **0.032 ºC/min**, or approximately **1.9 ºC/hour**.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use Stefan-Boltzmann law $$P = \sigma eA T^4$$ and solve for $$T$$. Since $$T_{space} = 3$$ K is negligible compared to the Sun's temperature, we can ignore it. For part (b), we divide total power by surface area. For part (c), we use the inverse square law—power spreads over a sphere at Earth's distance.

**Solution**

Given:
- Sun's radius: $$R_s = 7.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m}$$
- Total power radiated: $$P = 3.80 \times 10^{26} \text{ W}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 1.00$$
- Space temperature: $$T_{space} = 3 \text{ K}$$ (negligible)
- Earth's orbital radius: $$R_E = 1.50 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$

**(a)** Surface temperature of the Sun:

Surface area of Sun:
<div class="equation">
$$A_s = 4\pi R_s^2 = 4\pi(7.00 \times 10^8)^2 = 6.16 \times 10^{18} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

Using Stefan-Boltzmann law:
<div class="equation">
$$P = \sigma e A_s T^4$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$T^4 = \frac{P}{\sigma e A_s} = \frac{3.80 \times 10^{26}}{(5.67 \times 10^{-8})(1.00)(6.16 \times 10^{18})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$T^4 = \frac{3.80 \times 10^{26}}{3.49 \times 10^{11}} = 1.089 \times 10^{15} \text{ K}^4$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$T = (1.089 \times 10^{15})^{1/4} = 5760 \text{ K}$$

**(b)** Power per square meter at Sun's surface:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{P}{A_s} = \frac{3.80 \times 10^{26}}{6.16 \times 10^{18}} = 6.17 \times 10^7 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

Or using Stefan-Boltzmann directly:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{P}{A} = \sigma T^4 = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(5760)^4 = 6.17 \times 10^7 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**(c)** Solar constant at Earth's distance:

Power spreads over a sphere of radius $$R_E$$:
<div class="equation">
$$A_E = 4\pi R_E^2 = 4\pi(1.50 \times 10^{11})^2 = 2.83 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

Solar constant:
<div class="equation">
$$S = \frac{P}{A_E} = \frac{3.80 \times 10^{26}}{2.83 \times 10^{23}} = 1.34 \times 10^3 \text{ W/m}^2 = 1340 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

**(a)** The calculated surface temperature of 5760 K (about 5487ºC) is remarkably accurate! The accepted value is approximately 5778 K, so our calculation is within 0.3%. This validates both the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the black body approximation for the Sun.

**(b)** The Sun's surface radiates an incredible 61.7 million watts per square meter! This enormous power output is sustained by nuclear fusion in the Sun's core, where hydrogen fuses into helium at temperatures of about 15 million K.

**(c)** The solar constant of approximately 1340 W/m² (often rounded to 1370 W/m² in current measurements) is fundamental to understanding Earth's climate and energy balance. This means:
- Each square meter facing the Sun at Earth's distance receives about 1.34 kW
- This drives photosynthesis, weather patterns, and ocean currents
- Solar panels on Earth receive this maximum power (minus atmospheric absorption)
- The actual value varies slightly (~±3%) due to Earth's elliptical orbit

The factor by which power decreases from Sun's surface to Earth is:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{6.17 \times 10^7}{1.34 \times 10^3} = 4.6 \times 10^4$$
</div>

This illustrates the inverse square law: $$\left(\frac{R_E}{R_s}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1.50 \times 10^{11}}{7.00 \times 10^8}\right)^2 = (214)^2 \approx 4.6 \times 10^4$$.

**Answer**

(a) The Sun's surface temperature is approximately **5760 K** (or **5487ºC**).
(b) The Sun radiates **6.17 × 10⁷ W/m²** from its surface.

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for net radiation: $$\frac{Q}{t \cdot A} = \sigma e(T_{sky}^4 - T_{body}^4)$$. We solve for $$T_{sky}$$ given the rate of energy transfer per unit area. Assuming emissivity $$e = 1$$ for simplicity.

**Solution**

Given:
- Rate of energy transfer per unit area: $$\frac{Q}{t \cdot A} = 1000 \text{ W/m}^2$$
- Body temperature: $$T_{body} = 27.0\text{ºC} = 300.15 \text{ K}$$

**Discussion**

The effective temperature of the sky would need to be approximately 2267 K (about 2000ºC) to deliver 1000 W/m² to a body at 27ºC. This is an interesting concept:

- The Sun's actual surface temperature is about 5778 K
- But the Sun occupies only a tiny fraction of the sky (~0.01% by solid angle)
- The rest of the sky is much cooler (near 3 K for deep space, somewhat warmer for atmosphere)
- The "effective temperature" of 2267 K represents a weighted average

This effective temperature concept is useful for:
1. **Solar engineering**: Designing solar collectors and thermal systems
2. **Climate modeling**: Understanding Earth's radiative balance
3. **Satellite thermal design**: Predicting heating/cooling in orbit

The actual solar irradiance reaching Earth's surface is typically:
- About 1000 W/m² on a clear day with the Sun directly overhead
- This matches the problem setup
- Lower at other times due to atmosphere, angle, clouds, etc.

For comparison, if the entire sky were uniformly at 2267 K, it would appear as a dull red glow (like molten steel), rather than the intense white-yellow point source we actually see as the Sun.

**Answer**

The effective temperature of the sky would be **2267 K** or approximately **2000ºC** (or **1994ºC** more precisely).

For dry air:
- Specific heat: $$c_{air} = 1005 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (at constant pressure)
- Density at 20ºC: $$\rho_{air} = 1.20 \text{ kg/m}^3$$
- Mass of air in 1 m³: $$m_{air} = 1.20 \text{ kg}$$

Temperature increase:

$$Q = m_{air}c_{air}\Delta T$$

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{Q}{m_{air}c_{air}} = \frac{12,408}{(1.20)(1005)} = \frac{12,408}{1206} = 10.3\text{ºC}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This problem beautifully illustrates several atmospheric phenomena:

**(a)** About 5.5 grams of water condense from each cubic meter when humid air cools from 30ºC to 20ºC. This represents:
- Dew formation on grass, cars, and surfaces overnight
- Fog formation when air cools below the dew point
- Condensation on cold surfaces (windows, cold drink glasses)

The physics: Warmer air can hold more water vapor. At 30ºC with 75% humidity, air contains 22.8 g/m³ of water vapor. When cooled to 20ºC, it can only hold 17.3 g/m³ at saturation (100% humidity). The excess (5.5 g/m³) must condense.

**(b)** The 12.4 kJ of heat released per cubic meter is substantial! This heat release:
- Warms the surrounding air, slowing further cooling
- Is a key mechanism in thunderstorm development (latent heat release in rising air)
- Explains why coastal areas have milder temperature swings (ocean moisture moderates cooling)
- Powers hurricanes (enormous latent heat release from ocean evaporation and subsequent condensation)

**(c)** If this heat went entirely into warming dry air, it would increase temperature by 10.3ºC! In reality:
- The air is not dry (it contains water vapor with higher heat capacity)
- Heat disperses to surroundings by convection and radiation
- Temperature rise is much less, but still measurable

Real-world implications:
1. **Dew point prediction**: When temperature approaches dew point, expect condensation (fog, dew, frost)
2. **Weather patterns**: Large-scale condensation releases enormous energy, driving storms
3. **Climate**: Water vapor is Earth's most important greenhouse gas and heat transport mechanism
4. **Comfort**: High humidity feels uncomfortable because sweat doesn't evaporate efficiently

For a typical bedroom (4m × 4m × 2.5m = 40 m³):
- Water condensed: 40 × 5.5 = 220 g (nearly a cup!)
- Heat released: 40 × 12.4 = 496 kJ
- This explains why humid rooms feel stuffy and why dehumidifiers extract surprising amounts of water

This problem demonstrates why:
- Humid summer nights don't cool as efficiently (latent heat release)
- Deserts have large day-night temperature swings (no moisture to moderate)
- Tropical regions have stable temperatures (high moisture content)
- Weather forecasters track dew point as critical for predicting fog and precipitation

**Answer**

(a) Approximately **5.5 grams** of water condense from each cubic meter.
(b) About **12.4 kJ** of heat is released by this condensation.
(c) This could cause a temperature increase of approximately **10.3ºC** in dry air.

Frozen waste from airplane toilets has sometimes been accidentally ejected at
high altitude. Ordinarily it breaks up and disperses over a large area, but
sometimes it holds together and strikes the ground. Calculate the mass of $$0 \text{ºC} $$ ice that can be melted by the conversion of kinetic and
gravitational potential energy when a $$20.0\text{ kg} $$ piece of frozen waste
is released at 12.0 km altitude while moving at 250 m/s and strikes the ground
at 100 m/s (since less than 20.0 kg melts, a significant mess results).

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy available for melting comes from: (1) loss of kinetic energy and (2) loss of gravitational potential energy. We calculate total energy lost and divide by the latent heat of fusion to find the mass that can be melted.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$m = 20.0 \text{ kg}$$
- Initial height: $$h_i = 12.0 \text{ km} = 12000 \text{ m}$$
- Final height: $$h_f = 0 \text{ m}$$
- Initial velocity: $$v_i = 250 \text{ m/s}$$
- Final velocity: $$v_f = 100 \text{ m/s}$$
- Latent heat of fusion for ice: $$L_f = 334 \times 10^3 \text{ J/kg}$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$

**Energy calculations:**

Loss of kinetic energy:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}m(v_i^2 - v_f^2) = \frac{1}{2}(20.0)[(250)^2 - (100)^2]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta KE = 10.0[62500 - 10000] = 10.0(52500) = 525000 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Loss of gravitational potential energy:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta PE = mgh = (20.0)(9.80)(12000) = 2.352 \times 10^6 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Total energy available:
<div class="equation">
$$E_{total} = \Delta KE + \Delta PE = 525000 + 2352000 = 2.877 \times 10^6 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Mass of ice that can be melted:
<div class="equation">
$$m_{melted} = \frac{E_{total}}{L_f} = \frac{2.877 \times 10^6}{334 \times 10^3} = 8.61 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

About 8.61 kg of the 20.0 kg frozen waste can be melted, meaning about 43% melts. This demonstrates:

1. **Gravitational potential energy dominates**: GPE = 2.35 MJ vs KE loss = 0.53 MJ (ratio ~4.4:1)
2. **Air resistance is significant**: The object slows from 250 m/s to 100 m/s, losing 82% of its kinetic energy to air friction
3. **Partial melting**: Less than half the mass melts, so a solid (but messy) core remains

The problem notes parenthetically that "less than 20.0 kg melts, a significant mess results"—our calculation confirms this. The 11.4 kg of remaining ice, combined with 8.6 kg of liquid water created from melting, would indeed create a substantial impact.

This type of incident, while rare, has actually occurred and caused damage to property. It illustrates:
- The importance of proper aircraft waste system maintenance
- The danger of falling objects from high altitude
- The significant energy involved in high-altitude, high-velocity objects

If all the energy went into melting, we could melt: $$\frac{2.877 \times 10^6}{334 \times 10^3} = 8.61$$ kg, which matches our answer since the ice starts at 0ºC (no cooling or heating needed before melting).

**Answer**

Approximately **8.61 kg** of ice can be melted (about **43%** of the total mass).

body are balanced? (b) Is this consistent with your experience in getting warm
while exercising?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We first calculate the mechanical power output, then find total metabolic power using efficiency. The waste heat (80%) raises body temperature. We use $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ to find the time needed.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$m = 76.0 \text{ kg}$$
- Stairs per minute: 116
- Typical stair height: $$h = 0.20 \text{ m}$$ (assumption)
- Efficiency: $$\eta = 20.0\% = 0.200$$
- Temperature rise: $$\Delta T = 1.00\text{ºC}$$
- Specific heat of human body: $$c = 3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$

**(a)** Calculate time for 1.00ºC temperature rise:

Mechanical power output:
<div class="equation">
$$P_{mech} = \frac{mgh \times n}{t} = \frac{(76.0)(9.80)(0.20)(116)}{60}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{mech} = \frac{17317}{60} = 289 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Total metabolic power:
<div class="equation">
$$P_{total} = \frac{P_{mech}}{\eta} = \frac{289}{0.200} = 1445 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Waste heat (power going into raising temperature):
<div class="equation">
$$P_{waste} = P_{total} - P_{mech} = 1445 - 289 = 1156 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Or: $$P_{waste} = (1 - \eta)P_{total} = (0.80)(1445) = 1156 \text{ W}$$

Heat needed to raise temperature by 1.00ºC:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = mc\Delta T = (76.0)(3500)(1.00) = 266000 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Time required:
<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{Q}{P_{waste}} = \frac{266000}{1156} = 230 \text{ s} = 3.83 \text{ min}$$
</div>

**(b)** Yes, this is consistent with experience. When exercising vigorously:
- You typically start feeling warmer within 3-5 minutes
- Sweating usually begins around this time to dissipate the excess heat
- The calculation assumes "all other forms of heat transfer are balanced," but in reality, your body quickly activates cooling mechanisms (sweating, increased blood flow to skin) to prevent dangerous temperature rise
- A 1ºC rise (from ~37ºC to ~38ºC) is noticeable but not dangerous, explaining why exercise feels warm but tolerable

**Discussion**

The result of 3.83 minutes makes excellent physical sense. The calculation reveals important insights about exercise physiology:

1. **High metabolic rate**: 1445 W is substantial—about 17 times the basal metabolic rate (~80-100 W)
2. **Inefficiency is normal**: Only 20% efficiency means 80% becomes heat, which is typical for human muscle
3. **Need for cooling**: 1156 W of waste heat requires active cooling to prevent overheating
4. **Sweating is essential**: Without sweating and increased blood flow to skin, body temperature would rise dangerously within minutes

In practice, your body prevents the full 1ºC rise by:
- Increasing skin blood flow (vasodilation)
- Sweating (evaporative cooling can remove 500+ W)
- Increased respiration
- Radiative and convective heat loss

This problem illustrates why:
- Athletes can exercise for hours without overheating (if properly hydrated)
- Exercise in hot, humid conditions is dangerous (reduced cooling effectiveness)
- Acclimatization to heat involves improved sweating response
- Dehydration is dangerous during exercise (reduces sweating capacity)

**Answer**

(a) It would take approximately **230 seconds** or **3.83 minutes** for body temperature to rise by 1.00ºC.
(b) Yes, this is consistent with getting warm within a few minutes of starting vigorous exercise.

no heat transfers back into the 1.00 km³ of rock by its surroundings?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$Q = mc\Delta T$$, where the mass is calculated from the volume and density of granite. For part (b), we use $$t = Q/P$$ where $$P$$ is the power (rate of heat transfer).

**Solution**

Given:
- Volume: $$V = 1.00 \text{ km}^3 = 1.00 \times 10^9 \text{ m}^3$$
- Temperature change: $$\Delta T = 100\text{ºC}$$
- Density of granite: $$\rho = 2700 \text{ kg/m}^3$$ (typical value)
- Specific heat of granite: $$c = 840 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (same as concrete, from Ch 14 Table 1)
- Power output: $$P = 300 \text{ MW} = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ W}$$

**(a)** Heat transfer from cooling granite:

Mass of granite:
<div class="equation">
$$m = \rho V = (2700)(1.00 \times 10^9) = 2.70 \times 10^{12} \text{ kg}$$
</div>

Heat extracted:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = mc\Delta T = (2.70 \times 10^{12})(840)(100)$$

<div class="equation">

**(b)** Time to extract this heat at 300 MW:

<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{2.268 \times 10^{17}}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 7.56 \times 10^8 \text{ s}$$

Convert to years:
<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{7.56 \times 10^8 \text{ s}}{365.25 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ s/year}} = \frac{7.56 \times 10^8}{31,557,600} = 23.9 \text{ years}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

**(a)** The heat energy stored in 1 km³ of hot granite is enormous: $$2.27 \times 10^{17}$$ joules or 227 petajoules (PJ). For perspective:
- This equals about 63 billion kilowatt-hours of energy
- Enough to power a city of 1 million people for several years
- Equivalent to burning about 5 million tons of coal

**(b)** The geothermal resource would last approximately 24 years at 300 MW extraction rate. This demonstrates:

1. **Geothermal is substantial**: Large reserves of thermal energy exist in hot rock
2. **Long lifetime**: A single geothermal field can operate for decades
3. **Renewable character**: Heat conducts back from surrounding rock over time, partially replenishing the resource
4. **Clean energy**: No combustion, minimal emissions

Real geothermal plants typically:
- Extract heat more slowly to allow replenishment
- Operate for 20-30 years or longer
- Use multiple wells to access larger rock volumes
- Account for heat conduction from surrounding regions

Notable geothermal regions include:
- Iceland (powers ~90% of homes with geothermal)
- The Geysers, California (largest geothermal complex in the world)
- New Zealand's Taupo Volcanic Zone
- Italy's Larderello field

The calculation assumes perfect insulation (no heat return from surroundings), which is pessimistic. In reality, heat conducts from the surrounding hot rock, extending the operational lifetime significantly beyond 24 years.

(a) The heat transfer that can be extracted is **2.27 × 10¹⁷ J** or approximately **227 PJ**.

**Strategy**

For part (a), gravitational potential energy converts to thermal energy. We use $$mgh = mc\Delta T$$ and solve for $$\Delta T$$. For part (b), we calculate what fraction must evaporate so that the latent heat of vaporization equals the gravitational potential energy.

**Solution**

Given:
- Height: $$h = 55.0 \text{ m}$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$
- Specific heat of water: $$c = 4186 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Latent heat of vaporization: $$L_v = 2256 \times 10^3 \text{ J/kg}$$

**(a)** Temperature increase:

Gravitational potential energy per unit mass:
<div class="equation">
$$gh = (9.80)(55.0) = 539 \text{ J/kg}$$
</div>

This equals the heat absorbed per unit mass:
<div class="equation">
$$gh = c\Delta T$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{gh}{c} = \frac{539}{4186} = 0.129\text{ºC}$$

**(b)** Fraction that must evaporate:

Let $$f$$ = fraction that evaporates. Energy to evaporate fraction $$f$$:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{evap} = f \cdot m \cdot L_v$$
</div>

Energy from falling:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{fall} = mgh$$
</div>

Setting them equal:
<div class="equation">
$$f \cdot m \cdot L_v = mgh$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{gh}{L_v} = \frac{539}{2256 \times 10^3} = \frac{539}{2256000} = 2.39 \times 10^{-4}$$
</div>

As a percentage:
<div class="equation">
$$f = 0.0239\% \approx 0.024\%$$
</div>

**Discussion**

**(a)** The temperature increase of only 0.129ºC (about 0.13ºC) is surprisingly small for such a dramatic 55-meter drop. This demonstrates that:
- Water has a very high specific heat (4186 J/kg·ºC)
- Gravitational potential energy, while significant, produces only modest heating
- The temperature change would be barely perceptible

In reality, the temperature increase at the bottom of Niagara Falls is even less than calculated because:
- Much energy goes into turbulence, sound, and spray
- Evaporation occurs (cooling effect)
- Mixing with cooler water
- Air incorporation into the falling water

**(b)** Only about 0.024% (roughly 1/4000th) of the water needs to evaporate to completely prevent temperature rise. This tiny fraction demonstrates:
- The enormous energy required for phase changes (latent heat)
- Why evaporation is such an effective cooling mechanism
- How mist and spray at the base of waterfalls provide natural cooling

For Niagara Falls' flow rate of roughly 750,000 gallons per second (2.8 million liters/second or 2800 tonnes/second):
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Evaporation rate} = (2800 \text{ tonnes/s})(2.39 \times 10^{-4}) = 0.67 \text{ tonnes/s} = 670 \text{ kg/s}$$
</div>

This creates the characteristic mist and contributes to the spectacular visual effect!

The calculation also explains why:
- Hydroelectric dams don't significantly heat rivers
- Waterfalls are often surrounded by cool, moist microclimates
- The energy from falling water is substantial but distributed across the large thermal capacity of water

**Answer**

(a) The temperature increase is approximately **0.129ºC** or **0.13ºC**.

$$m_{ice} = \frac{Q_{waste}}{L_f} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^8}{334 \times 10^3} = 314 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**(b)** No, this is NOT reasonable! Carrying 314 kg (about 692 pounds) of ice to cool the engine for burning just 1 gallon of gasoline is completely impractical.

For perspective:
- A typical car's fuel tank holds 12-15 gallons
- This would require nearly 4000 kg (4 metric tons) of ice
- The ice would weigh more than the car itself!
- You'd need to refill ice more often than gasoline

**(c)** Unreasonable premises/assumptions:

1. **Ice is impractical to carry**: The enormous mass makes it infeasible
2. **Ice availability**: Finding ice in the Arctic might seem easy, but constantly harvesting, storing, and loading 314 kg per gallon is labor-intensive
3. **Melting doesn't cool efficiently**: Ice at 0ºC melting to water at 0ºC removes heat, but the resulting water at 0ºC then heats up rapidly, reducing cooling effectiveness
4. **Phase change only**: The calculation assumes ice only melts, not that the resulting water also heats up, which would require even more ice
5. **Continuous supply needed**: Unlike a radiator that recirculates coolant, ice is consumed and must be constantly replenished
6. **Storage problems**: 314 kg of ice takes significant space and would begin melting immediately

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates why conventional cooling systems exist. A water-cooled system:
- Recirculates the same coolant repeatedly
- Uses airflow through radiator to dissipate heat
- Weighs only ~10-20 kg (coolant + radiator + pump)
- Operates continuously without refilling (except for minor losses)

The "Arctic inventor" is indeed "slightly deranged"! The calculation shows that even with unlimited ice access, the logistics make it absurdly impractical. Modern cooling systems are far more elegant and efficient.

Historical note: Early engines did experiment with evaporative cooling (letting water boil away), but even that was abandoned in favor of recirculating systems.

**Answer**

(a) The waste heat could melt approximately **314 kg** of ice.
(b) **No**, this is completely unreasonable—314 kg per gallon is far too much to carry practically.
(c) The premise that ice-cooling is simpler or practical is unreasonable due to the enormous mass required and the one-time use nature of the ice.

**Unreasonable Results**

A meteorite 1.20 cm in diameter is so hot immediately after penetrating the
atmosphere that it radiates 20.0 kW of power. (a) What is its temperature, if
the surroundings are at $$20.0 \text{ºC} $$ and it has an emissivity of 0.800? (
b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which premise or assumption is
responsible?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law $$P = \sigma eA(T^4 - T_{surr}^4)$$ to solve for the meteorite's temperature. We then evaluate whether this temperature is physically reasonable.

**Solution**

Given:
- Diameter: $$d = 1.20 \text{ cm} = 0.0120 \text{ m}$$
- Radius: $$r = 0.00600 \text{ m}$$
- Power radiated: $$P = 20.0 \text{ kW} = 20000 \text{ W}$$
- Surroundings temperature: $$T_{surr} = 20.0\text{ºC} = 293.15 \text{ K}$$
- Emissivity: $$e = 0.800$$
- Stefan-Boltzmann constant: $$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2\cdot\text{K}^4$$

**(a)** Calculate the meteorite's temperature:

Surface area (sphere):
<div class="equation">
$$A = 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi(0.00600)^2 = 4.52 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

Using Stefan-Boltzmann law:
<div class="equation">
$$P = \sigma eA(T^4 - T_{surr}^4)$$
</div>

Since $$T \gg T_{surr}$$, we can approximate $$T^4 - T_{surr}^4 \approx T^4$$:
<div class="equation">
$$20000 = (5.67 \times 10^{-8})(0.800)(4.52 \times 10^{-4})T^4$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$20000 = 2.05 \times 10^{-11} T^4$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$T^4 = \frac{20000}{2.05 \times 10^{-11}} = 9.76 \times 10^{14} \text{ K}^4$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$T = (9.76 \times 10^{14})^{1/4} = 31400 \text{ K}$$
</div>

Converting to Celsius:
<div class="equation">
$$T = 31400 - 273 = 31127\text{ºC} \approx 31000\text{ºC}$$
</div>

**(b)** This result is UNREASONABLE because:
- 31,400 K (31,000ºC) is approximately **5.4 times the Sun's surface temperature** (5778 K)
- This is hotter than many stellar surfaces!
- No meteorite could maintain such a temperature
- At this temperature, the meteorite would vaporize instantly
- Materials begin to vaporize at much lower temperatures (most metals vaporize below 3000ºC)

**(c)** The unreasonable assumption is the **power output of 20.0 kW from such a small meteorite**.

For perspective:
- The meteorite has diameter 1.20 cm (about the size of a large marble)
- 20 kW from this tiny object means enormous energy density
- This would require impossibly high temperature or impossibly high emissivity beyond physical limits

More reasonable scenarios:
- A 1.2-cm meteorite entering atmosphere heats to ~1500-2000°C
- At this temperature, it would radiate only ~10-50 W, not 20,000 W
- Most meteorites ablate (vaporize) during entry, never reaching such extreme temperatures at ground level

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates the importance of checking whether calculated results make physical sense. The telltale signs that something is wrong:

1. **Temperature exceeds known limits**: Nothing solid exists above ~4000°C (tungsten's melting point)
2. **Exceeds stellar temperatures**: Hotter than most stars is a red flag for Earth-based objects
3. **Power density is absurd**: 20 kW from a marble-sized object implies extraordinary energy flux

In reality, small meteorites:
- Heat to 1000-2000°C during atmospheric entry
- Ablate (surface vaporizes), which limits temperature rise
- Often cool significantly before impact
- Typically radiate 10s to 100s of watts, not kilowatts

The problem is intentionally designed to produce an unreasonable answer, teaching students to critically evaluate results rather than blindly accepting calculations.

**Answer**

(a) The calculated temperature is approximately **31,400 K** or **31,000ºC**.
(b) This is unreasonable because it's about **5.4 times hotter than the Sun's surface**—no meteorite could exist at this temperature.
(c) The unreasonable premise is the **20.0 kW power output** from such a small meteorite, which is far too high for its size and realistic temperature.

Consider a new model of commercial airplane having its brakes tested as a part

speed and then stopped with the brakes alone. Construct a problem in which you
calculate the temperature increase of the brakes during this process. You may
assume most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to thermal energy
in the brakes and surrounding materials, and that little escapes. Note that the
brakes are expected to become so hot in this procedure that they ignite and, in
order to pass the test, the airplane must be able to withstand the fire for some
