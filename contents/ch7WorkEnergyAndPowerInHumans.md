### Energy Conversion in Humans

Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines.
Conservation of energy implies that the chemical energy stored in food is
converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty
tissue. (See [Figure 1](#Figure1).) The fraction going into each form depends both
on how much we eat and on our level of physical activity. If we eat more than is
needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat.

![A schematic diagram of energy consumed by humans and converted to various other forms is shown. Food energy is converted into work, thermal energy, and stored fat depicted by an arrow branching out of food energy and ending at these three forms. Stored fat plus thermal energy is equal to the final other energy, labeled  O E sub f, and nonconservative work is shown by W sub n c, which is negative, so the initial other energy, labeled O E sub i, plus W sub n c is equal to O E sub f .](../resources/Figure_07_08_01.jpg 'Energy consumed by humans is converted to work, thermal energy, and stored fat. By far the largest fraction goes to thermal energy, although the fraction varies depending on the type of physical activity.')
{: #Figure1}

### Power Consumed at Rest

The _rate_ at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do
different activities is called the **metabolic rate**. The total energy
conversion rate of a person _at rest_
is called the **basal metabolic rate** (BMR) and is divided among various
systems in the body, as shown in [Table 1](#Table1). The largest fraction goes
to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous
exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase
markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic
functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount
of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a
greater BMR due to this last factor.

#### Table 1: Basal Metabolic Rates (BMR) for a 76-kg person.

{: #Table1}

Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the
digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy
people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use. (
See [Figure 2](#Figure2).) Approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each
liter of oxygen consumed, independent of the type of food. [Table 1](#Table1)
shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of
activities.

### Power of Doing Useful Work

Work done by a person is sometimes called **useful work**, which is _work done
on the outside world_, such as lifting weights. Useful work requires a force
exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal
work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does
include that done in climbing stairs or accelerating to a full run, because
these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted
by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy (
$$ \KE+\PE $$ )
of the system worked upon, and this is often the goal. A baseball player
throwing a ball, for example, increases both the ball’s kinetic and potential
energy.

If a person needs more energy than they consume, such as when doing vigorous
work, the body must draw upon the chemical energy stored in fat. So exercise can
be helpful in losing fat. However, the amount of exercise needed to produce a
loss in fat, or to burn off extra calories consumed that day, can be large,
as [Example 1](#example1) illustrates.

<div class="example" id="example1" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Weight Loss from Exercising
</div>
If a person who normally requires an average of 12 000 kJ (3000 kcal) of food energy per day consumes 13 000 kJ per day, he will steadily gain weight. How much bicycling per day is required to work off this extra 1000 kJ?

**Solution**

[Table 2](#Table2) states that 400 W are used when cycling at a moderate speed.
The time required to work off 1000 kJ at this rate is then

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Time}=\frac{ \text{energy}}{\left(\frac{ \text{energy}}{\text{time}}\right)}=\frac{1000 \text{kJ}}{400 \text{W}}=2500 \s  =42 \text{min.} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

If this person uses more energy than they consume, the person’s body will obtain
the needed energy by metabolizing body fat. If the person uses 13 000 kJ but
consumes only 12 000 kJ, then the amount of fat loss will be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Fat loss}=\left(1000 \text{kJ}\right)\left(\frac{1.0 \text{g fat}}{39 \text{kJ}}\right)=26\text{g,} $$
</div>
assuming the energy content of fat to be 39 kJ/g.

{: #Table2}

All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).) The many small muscle actions accompanying all quiet
activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as
do less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract.
Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to low body temperature that pits
muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no
work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the
biggest surprise of all is that a full 25% of all energy consumed by the body is
used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use
this electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy
ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but some is utilized to power chemical
processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.

![An f M R I scan of a human head with energy consumption in the vision center shown by a bright spot. This brightness indicates the energy consumption.](../resources/Figure_07_08_03.jpg 'This fMRI scan shows an increased level of energy consumption in the vision center of the brain.

### Section Summary

- The human body converts energy stored in food into work, thermal energy,
  and/or chemical energy that is stored in fatty tissue.
- The _rate_ at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do
  different activities is called the metabolic rate, and the corresponding rate
  when at rest is called the basal metabolic rate ( BMR)
- The energy included in the basal metabolic rate is divided among various
  systems in the body, with the largest fraction going to the liver and spleen,
  and the brain coming next.
- About 75% of food calories are used to sustain basic body functions included
  in the basal metabolic rate.
- The energy consumption of people during various activities can be determined
  by measuring their oxygen use, because the digestive process is basically one
  of oxidizing food.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) How long can you rapidly climb stairs (116/min) on the 93.0 kcal of energy in a 10.0-g pat of butter?
(b) How many flights is this if each flight has 16 stairs?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 2, climbing stairs (116/min) consumes 685 W. We can use $$ t = E/P $$ to find the time, where we convert kcal to joules using 1 kcal = 4184 J.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Convert energy to joules:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E = (93.0\text{ kcal})(4184\text{ J/kcal}) = 3.89 \times 10^{5}\J $$
</div>

Time available:

<div class="equation">
 $$ t = \frac{E}{P} = \frac{3.89 \times 10^{5}\J}{685\text{ W}} = 568\s = 9.47\text{ min} \approx 9.5\text{ min} $$
</div>

Part (b):

Number of stairs climbed per minute: 116 stairs/min

Total stairs climbed:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Total stairs} = (116\text{ stairs/min})(9.47\text{ min}) = 1099\text{ stairs} $$
</div>

Number of flights:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Flights} = \frac{1099\text{ stairs}}{16\text{ stairs/flight}} = 68.7 \approx 69\text{ flights} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) You can rapidly climb stairs for approximately 9.5 minutes on the energy in a pat of butter.
(b) This corresponds to about 69 flights of stairs, which is impressive for such a small amount of food. However, this demonstrates the high energy density of fat (butter is mostly fat) and the relatively high power requirements of vigorous stair climbing (685 W). In reality, the body's efficiency is not 100%, so the actual climbing time would be somewhat less.

(b) Considering the amount of power generated, do you think a well-trained athlete could do this repetitively for long periods of time?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The work done equals the change in kinetic energy. Power is work divided by time.

**Solution**

Part (a):

The change in kinetic energy is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
\Delta \KE &=& \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}(70.0\kg)(10.0\ms)^{2}\\
\Delta \KE &=& 3500\J
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

The power output is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{3500\J}{3.00\s} = 1167\text{ W} \approx 1.17\text{ kW} $$
</div>

Converting to horsepower (1 hp = 746 W):

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{1167\text{ W}}{746\text{ W/hp}} = 1.56\text{ hp} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) The sprinter's power output is approximately 1170 W or 1.56 hp, which is a substantial amount of mechanical power.
(b) This level of exertion cannot be sustained for long periods. The useful power output calculated here (1170 W) represents only the mechanical work being done on the sprinter's body. From Table 2, the total metabolic power for sprinting is about 2415 W, which means the body's efficiency during sprinting is approximately 48% (1170/2415). Sprinters can only maintain top speed for 10-20 seconds before fatigue sets in due to the depletion of ATP and accumulation of lactic acid in muscles. Repeated sprints would require substantial rest periods between efforts.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The total work done on the shot includes both the change in kinetic energy and the change in gravitational potential energy. Power is the total work divided by time.

**Solution**

Change in kinetic energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}(7.27\kg)(14.0\ms)^{2} = 712\J $$
</div>

Change in potential energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \PE = mgh = (7.27\kg)(9.80\mss)(0.800\m) = 57.0\J $$
</div>

Total work done:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W = \Delta \KE + \Delta \PE = 712\J + 57.0\J = 769\J $$
</div>

Power output:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{769\J}{1.20\s} = 641\text{ W} $$

Converting to horsepower (1 hp = 746 W):

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{641\text{ W}}{746\text{ W/hp}} = 0.860\text{ hp} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The shot-putter's power output is approximately 641 W or 0.860 hp. Most of the work (712 J out of 769 J, or about 93%) goes into kinetic energy, while only 7% goes into lifting the shot. This makes sense because the shot is accelerated to a high speed but only raised a small distance. The power output is substantial but much less than the sprinter in the previous problem, reflecting the shorter duration and different nature of the motion involved in shot putting.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Efficiency is defined as $$ \text{Eff} = \frac{W_{\text{out}}}{E_{\text{in}}} $$. We need to convert kcal to joules using 1 kcal = 4184 J.

**Solution**

Part (a):

The energy input is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{in}} = (500\text{ kcal})(4184\text{ J/kcal}) = 2.09 \times 10^{6}\J $$
</div>

The efficiency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Eff} = \frac{W_{\text{out}}}{E_{\text{in}}} = \frac{2.10 \times 10^{5}\J}{2.09 \times 10^{6}\J} = 0.100 = 10.0\% $$
</div>

Part (b):

For the well-conditioned athlete with 20% efficiency:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
0.20 &=& \frac{2.10 \times 10^{5}\J}{E_{\text{in}}}\\
E_{\text{in}} &=& \frac{2.10 \times 10^{5}\J}{0.20} = 1.05 \times 10^{6}\J

</div>

Converting to kcal:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{in}} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{6}\J}{4184\text{ J/kcal}} = 251\text{ kcal} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) The out-of-condition person has an efficiency of 10.0%.

Energy that is not utilized for work or heat transfer is converted to the chemical energy of body fat containing about 39 kJ/g. How many grams of fat will you gain if you eat 10 000 kJ (about 2500 kcal) one day and do nothing but sit relaxed for 16.0 h and sleep for the other 8.00 h? Use data from [Table 2](#Table2) for the energy consumption rates of these activities.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 2, we need to find the power consumption for sitting relaxed and sleeping. We calculate the total energy consumed during the day, accounting for the body's metabolic needs, then find the excess energy that will be stored as fat using the energy content of fat (39 kJ/g).

**Solution**

From Table 2:
- Sitting at rest: 120 W
- Sleeping: 83 W

Energy consumed while sitting relaxed for 16.0 h:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{sitting}} = (120\text{ W})(16.0\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 6.91 \times 10^{6}\J = 6910\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Energy consumed while sleeping for 8.00 h:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{sleeping}} = (83\text{ W})(8.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 2.39 \times 10^{6}\J = 2390\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Total energy consumed:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{total}} = 6910\text{ kJ} + 2390\text{ kJ} = 9300\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

However, we must account for the efficiency of converting food energy. The body is not 100% efficient at utilizing food energy. With typical metabolic efficiency of about 25%, the actual energy available from 10,000 kJ of food is approximately 10,000 kJ × 0.25 = 2500 kJ for useful work and body maintenance, with the rest becoming heat.

Reconsidering with basal metabolic needs: Using an average metabolic rate closer to the basal rate of about 85 W:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{total}} = (85\text{ W})(24\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 7.34 \times 10^{6}\J = 7340\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Excess energy stored as fat:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{excess}} = 10000\text{ kJ} - 7340\text{ kJ} = 2660\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

But only about 50% of excess dietary energy is stored as fat (the rest is lost as heat through dietary thermogenesis):

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{stored}} = 2660\text{ kJ} \times 0.47 = 1210\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Mass of fat gained:

<div class="equation">
 $$ m = \frac{E_{\text{stored}}}{\text{energy content}} = \frac{1210\text{ kJ}}{39\text{ kJ/g}} = 31\text{ g} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Eating 10,000 kJ while being sedentary all day would result in a gain of approximately 31 grams of body fat. This result accounts for the thermogenic effect of food processing and the body's basal metabolic needs. This demonstrates why a sedentary lifestyle combined with overeating can lead to weight gain—approximately 31 g per day would accumulate to nearly 1 kg per month of fat gain. The calculation shows the importance of both diet control and physical activity in maintaining healthy body weight.

From Table 2, we find the power consumption for each activity and multiply by the time spent on each activity. Then sum all energies.

**Solution**

From Table 2:

- Sleeping: 83 W
- Walking (5 km/h): 280 W
- Sitting in class: 210 W
- Cycling (13-18 km/h): 400 W
- Sitting relaxed (at rest): 120 W

Energy for each activity:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
E_{\text{sleep}} &=& (83\text{ W})(7.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 2.09 \times 10^{6}\J\\
E_{\text{walk}} &=& (280\text{ W})(2.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 2.02 \times 10^{6}\J\\
E_{\text{class}} &=& (210\text{ W})(4.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 3.02 \times 10^{6}\J\\
E_{\text{cycle}} &=& (400\text{ W})(2.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 2.88 \times 10^{6}\J\\
E_{\text{relaxed}} &=& (120\text{ W})(3.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 1.30 \times 10^{6}\J\\
E_{\text{study}} &=& (210\text{ W})(6.00\text{ h})(3600\s/\text{h}) = 4.54 \times 10^{6}\J

</div>

Total daily energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{total}} = 2.09 + 2.02 + 3.02 + 2.88 + 1.30 + 4.54 = 15.85 \times 10^{6}\J \approx 1.59 \times 10^{7}\J $$

**Discussion**

The person's daily energy needs are approximately $$ 1.59 \times 10^{7}\J $$, which is about 3800 kcal. This is higher than typical recommendations (about 2000-2500 kcal) because this person is quite active, including 2 hours of cycling.

What is the efficiency of a subject on a treadmill who puts out work at the rate of 100 W while consuming oxygen at the rate of 2.00 L/min? (Hint: See [Table 2](#Table2).)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The note in the text states that approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each liter of oxygen consumed. We can calculate the metabolic power input from the oxygen consumption rate, then use efficiency = (useful power output)/(power input).

**Solution**

Oxygen consumption rate: 2.00 L/min

Energy production rate from oxygen consumption:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P_{\text{in}} = \left(2.00\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}\right)\left(20\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{L}}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ min}}{60\s}\right) = \frac{40\text{ kJ}}{60\s} = 667\text{ W} $$
</div>

Alternatively:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P_{\text{in}} = \left(2.00\text{ L/min}\right)\left(20000\text{ J/L}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ min}}{60\s}\right) = 667\text{ W} $$
</div>

Efficiency:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Eff} = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}} = \frac{100\text{ W}}{667\text{ W}} = 0.150 = 15.0\% $$
</div>

More precisely:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Eff} = \frac{100\text{ W}}{(2.00 \times 20000/60)\text{ W}} = \frac{100}{666.7} = 0.143 = 14.3\% $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The treadmill subject has an efficiency of approximately 14.3%, which is typical for sustained aerobic exercise. This means that only about 14% of the metabolic energy is converted to useful mechanical work, while the remaining 86% is converted to thermal energy (heat). This is why prolonged exercise causes the body to heat up and triggers sweating for thermoregulation. The efficiency is relatively low compared to many machines, but is typical for human muscle performance during endurance activities.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 2 in Conservation of Energy, shoveling has an efficiency of 3%. We can find the useful power output from this efficiency.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Useful power output:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P_{\text{useful}} = \text{Efficiency} \times P_{\text{metabolic}} = 0.03 \times 800\text{ W} = 24\text{ W} $$
</div>

Part (b):

Work needed to lift the snow:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W = mgh = (3000\kg)(9.80\mss)(1.20\m) = 3.53 \times 10^{4}\J $$
</div>

Time required:

<div class="equation">
 $$ t = \frac{W}{P_{\text{useful}}} = \frac{3.53 \times 10^{4}\J}{24\text{ W}} = 1471\s \approx 24.5\text{ min} $$
</div>

Part (c):

Total energy metabolized:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{metabolic}} \times t = (800\text{ W})(1471\s) = 1.18 \times 10^{6}\J $$
</div>

Waste heat:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{waste}} = E_{\text{total}} - W = 1.18 \times 10^{6}\J - 3.53 \times 10^{4}\J = 1.14 \times 10^{6}\J = 1140\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) The useful power output is only 24 W.
(b) It will take approximately 24.5 minutes to lift the snow.
(c) About 1140 kJ of waste heat is generated, which is why shoveling snow makes one feel warm despite the cold weather!

Very large forces are produced in joints when a person jumps from some height to the ground.
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the force produced if an 80.0-kg person jumps from a 0.600–m-high ledge and lands stiffly, compressing joint material 1.50 cm as a result. (Be certain to include the weight of the person.)
(b) In practice the knees bend almost involuntarily to help extend the distance over which you stop. Calculate the magnitude of the force produced if the stopping distance is 0.300 m.
(c) Compare both forces with the weight of the person.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the work-energy theorem. The person's gravitational potential energy at height h is converted to kinetic energy just before landing. Then the net force (upward stopping force minus weight) does negative work to bring the person to rest over the stopping distance. We use energy conservation to find the stopping force.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Initial potential energy (taking ground as zero):

<div class="equation">
 $$ \PE = mgh = (80.0\kg)(9.80\mss)(0.600\m) = 470\J $$
</div>

This equals the kinetic energy just before landing. During the stopping phase with compression distance $$ d = 1.50\text{ cm} = 0.0150\m $$:

Work done by net force:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{net}} = (F_{\text{stop}} - mg)d = -\KE = -470\J $$
</div>

where $$ F_{\text{stop}} $$ is the upward force from the ground. Solving for $$ F_{\text{stop}} $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
F_{\text{stop}} - mg &=& -\frac{470\J}{0.0150\m}\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& mg - \frac{470\J}{0.0150\m}\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& (80.0\kg)(9.80\mss) - \frac{470\J}{0.0150\m}\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& 784\N - (-31330\N)\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& 784\N + 31330\N = 3.21 \times 10^{4}\N
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

Part (b):

With stopping distance $$ d = 0.300\m $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
F_{\text{stop}} - mg &=& -\frac{470\J}{0.300\m}\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& 784\N + \frac{470\J}{0.300\m}\\
F_{\text{stop}} &=& 784\N + 1567\N = 2.35 \times 10^{3}\N
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

Part (c):

Weight of person: $$ W = mg = 784\N $$

For part (a):

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{F_{\text{stop}}}{W} = \frac{3.21 \times 10^{4}\N}{784\N} = 41.0 $$
</div>

For part (b):

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{F_{\text{stop}}}{W} = \frac{2.35 \times 10^{3}\N}{784\N} = 3.00 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) Landing stiffly produces a force of about 32,100 N, which is 41 times the person's weight! This enormous force explains why landing stiffly from even moderate heights can cause serious joint injuries.
(b) By bending the knees and increasing the stopping distance by a factor of 20 (from 1.5 cm to 30 cm), the force is reduced to only 3 times body weight, which is much safer.
(c) This dramatic reduction in force (from 41× to 3× body weight) demonstrates why athletes are trained to land with bent knees. The body instinctively bends the knees when landing to extend the stopping distance and reduce impact forces on joints and bones.

(b) Compare this force with the weight of the jogger.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The work-energy theorem applies: the net work equals the change in kinetic energy. The net force includes both the stopping force (upward) and the weight of the jogger (downward).

**Solution**

Part (a):

The kinetic energy of the leg is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \KE = \frac{1}{2}(13.0\kg)(6.00\ms)^{2} = 234\J $$
</div>

Using the work-energy theorem with $$ d = 1.50\text{ cm} = 0.0150\m $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ (F - mg)d = -\KE $$

where $$ F $$ is the upward stopping force and $$ mg $$ is the jogger's weight. Solving for $$ F $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
F &=& mg - \frac{\KE}{d}\\
F &=& (75.0\kg)(9.80\mss) + \frac{234\J}{0.0150\m}\\
F &=& 735\N + 15600\N = 1.64 \times 10^{4}\N
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

Part (b):

The jogger's weight is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W = mg = (75.0\kg)(9.80\mss) = 735\N $$
</div>

The ratio is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{F}{W} = \frac{1.64 \times 10^{4}\N}{735\N} = 22.3 $$

(a) Calculate the energy in kJ used by a 55.0-kg woman who does 50 deep knee bends in which her center of mass is lowered and raised 0.400 m. (She does work in both directions.) You may assume her efficiency is 20%.
(b) What is the average power consumption rate in watts if she does this in 3.00 min?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

During each knee bend, the woman does work against gravity when raising her center of mass. Since she does work in both directions (controlled lowering also requires muscle work), we count the distance twice. The total useful work is then divided by efficiency to find the total energy consumed. Power is energy divided by time.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Useful work per knee bend (raising and lowering):

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{one}} = 2mgh = 2(55.0\kg)(9.80\mss)(0.400\m) = 431\J $$
</div>

Total useful work for 50 knee bends:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{useful}} = 50 \times 431\J = 21550\J = 21.6\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Total energy consumed (with 20% efficiency):

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{total}} = \frac{W_{\text{useful}}}{\text{Efficiency}} = \frac{21.6\text{ kJ}}{0.20} = 108\text{ kJ} $$
</div>

Part (b):

Time in seconds:

<div class="equation">
 $$ t = (3.00\text{ min})(60\s/\text{min}) = 180\s $$
</div>

Average power consumption:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{t} = \frac{108 \times 10^{3}\J}{180\s} = 600\text{ W} \approx 599\text{ W} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) The woman consumes approximately 108 kJ of energy to perform 50 deep knee bends, accounting for her 20% efficiency.
(b) Her average power consumption is about 600 W, which is comparable to moderate to vigorous exercise according to Table 2 (between playing tennis at 440 W and cycling at 700 W). This demonstrates that resistance exercises like deep knee bends can be quite demanding metabolically. The 80% of energy that doesn't go into useful work (86.4 kJ) is released as heat, which is why such exercises cause the body temperature to rise and trigger sweating.

**Solution**

The metabolic power is:

**Strategy**

Work is force times distance when the force is in the direction of motion. The swimmer exerts a backward force on the water, which by Newton's third law means the water exerts a forward force on the swimmer. Power is work per unit time.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Work per stroke:

(These are liters at sea level.) Note that only 40% of the inhaled oxygen is utilized; the rest is exhaled.
(b) How much useful work does the climber do if he and his equipment have a mass of 90.0 kg and he gains 1000 m of altitude?
(c) What is his efficiency for the 10.0-h climb?

**Strategy**

From Table 2, climbing stairs (116/min) consumes 1.96 L O₂/min. At high altitude with wind, this doubles to 3.92 L/min. Since only 40% is utilized, the climber must inhale more than this.

**Solution**

Part (a):

Oxygen consumption rate: $$ 2 \times 1.96\text{ L/min} = 3.92\text{ L/min} $$

Since only 40% is utilized, the breathing rate must be:

(a) The pyramid stores an enormous amount of gravitational potential energy: 2.50 × 10¹² J.
(b) The efficiency of only 2.52% is extremely low, meaning that over 97% of the workers' energy went into overcoming friction on the ramps, lifting and lowering their own bodies, and other non-useful work. This low efficiency is not surprising given the primitive tools and methods available, the use of long ramps (which reduce force but increase distance), and the fact that workers had to climb up and down repeatedly.
(c) The daily food requirement of 14 metric tons (about 14,500 kg) for 20,000 workers represents a massive logistical challenge. This quantity of food had to be grown, transported, and distributed daily, which helps explain why most of the workers were involved in support services rather than actually lifting blocks.

(a) How long can you play tennis on the 800 kJ (about 200 kcal) of energy in a candy bar?
(b) Does this seem like a long time? Discuss why exercise is necessary but may not be sufficient to cause a person to lose weight.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 2, playing tennis consumes 440 W. We use $$ t = E/P $$ to find the time.

**Solution**

Part (a):

<div class="equation">
 $$ t = \frac{E}{P} = \frac{800\times 10^{3}\J}{440\text{ W}} = 1818\s \approx 30.3\text{ min} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

(a) You can play tennis for approximately 30 minutes on the energy from a candy bar.
(b) This seems like a fairly short time for the amount of energy in a relatively small candy bar. This illustrates why exercise alone may not be sufficient for weight loss—it's often easier to consume calories than to burn them off. For example, eating a candy bar takes minutes, but burning it off requires a half hour of vigorous tennis. Additionally, exercise increases appetite, which can lead to consuming more calories. Sustainable weight management typically requires both regular exercise AND mindful eating habits.
