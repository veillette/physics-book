* Discuss the single slit diffraction pattern.
</div>

Light passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat
different from those formed by double slits or diffraction
gratings. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows a single slit diffraction pattern. Note
that the central maximum is larger than those on either side, and that the
intensity decreases rapidly on either side. In contrast, a diffraction grating
produces evenly spaced lines that dim slowly on either side of center.

![Part a of the figure shows a slit in a vertical bar. To the right of the bar is a graph of intensity versus height. The graph is turned ninety degrees counterclockwise so that the intensity scale increases to the left and the height increases as you go up the page. Just in front of the gap, a strong central peak extends leftward from the graph’s baseline, and many smaller satellite peaks appear above and below this central peak. Part b of the figure shows a drawing of the two-dimensional intensity pattern that is observed from single slit diffraction. The central stripe is quite broad compared to the satellite stripes, and there are dark areas between all the stripes.](../resources/Figure_27_05_01.jpg '(a) Single slit diffraction pattern. Monochromatic light passing through a single slit has a central maximum and many smaller and dimmer maxima on either side. The central maximum is six times higher than shown. (b) The drawing shows the bright central maximum and dimmer and thinner maxima on either side.')
{: #Figure1}

The analysis of single slit diffraction is illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)
. Here we consider light coming from different parts of the _same_ slit.
According to Huygens’s principle, every part of the wavefront in the slit emits
wavelets. These are like rays that start out in phase and head in all
directions. (Each ray is perpendicular to the wavefront of a wavelet.) Assuming
the screen is very far away compared with the size of the slit, rays heading
toward a common destination are nearly parallel. When they travel straight
ahead, as in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(a), they remain in phase, and a central
maximum is obtained. However, when rays travel at an angle $$\theta $$ relative
to the original direction of the beam, each travels a different distance to a
common location, and they can arrive in or out of phase.
In [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(b), the ray from the bottom travels a distance of one
wavelength $$\lambda $$ farther than the ray from the top. Thus a ray from the
center travels a distance $$\lambda /2 $$ farther than the one on the left,
arrives out of phase, and interferes destructively. A ray from slightly above
the center and one from slightly above the bottom will also cancel one another.
In fact, each ray from the slit will have another to interfere destructively,
and a minimum in intensity will occur at this angle. There will be another
minimum at the same angle to the right of the incident direction of the light.

![The figure shows four schematics of a ray bundle passing through a single slit. The slit is represented as a gap in a vertical line. In the first schematic, the ray bundle passes horizontally through the slit. This schematic is labeled theta equals zero and bright. The second schematic is labeled dark and shows the ray bundle passing through the slit an angle of roughly fifteen degrees above the horizontal. The path length difference between the top and bottom ray is lambda, and the schematic is labeled sine theta equals lambda over d. The third schematic is labeled bright and shows the ray bundle passing through the slit at an angle of about twenty five degrees above the horizontal. The path length difference between the top and bottom rays is three lambda over two d, and the schematic is labeled sine theta equals three lambda over two d. The final schematic is labeled dark and shows the ray bundle passing through the slit at an angle of about forty degrees above the horizontal. The path length difference between the top and bottom rays is two lambda over d, and the schematic is labeled sine theta equals two lambda over d.](../resources/Figure_27_05_02.jpg 'Light passing through a single slit is diffracted in all directions and may interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the angle. The difference in path length for rays from either side of the slit is seen to be ( D\\sin \\theta ) .')
{: #Figure2}

At the larger angle shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(c), the path lengths differ
by $$3\lambda /2 $$ for rays from the top and bottom of the slit. One ray
travels a distance $$\lambda $$ different from the ray from the bottom and
arrives in phase, interfering constructively. Two rays, each from slightly above
those two, will also add constructively. Most rays from the slit will have
another to interfere with constructively, and a maximum in intensity will occur
at this angle. However, all rays do not interfere constructively for this
situation, and so the maximum is not as intense as the central maximum. Finally,
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(d), the angle shown is large enough to produce a
second minimum. As seen in the figure, the difference in path length for rays
from either side of the slit is $$D\sin \theta $$ , and we see that a
destructive minimum is obtained when this distance is an integral multiple of
the wavelength.

![The graph shows the variation of intensity as a function of sine theta. The curve has a strong peak at sine theta equals zero, then has small oscillations spreading symmetrically to the left and right of this central peak. The oscillations all appear to be of the same height. Between each oscillation, the curve appears to go to zero, and each zero is labeled. The first zero to the left of the main peak is labeled minus lambda over d and the first zero to the right is labeled lambda over d. The second zero to the left is labeled minus two lambda over d and the second zero to the right is labeled two lambda over d. The third zero to the left is labeled minus three lambda over d and the third zero to the right is labeled three lambda over d.](../resources/Figure_27_05_03.jpg 'A graph of single slit diffraction intensity showing the central maximum to be wider and much more intense than those to the sides.

where $$D $$ is the slit width, $$\lambda $$ is the light’s wavelength, $$\theta $$ is the angle relative to the original direction of the light, and $$m $$ is
the order of the minimum. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a graph of intensity for
single slit interference, and it is apparent that the maxima on either side of
the central maximum are much less intense and not as wide. This is consistent
with the illustration in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(b).

Calculating Single Slit Diffraction
</div>
Visible light of wavelength 550 nm falls on a single slit and produces its second diffraction minimum at an angle of  $$45.0 ^\circ $$
 relative to the incident direction of the light. (a) What is the width of the slit? (b) At what angle is the first minimum produced?

![The schematic shows a single slit to the left and the resulting intensity pattern on a screen is graphed on the right. The single slit is represented by a gap of size d in a vertical line. A ray of wavelength lambda enters the gap from the left, then five rays leave from the gap center and head to the right. One ray continues on the horizontal centerline of the schematic. Two rays angle upward: the first at an unknown angle theta one above the horizontal and the second at an angle theta two equals forty five degrees above the horizontal. The final two rays angle downward at the same angles, so that they are symmetric about the horizontal with respect to the two rays that angle upward. The intensity on the screen is a maximum where the central ray hits the screen, whereas it is a minimum where the angled rays hit the screen.](../resources/Figure_27_05_04.jpg 'A graph of the single slit diffraction pattern is analyzed in this example.')
{: #Figure4}

**Strategy**

From the given information, and assuming the screen is far away from the slit,
we can use the equation $$D\sin \theta = m \lambda $$ first to find $$D $$ , and
again to find the angle for the first minimum $${\theta }_{1} $$.

**Solution for (a)**

We are given that $$\lambda =550 \text{nm} $$ , $$m=2 $$ , and $${\theta }_ {2}=45.0 ^\circ $$ . Solving the equation $$D \sin \theta =m \lambda $$ for
$$D $$ and substituting known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}D& =& \frac{\m \lambda}{ \sin {\theta }_{2}}=\frac{2\left(550 \text{nm}\right)}{\sin 45.0\text{º}}\\ 
 D & =& \frac{1100 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}}{0.707}\\ 
 D & =&  1.56 \times 10^{-6} \text{m} .\end{array} $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

Solving the equation $$D \sin \theta = m \lambda $$ for $$\sin {\theta }_{1} $$
and substituting the known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{1}=\frac{m \lambda}{D}=\frac{1\left(550 \times 10^{-9}  \text{m}\right)}{ 1.56 \times 10^{-6}  \text{m}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Thus the angle  $${\theta }_{1} $$  is

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{1}={\sin}^{-1} 0.354=20.7 \text{º.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

We see that the slit is narrow (it is only a few times greater than the
wavelength of light). This is consistent with the fact that light must interact
with an object comparable in size to its wavelength in order to exhibit
significant wave effects such as this single slit diffraction pattern. We also
see that the central maximum extends $$20.7 ^\circ $$ on either side of the
original beam, for a width of about $$41 ^\circ $$ . The angle between the
first and second minima is only about $$24 ^\circ \left(45.0 \text{º}-20.7º\right) $$ . Thus the second maximum is only about half as wide as
the central maximum.

</div>

### Section Summary

- A single slit produces an interference pattern characterized by a broad
  central maximum with narrower and dimmer maxima to the sides.
- There is destructive interference for a single slit when $$D \sin \theta =m \lambda, \left( \text{ for } m=1 \text{,} -1 \text{,} 2 \text{,} -2 \text{,} 3 \text{,} \dots \right) $$ , where $$D $$ is the slit width, $$\lambda $$ is
  the light’s wavelength, $$\theta $$ is the angle relative to the original
  direction of the light, and $$m $$ is the order of the minimum. Note that
  there is no $$m=0 $$ minimum.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
As the width of the slit producing a single-slit diffraction pattern is reduced, how will the diffraction pattern produced change?

</div>
</div>

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) At what angle is the first minimum for 550-nm light falling on a single slit of width  $$ 1.00 \text{μm} $$ ?
 (b) Will there be a second minimum?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For single-slit diffraction, minima (dark fringes) occur at angles given by $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$, where D is the slit width, λ is the wavelength, and m = 1, 2, 3, ... (m = 0 would be the central maximum, not a minimum). We solve for θ for m = 1, then check if m = 2 is physically possible.

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 550 \text{ nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- Slit width: $$D = 1.00 \text{ μm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$

**(a) First minimum (m = 1):**

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta_1 = m\lambda = (1)\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{1.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.550$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \arcsin(0.550) = 33.4°$$
</div>

**The first minimum occurs at 33.4°.**

**(b) Second minimum (m = 2):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{D} = \frac{2(550 \times 10^{-9})}{1.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 1.10$$
</div>

Since $$\sin \theta$$ cannot exceed 1, **there is no second minimum.** The value of 1.10 is physically impossible.

**Discussion**

When the slit width is comparable to the wavelength (D ≈ λ), the diffraction pattern becomes very broad. In this case, D = 1.00 μm and λ = 550 nm, giving a ratio of D/λ ≈ 1.82. The first minimum appears at 33.4°, which is a large angle indicating significant spreading of light. For a second minimum to exist, we would need D ≥ 2λ, but here D < 2λ (1000 nm < 1100 nm). This demonstrates that narrower slits produce wider diffraction patterns. When D < 2λ, only the central maximum and first-order minima exist; the diffraction pattern has only three regions: one minimum on each side of the central maximum.

(a) Calculate the angle at which a  $$ 2.00\text{-μm} $$
-wide slit produces its first minimum for 410-nm violet light. (b) Where is the first minimum for 700-nm red light?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a single slit, the first minimum occurs when $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1. We solve for θ for each wavelength.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$D = 2.00 \text{ μm} = 2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$

**(a) For violet light (λ = 410 nm):**

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$
</div>

With m = 1:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{410 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 0.205$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.205) = 11.8°$$
</div>

**(b) For red light (λ = 700 nm):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{700 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 0.350$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.350) = 20.5°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first minimum for red light (20.5°) occurs at a larger angle than for violet light (11.8°), which makes sense because red light has a longer wavelength. This illustrates the wavelength dependence of diffraction: longer wavelengths diffract more. The central maximum for red light is therefore wider than for violet light. This is why when white light passes through a single slit, the central maximum appears white but has reddish edges (red diffracts farther) and bluish/violet closer to the center.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) How wide is a single slit that produces its first minimum for 633-nm light at an angle of  $$ 28.0º $$ ?
 (b) At what angle will the second minimum be?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem gives us the angle of the first minimum and asks us to find the slit width. We use $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1, solving for D. Then we find the second minimum (m = 2) using the calculated slit width.

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 633 \text{ nm} = 633 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- First minimum angle: $$\theta_1 = 28.0°$$
- First minimum: $$m = 1$$

**(a) Slit width:**

For the first minimum:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta_1 = m\lambda = (1)\lambda$$
</div>

Solving for D:

<div class="equation">
$$D = \frac{\lambda}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{633 \times 10^{-9}}{\sin 28.0°} = \frac{633 \times 10^{-9}}{0.469}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D = 1.35 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.35 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

**The slit width is 1.35 × 10⁻⁶ m (or 1.35 μm).**

**(b) Second minimum:**

For the second minimum (m = 2):

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{D} = \frac{2(633 \times 10^{-9})}{1.35 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1266 \times 10^{-9}}{1.35 \times 10^{-6}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = 0.938$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.938) = 69.9°$$
</div>

**The second minimum occurs at 69.9°.**

**Discussion**

The slit width of 1.35 μm is about twice the wavelength (633 nm), which allows for a second minimum to exist. The large angle for the second minimum (69.9°) means it's very close to the theoretical maximum of 90°. A third minimum would require sin θ₃ = 3λ/D = 1.41, which is impossible, so this diffraction pattern has only two minima on each side of the central maximum. The 633-nm wavelength is characteristic of a helium-neon (He-Ne) laser, commonly used in diffraction experiments due to its monochromaticity and coherence.

(a) What is the width of a single slit that produces its first minimum at  $$ 60.0º $$
 for 600-nm light? (b) Find the wavelength of light that has its first minimum at  $$ 62.0º $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 to solve for D. For part (b), we use the same slit width D and solve for λ at the new angle.

**Solution**

**(a) Slit width for 600-nm light at 60.0°:**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 600 \text{ nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$\theta = 60.0°$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first minimum)

Using $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$D = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{(1)(600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{\sin 60.0°}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9}}{0.8660} = 6.93 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 693 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**(b) Wavelength with first minimum at 62.0°:**

Using the same slit width:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = D \sin \theta = (6.93 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}) \sin 62.0°$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = (6.93 \times 10^{-7})(0.8829) = 6.12 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 612 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The slit width of 693 nm is remarkably small - just slightly larger than the wavelength of the light itself. When D ≈ λ, the diffraction pattern is very spread out, with the first minimum at 60°. This creates a very wide central maximum spanning 120° total (60° on each side).

For part (b), the slightly larger angle (62.0° vs 60.0°) corresponds to a slightly longer wavelength (612 nm vs 600 nm), which makes physical sense. Both wavelengths are in the orange-red portion of the visible spectrum. This problem demonstrates that when the slit width is comparable to the wavelength, single-slit diffraction effects are very pronounced.

Find the wavelength of light that has its third minimum at an angle of  $$ 48.6º $$
 when it falls on a single slit of width  $$ 3.00 \text{μm} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the single-slit diffraction formula $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 3 (third minimum) and solve for the wavelength λ.

**Solution**

Given:
- Slit width: $$D = 3.00 \text{ μm} = 3.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- Third minimum angle: $$\theta = 48.6°$$
- Order: $$m = 3$$

For the third minimum:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$
</div>

Solving for wavelength:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{D \sin \theta}{m} = \frac{(3.00 \times 10^{-6}) \sin 48.6°}{3}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{(3.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.7501)}{3} = \frac{2.250 \times 10^{-6}}{3}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = 7.50 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 750 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**The wavelength is 750 nm, which corresponds to red light.**

**Discussion**

A wavelength of 750 nm is at the red end of the visible spectrum (approximately 620-750 nm). The relatively large slit width (3.00 μm = 4 wavelengths) allows multiple minima to exist on each side of the central maximum. For m = 3 to occur at a reasonable angle (48.6°), the ratio D/λ = 4.0, which means the slit is exactly 4 wavelengths wide. This is a favorable condition for observing multiple diffraction orders. If we checked for a fourth minimum (m = 4), we would find sin θ₄ = 4(750)/3000 = 1.0, meaning the fourth minimum just barely exists at θ = 90° (grazing angle along the screen).

Calculate the wavelength of light that produces its first minimum at an angle of  $$ 36.9º $$
 when falling on a single slit of width  $$ 1.00 \text{μm} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For the first minimum of a single slit, we use $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 and solve for the wavelength λ.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$D = 1.00 \text{ μm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- $$\theta = 36.9°$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first minimum)

Using the single-slit diffraction equation:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$
</div>

Solving for λ:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{D \sin \theta}{m} = \frac{(1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}) \sin 36.9°}{1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.6000) = 6.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 600 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The wavelength of 600 nm corresponds to orange light, which is in the visible spectrum. The angle of 36.9° is relatively large for a first minimum, indicating that the slit width (1.00 μm) is not much larger than the wavelength. Specifically, D/λ = 1.00 μm / 600 nm ≈ 1.67, meaning the slit is less than twice the wavelength.

This problem nicely demonstrates that sin(36.9°) = 0.6 = 3/5, which comes from a 3-4-5 right triangle, a common value that appears in physics problems. The result is reasonable because it falls within the visible light range (380-760 nm).

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 2 (second minimum) to find the angle. For part (b), the highest-order minimum occurs when sin θ approaches 1 (angle approaches 90°), so we solve for the maximum m such that mλ/D ≤ 1.

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 589 \text{ nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- Slit width: $$D = 7.50 \text{ μm} = 7.50 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$

**(b) Highest-order minimum:**

The highest order occurs when sin θ = 1 (at θ = 90°):

$$m_{\text{max}} = \frac{D}{\lambda} = \frac{7.50 \times 10^{-6}}{589 \times 10^{-9}} = 12.73$$

Since m must be an integer, the highest-order minimum is:

We can verify: $$\sin \theta_{12} = \frac{12(589)}{7500} = 0.943$$, giving $$\theta_{12} = 70.6°$$ (valid).

For m = 13: $$\sin \theta_{13} = \frac{13(589)}{7500} = 1.021 > 1$$ (impossible).

**The highest-order minimum is m = 12.**

Sodium vapor light (589 nm average of the D-line doublet at 589.0 and 589.6 nm) is commonly used in spectroscopy and diffraction experiments. The relatively large slit width (7.50 μm ≈ 12.7λ) allows many diffraction orders. The small angle for the second minimum (9.04°) indicates that higher-order minima are closely spaced near the central maximum but spread out at larger angles. The 12th-order minimum appears at about 70.6°, showing how the diffraction pattern extends over a wide angular range. This creates a complex pattern with 13 bright regions: the central maximum plus 12 secondary maxima on each side.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Following the Problem-Solving Strategies for Wave Optics:

**Step 1:** This is a single slit diffraction problem.
**Step 2:** We use the single-slit equation $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ for minima.
**Step 3:** We need to find (a) the angle θ for the third minimum, and (b) the slit width D that places this minimum at 85.0°.
**Step 4:** Given: λ = 633 nm, D = 20.0 μm for part (a); θ = 85.0° for part (b).
**Step 5:** For part (a), solve for θ. For part (b), solve for D.

**Solution**

**(a) Angle of third minimum:**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 633 \text{ nm} = 633 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$D = 20.0 \text{ μm} = 20.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- $$m = 3$$ (third minimum)

Using $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{D} = \frac{3 \times 633 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{20.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{1899 \times 10^{-9}}{20.0 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.09495$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.09495) = 5.45°$$
</div>

**(b) Slit width for third minimum at 85.0°:**

<div class="equation">
$$D = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{3 \times 633 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{\sin 85.0°}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D = \frac{1899 \times 10^{-9}}{0.9962} = 1.91 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.91 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

**Step 6:** Check reasonableness: For (a), the small angle makes sense because D >> λ. For (b), the smaller slit width creates more spreading.

**Discussion**

The third minimum at only 5.45° for a 20.0-μm slit indicates that D is much larger than λ (about 32 times). This produces a tight, narrow diffraction pattern with many observable minima.

For part (b), placing the third minimum at 85.0° (near grazing angle) requires a much smaller slit (1.91 μm), comparable to the wavelength. This demonstrates that smaller slits produce more spreading. The ratio D/λ changes from 31.6 in part (a) to only 3.0 in part (b), showing how dramatically the pattern spreads when the slit width decreases.

(a) Find the angle between the first minima for the two sodium vapor lines, which have wavelengths of 589.1 and 589.6 nm, when they fall upon a single slit of width  $$ 2.00 \text{μm} $$ .
 (b) What is the distance between these minima if the diffraction pattern falls on a screen 1.00 m from the slit? (c) Discuss the ease or difficulty of measuring such a distance.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For each sodium D-line wavelength, we calculate the angle of the first minimum using $$D \sin \theta = \lambda$$. The angle difference gives us part (a). For part (b), we use geometry to find the separation on the screen using $$y = L \tan \theta$$ or the small angle approximation $$\Delta y \approx L \Delta \theta$$ (with Δθ in radians).

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelengths: $$\lambda_1 = 589.1 \text{ nm}$$ and $$\lambda_2 = 589.6 \text{ nm}$$
- Slit width: $$D = 2.00 \text{ μm} = 2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- Screen distance: $$L = 1.00 \text{ m}$$

**(a) Angle between first minima:**

For the first minimum (m = 1) of each wavelength:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda_1}{D} = \frac{589.1 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.29455$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \arcsin(0.29455) = 17.125°$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{\lambda_2}{D} = \frac{589.6 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.29480$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.29480) = 17.140°$$
</div>

The angle difference is:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = 17.140° - 17.125° = 0.0150°$$
</div>

**The angle between the first minima is 0.0150°.**

**(b) Distance on screen:**

Converting the angle difference to radians:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta_{\text{rad}} = 0.0150° \times \frac{\pi}{180°} = 2.618 \times 10^{-4} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

For small angle differences, the separation on the screen is approximately:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta y = L \Delta \theta_{\text{rad}} = (1.00 \text{ m})(2.618 \times 10^{-4}) = 2.62 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta y = 0.262 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**The distance between the minima on the screen is 0.262 mm.**

**(c) Ease of measurement:**

A separation of 0.262 mm (about one-quarter millimeter) is **not easily measured by the naked human eye**, which can typically resolve details down to about 0.1 mm at best under ideal conditions. However, this distance is **quite easily measurable with basic optical aids**:
- Under a microscope or magnifying glass
- With a precision ruler or calipers
- Using digital imaging and analysis software
- With a traveling microscope used in physics labs

This measurement demonstrates the resolving power of single-slit diffraction. The sodium D-lines differ by only 0.5 nm (less than 0.1% difference), yet single-slit diffraction can spatially separate them sufficiently to be measured with modest equipment. This technique forms the basis of spectroscopy for measuring small wavelength differences.

**Discussion**

The small angular separation (0.0150°) between the two sodium D-lines highlights the challenge of spectral resolution. The wavelength difference is Δλ = 0.5 nm out of λ ≈ 589 nm, giving a fractional difference of about 0.08%. The ability to distinguish these lines depends on having sharp, well-defined minima, which requires coherent, monochromatic light sources. Sodium vapor lamps produce these doublet lines due to the fine structure of sodium's electronic energy levels. This problem demonstrates why high-resolution spectroscopy requires careful optical design and precise measurements.

(a) What is the minimum width of a single slit (in multiples of  $$\lambda  $$ )
that will produce a first minimum for a wavelength  $$\lambda  $$ ?
 (b) What is its minimum width if it produces 50 minima? (c) 1000 minima?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To produce minima, we need $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$. The minimum slit width occurs when the highest-order minimum appears at θ = 90° (where $$\sin \theta = 1$$).

**Solution**

**(a) Minimum width for a first minimum:**

For the first minimum (m = 1), it must be observable at some angle $$\theta < 90°$$. The absolute minimum occurs when it appears exactly at θ = 90°:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin 90° = 1 \times \lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D_{\text{min}} = \lambda$$
</div>

So the minimum width is **1λ** (one wavelength).

**(b) Minimum width for 50 minima:**

If there are 50 minima on one side of the central maximum, the 50th minimum must appear at or before θ = 90°:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin 90° = 50\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D_{\text{min}} = 50\lambda$$
</div>

The minimum width is **50λ**.

**(c) Minimum width for 1000 minima:**

Similarly, for 1000 minima:

<div class="equation">
$$D \sin 90° = 1000\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$D_{\text{min}} = 1000\lambda$$
</div>

The minimum width is **1000λ**.

**Discussion**

These results reveal an important principle: the maximum number of observable minima equals D/λ (when rounded down to the nearest integer). For example:
- If D = λ, you can have at most 1 minimum (barely observable at 90°)
- If D = 50λ, you can have at most 50 minima
- If D = 1000λ, you can have at most 1000 minima

This makes physical sense: wider slits (in units of wavelength) produce more closely-spaced minima and can fit more of them before reaching the 90° limit.

For visible light (λ ≈ 500 nm), a slit width of 1000λ = 0.5 mm would produce 1000 minima on each side, for 2000 minima total (plus the central maximum), creating an extremely dense pattern. In practice, these higher-order minima become very faint and difficult to observe.

(d) Use your answers to illustrate how the angular width of the central maximum is about twice the angular width of the next maximum (which is the angle between the first and second minima).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Given the first minimum angle, we can determine the ratio D/λ. From this, we calculate angles for higher-order minima using $$D \sin \theta_m = m\lambda$$, which can be rewritten as $$\sin \theta_m = m \sin \theta_1$$ since $$D = \lambda/\sin \theta_1$$.

**Solution**

Given:
- First minimum angle: $$\theta_1 = 14.5°$$

From the first minimum (m = 1):
<div class="equation">
$$D \sin \theta_1 = \lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{D}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\sin 14.5°} = \frac{1}{0.2504} = 3.994$$
</div>

**(a) Second-order minimum (m = 2):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{D} = 2 \sin \theta_1 = 2(0.2504) = 0.5008$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.5008) = 30.1°$$
</div>

**The second-order minimum occurs at 30.1°.**

**(b) Third-order minimum (m = 3):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_3 = \frac{3\lambda}{D} = 3 \sin \theta_1 = 3(0.2504) = 0.7512$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_3 = \arcsin(0.7512) = 48.7°$$
</div>

**The third-order minimum occurs at 48.7°.**

**(c) Fourth-order minimum (m = 4):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_4 = 4 \sin \theta_1 = 4(0.2504) = 1.002 > 1$$
</div>

Since $$\sin \theta$$ cannot exceed 1, **there is no fourth-order minimum.**

**(d) Comparison of angular widths:**

The **central maximum** extends from $$-\theta_1$$ to $$+\theta_1$$, so its angular width is:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Width of central maximum} = 2\theta_1 = 2(14.5°) = 29.0°$$
</div>

The **first secondary maximum** lies between the first and second minima, so its angular width is:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Width of first secondary maximum} = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = 30.1° - 14.5° = 15.6°$$
</div>

Comparing these:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{2\theta_1}{\theta_2 - \theta_1} = \frac{29.0°}{15.6°} = 1.86 \approx 2$$
</div>

Alternatively: $$2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = 2(15.6°) = 31.2° \approx 29.0°$$

This demonstrates that **the central maximum is approximately twice as wide as the first secondary maximum.**

**Discussion**

This 2:1 width ratio is a characteristic feature of single-slit diffraction patterns. The central maximum is both wider and much brighter than any secondary maxima. The theoretical intensity at the central maximum is proportional to $$(D/\lambda)^2$$, while secondary maxima have much lower intensities (roughly 4.5% for the first secondary maximum).

The fact that the slit width D ≈ 4λ means this pattern has exactly three observable minima (m = 1, 2, 3) before reaching the limit at 90°. The progression of angles (14.5°, 30.1°, 48.7°) shows how minima become increasingly spread out at higher orders, a consequence of the nonlinear relationship between θ and m through the sine function.

**Integrated Concepts**

A water break at the entrance to a harbor consists of a rock barrier with a
50.0-m-wide opening. Ocean waves of 20.0-m wavelength approach the opening
straight on. At what angle to the incident direction are the boats inside the
harbor most protected against wave action?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is a single-slit diffraction problem applied to ocean waves. The harbor opening acts as a slit, and boats are most protected at angles corresponding to diffraction minima, where wave intensity is minimized. We use $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ to find these angles.

**Solution**

Given:
- Opening width (slit): $$D = 50.0 \text{ m}$$
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 20.0 \text{ m}$$

Boats are most protected at the minima of the diffraction pattern:

**First minimum (m = 1):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{20.0 \text{ m}}{50.0 \text{ m}} = 0.400$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \arcsin(0.400) = 23.6°$$
</div>

**Second minimum (m = 2):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{D} = \frac{2(20.0 \text{ m})}{50.0 \text{ m}} = 0.800$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.800) = 53.1°$$
</div>

**Check for third minimum (m = 3):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_3 = \frac{3\lambda}{D} = \frac{3(20.0)}{50.0} = 1.20 > 1 \text{ (impossible)}$$
</div>

**Boats inside the harbor are most protected at angles of 23.6° and 53.1° from the incident direction.**

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates a practical application of wave diffraction. The harbor opening (50.0 m) is 2.5 times the wavelength (20.0 m), creating a clear diffraction pattern. At the minimum angles (23.6° and 53.1°), destructive interference significantly reduces wave amplitude, providing calmer water for moored boats.

The central maximum (0° to 23.6° on each side) experiences strong wave action, as do the secondary maxima between the minima. Therefore, boats should ideally be positioned at 23.6° or 53.1° from the opening's centerline for maximum protection. The lack of a third minimum (which would require sin θ > 1) means there are only two protected zones on each side of the harbor.

This same principle applies to:
- Sound passing through doorways
- Light through narrow apertures
- Radio waves passing around obstacles

The key insight is that diffraction provides natural "quiet zones" at specific angles, and harbor design can exploit this by positioning docks and moorings at these protected angles. For ocean waves with typical wavelengths of 10-30 m, harbor entrances of 25-100 m create significant diffraction effects.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
**Integrated Concepts**

An aircraft maintenance technician walks past a tall hangar door that acts like
a single slit for sound entering the hangar. Outside the door, on a line
perpendicular to the opening in the door, a jet engine makes a 600-Hz sound. At
what angle with the door will the technician observe the first minimum in sound
intensity if the vertical opening is 0.800 m wide and the speed of sound is 340
m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is a single-slit diffraction problem for sound waves. First, we find the wavelength of sound using $$v = f\lambda$$. Then we use the single-slit equation $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 for the first minimum.

**Solution**

**Step 1: Find the wavelength of sound**

Given:
- $$f = 600 \text{ Hz}$$
- $$v = 340 \text{ m/s}$$

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{340 \text{ m/s}}{600 \text{ Hz}} = 0.567 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the angle of the first minimum**

Given:
- $$D = 0.800 \text{ m}$$ (door width)
- $$m = 1$$ (first minimum)
- $$\lambda = 0.567 \text{ m}$$

Using $$D \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{D} = \frac{(1)(0.567 \text{ m})}{0.800 \text{ m}} = 0.709$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.709) = 45.1°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first minimum occurs at 45.1° from the perpendicular to the door. This relatively large angle demonstrates that sound diffracts significantly around the opening because the wavelength (0.567 m) is comparable to the door width (0.800 m). The ratio D/λ = 0.800/0.567 ≈ 1.41, which is small, so diffraction effects are pronounced.

This explains why the technician can hear the jet engine even when not directly in line with the door opening - sound bends around the edges of the door. In contrast, if this were light (λ ≈ 500 nm), the ratio D/λ would be about 1.6 million, producing an essentially sharp-edged shadow with the first minimum at an extremely small angle.

This problem beautifully illustrates why sound "bends around corners" while light appears to travel in straight lines - it's all about the ratio of wavelength to obstacle size.
