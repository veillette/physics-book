The water vapor is shown to emerge out of the nozzle of the kettle.](../resources/Figure_15_01_01.jpg 'This boiling tea kettle represents energy in motion. The water in the kettle is turning to water vapor because heat is being transferred from the stove to the kettle. As the entire system gets hotter, work is done—from the evaporation of the water to the whistling of the kettle. (credit: Gina Hamilton)')

If we are interested in how heat transfer is converted into doing work, then the
conservation of energy principle is important. The first law of thermodynamics
applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat transfer and
doing work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the system.
The **first law of thermodynamics** states that the change in internal energy of
a system equals the net heat transfer **into** the system minus the net work
done **by** the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U=Q-W\text{.} $$
</div>

Here $$\Delta U $$ is the *change in internal energy*  $$U $$ of the system. $$Q
$$ is the **net heat transferred into the system**—that is, $$Q $$ is the sum of
all heat transfer into and out of the system. $$W $$ is the **net work done by
the system**—that is, $$W $$ is the sum of all work done on or by the system. We
use the following sign conventions: if $$Q $$ is positive, then there is a net
heat transfer into the system; if $$W $$ is positive, then there is net work
done by the system. So positive $$Q $$ adds energy to the system and positive
$$W $$ takes energy from the system. Thus, $$\Delta U=Q-W $$ . Note also that if
more heat transfer into the system occurs than work done, the difference is
stored as internal energy. Heat engines are a good example of this—heat transfer
into them takes place so that they can do work. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) We
will now examine $$Q $$ , $$W $$ , and $$\Delta U $$ further.
![The figure shows a schematic diagram of a system shown by an ellipse. Heat Q is shown to enter the system as shown by a bold arrow toward the ellipse. The work done is shown pointing away from the system. The internal energy of the system is marked as delta U equals Q minus W. The second part of the figure shows two arrow diagrams for the heat change Q and work W. Q is shown as Q in minus Q out. W is shown as W out minus W in.](../resources/Figure_15_01_02.jpg 'The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation-of-energy principle stated for a system where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy for a system in thermal equilibrium.

Making Connections: Law of Thermodynamics and Law of Conservation of Energy
</div>
The first law of thermodynamics is actually the law of conservation of energy stated in a form most useful in thermodynamics. The first law gives the relationship between heat transfer, work done, and the change in internal energy of a system.

</div>

### Heat _Q_ and Work _W_

Heat transfer ( $$Q $$ )
and doing work ( $$W $$ )
are the two everyday means of bringing energy into or taking energy out of a
system. The processes are quite different. Heat transfer, a less organized
process, is driven by temperature differences. Work, a quite organized process,
involves a macroscopic force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and
work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature
increase. Heat transfer into a system, such as when the Sun warms the air in a
bicycle tire, can increase its temperature, and so can work done on the system,
as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has
occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat transfer or by
doing work. This uncertainty is an important point. Heat transfer and work are
both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can
change the internal energy $$U $$ of a system. Internal energy is a form of
energy completely different from either heat or work.

### Internal Energy _U_

We can think about the internal energy of a system in two different but
consistent ways. The first is the atomic and molecular view, which examines the
system on the atomic and molecular scale. The **internal energy** $$U $$ of a
system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and
molecules. Recall that kinetic plus potential energy is called mechanical
energy. Thus, internal energy is the sum of atomic and molecular mechanical
energy. Because it is impossible to keep track of all individual atoms and
molecules, we must deal with averages and distributions. A second way to view
the internal energy of a system is in terms of its macroscopic characteristics,
which are very similar to atomic and molecular average values.

Macroscopically, we define the change in internal energy $$\Delta U $$ to be
that given by the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U=Q-W\text{.} $$
</div>

Many detailed experiments have verified that $$\Delta U=Q-W $$ , where $$\Delta
U $$ is the change in total kinetic and potential energy of all atoms and
molecules in a system. It has also been determined experimentally that the
internal energy $$U $$ of a system depends only on the state of the system
and \*_not how it reached that state_.\* More specifically, $$U $$ is found to be
a function of a few macroscopic quantities (pressure, volume, and temperature,
for example), independent of past history such as whether there has been heat
transfer or work done. This independence means that if we know the state of a
system, we can calculate changes in its internal energy $$U $$ from a few
macroscopic variables.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Making Connections: Macroscopic and Microscopic
</div>
In thermodynamics, we often use the macroscopic picture when making calculations of how a system behaves, while the atomic and molecular picture gives underlying explanations in terms of averages and distributions. We shall see this again in later sections of this chapter. For example, in the topic of entropy, calculations will be made using the atomic and molecular view.

</div>

To get a better idea of how to think about the internal energy of a system, let
us examine a system going from State 1 to State 2. The system has internal
energy $${U}_{1} $$ in State 1, and it has internal energy $${U}_{2} $$ in State
2, no matter how it got to either state. So the change in internal energy
$$\Delta U={U}_{2}-{U}_{1} $$ is independent of what caused the change. In other
words, $$\Delta U $$
_is independent of path_. By path, we mean the method of getting from the
starting point to the ending point. Why is this independence important? Note
that $$\Delta U=Q-W $$ . Both $$Q $$ and $$W $$
_depend on path_, but $$\Delta U $$ does not. This path independence means that
internal energy $$U $$ is easier to consider than either heat transfer or work
done.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Change in Internal Energy: The Same Change in
 $$U $$ is Produced by Two Different Processes
</div>
(a) Suppose there is heat transfer of 40.00 J to a system, while the system does 10.00 J of work. Later, there is heat transfer of 25.00 J out of the system while 4.00 J of work is done on the system. What is the net change in internal energy of the system?

(b) What is the change in internal energy of a system when a total of 150.00 J
of heat transfer occurs out of (from) the system and 159.00 J of work is done on
the system? (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)).

**Strategy**

In part (a), we must first find the net heat transfer and net work done from the
given information. Then the first law of thermodynamics $$\left(\Delta
U=Q-W\right) $$ can be used to find the change in internal energy. In part (b),
the net heat transfer and work done are given, so the equation can be used
directly.

**Solution for (a)**

The net heat transfer is the heat transfer into the system minus the heat
transfer out of the system, or

<div class="equation">
 $$Q= 40.00 \text{J}-25.00 \text{J}= 15.00  \text{J} . $$
</div>
Similarly, the total work is the work done by the system minus the work done on the system, or

<div class="equation">
 $$W= 10.00 \text{J} -4.00\text{J}=6.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
Thus the change in internal energy is given by the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U=Q-W= 15.00 \text{J} -6.00\text{J}=9.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
We can also find the change in internal energy for each of the two steps. First, consider 40.00 J of heat transfer in and 10.00 J of work out, or

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta {U}_{1}={Q}_{1}-{W}_{1}= 40.00 \text{J}- 10.00 \text{J}=30.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
Now consider 25.00 J of heat transfer out and 4.00 J of work in, or

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta {U}_{2}={Q}_{2}-{W}_{2}=- 25.00 \text{J}-\left( -4.00\text{J}\right)=-21.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
The total change is the sum of these two steps, or

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U=\Delta {U}_{1}+\Delta {U}_{2}= 30.00 \text{J}+\left(- 21.00 \text{J} \right)=9.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion on (a)**

No matter whether you look at the overall process or break it into steps, the
change in internal energy is the same.

**Solution for (b)**

Here the net heat transfer and total work are given directly to be $$Q= -150.00
\text{J} $$ and $$W= -159.00 \text{J} $$ , so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta U=Q-W= -150.00 \text{J}-\left(-159.00 \text{J}\right)=9.00 \text{J} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion on (b)**

A very different process in part (b) produces the same 9.00-J change in internal
energy as in part (a). Note that the change in the system in both parts is
related to $$\Delta U $$ and not to the individual $$Q $$ s or $$W $$ s
involved. The system ends up in the **same** state in both (a) and (b). Parts (
a) and (b) present two different paths for the system to follow between the same
starting and ending points, and the change in internal energy for each is the
same—it is independent of path.

(b) Heat transfer removes 150.00 J from the system while work puts 159.00 J into it, producing an increase of 9.00 J in internal energy.

#### Human Metabolism and the First Law of Thermodynamics

**Human metabolism** is the conversion of food into heat transfer, work, and
stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of
thermodynamics in action. We now take another look at these topics via the first
law of thermodynamics. Considering the body as the system of interest, we can
use the first law to examine heat transfer, doing work, and internal energy in
activities ranging from sleep to heavy exercise. What are some of the major
characteristics of heat transfer, doing work, and energy in the body? For one,
body temperature is normally kept constant by heat transfer to the surroundings.
This means $$Q $$ is negative. Another fact is that the body usually does work
on the outside world. This means $$W $$ is positive. In such situations, then,
the body loses internal energy, since $$\Delta U=Q-W $$ is negative.

Now consider the effects of eating. Eating increases the internal energy of the
body by adding chemical potential energy (this is an unromantic view of a good
steak). The body **metabolizes** all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism
is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is
released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Food energy is
reported in a special unit, known as the Calorie. This energy is measured by
burning food in a calorimeter, which is how the units are determined.

In chemistry and biochemistry, one calorie (spelled with a _lowercase_ c) is
defined as the energy (or heat transfer) required to raise the temperature of
one gram of pure water by one degree Celsius. Nutritionists and weight-watchers
tend to use the _dietary_ calorie, which is frequently called a Calorie (spelled
with a _capital_ C). One food Calorie is the energy needed to raise the
temperature of one _kilogram_ of water by one degree Celsius. This means that
one dietary Calorie is equal to one kilocalorie for the chemist, and one must be
careful to avoid confusion between the two.

Again, consider the internal energy the body has lost. There are three places
this internal energy can go—to heat transfer, to doing work, and to stored fat (
a tiny fraction also goes to cell repair and growth). Heat transfer and doing
work take internal energy out of the body, and food puts it back. If you eat
just the right amount of food, then your average internal energy remains
constant. Whatever you lose to heat transfer and doing work is replaced by food,
so that, in the long run, $$\Delta U=0 $$ . If you overeat repeatedly, then
$$\Delta U $$ is always positive, and your body stores this extra internal
energy as fat. The reverse is true if you eat too little. If $$\Delta U $$ is
negative for a few days, then the body metabolizes its own fat to maintain body
temperature and do work that takes energy from the body. This process is how
dieting produces weight loss.

Life is not always this simple, as any dieter knows. The body stores fat or
metabolizes it only if energy intake changes for a period of several days. Once
you have been on a major diet, the next one is less successful because your body
alters the way it responds to low energy intake. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR)
is the rate at which food is converted into heat transfer and work done while
the body is at complete rest. The body adjusts its basal metabolic rate to
partially compensate for over-eating or under-eating. The body will decrease the
metabolic rate rather than eliminate its own fat to replace lost food intake.
You will chill more easily and feel less energetic as a result of the lower
metabolic rate, and you will not lose weight as fast as before. Exercise helps
to lose weight, because it produces both heat transfer from your body and work,
and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest. Weight loss is also
aided by the quite low efficiency of the body in converting internal energy to
work, so that the loss of internal energy resulting from doing work is much
greater than the work done. It should be noted, however, that living systems
are not in thermal<sup />equilibrium.

The body provides us with an excellent indication that many thermodynamic
processes are **irreversible**. An irreversible process can go in one direction
but not the reverse, under a given set of conditions. For example, although body
fat can be converted to do work and produce heat transfer, work done on the body
and heat transfer into it cannot be converted to body fat. Otherwise, we could
skip lunch by sunning ourselves or by walking downstairs. Another example of an
irreversible thermodynamic process is photosynthesis. This process is the intake
of one form of energy—light—by plants and its conversion to chemical potential
energy. Both applications of the first law of thermodynamics are illustrated
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). One great advantage of conservation laws such as the
first law of thermodynamics is that they accurately describe the beginning and
ending points of complex processes, such as metabolism and photosynthesis,
without regard to the complications in between. [[Table 1]](#Table1) presents a
summary of terms relevant to the first law of thermodynamics.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the change in internal energy of a car if you put 12.0 gal of gasoline into its tank? The energy content of gasoline is  $$ 1.3 \times 10^{8}  \text{J/gal} $$ .
 All other factors, such as the car’s temperature, are constant.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the change in internal energy when gasoline is added to the tank, we recognize that adding fuel increases the chemical potential energy of the system. According to the first law of thermodynamics, $$\Delta U = Q - W$$. Since there is no heat transfer ($$Q = 0$$) and no work is done ($$W = 0$$), the change in internal energy equals the energy content of the added fuel. We multiply the volume of gasoline by its energy density to find the total energy added.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Volume of gasoline: $$V = 12.0 \text{ gal}$$
- Energy content of gasoline: $$E_{\text{density}} = 1.3 \times 10^{8} \text{ J/gal}$$

The change in internal energy is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = V \times E_{\text{density}}$$
</div>

Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = 12.0 \text{ gal} \times 1.3 \times 10^{8} \text{ J/gal}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = 1.56 \times 10^{9} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Rounding to two significant figures:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = 1.6 \times 10^{9} \text{ J}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The change in internal energy when adding 12.0 gallons of gasoline to a car is $$1.6 \times 10^{9}$$ J, or 1.6 gigajoules. This enormous amount of energy represents the chemical potential energy stored in the molecular bonds of gasoline. To put this in perspective, this is equivalent to about 444 kilowatt-hours or enough energy to lift a 1000-kg car to a height of about 163 km if perfectly converted to gravitational potential energy. Of course, car engines are only about 20-30% efficient, so only a fraction of this energy actually performs useful work. The rest is dissipated as heat to the environment through the exhaust and cooling system. This calculation assumes the temperature and other thermodynamic properties of the car remain constant during the fueling process, which is reasonable since fueling happens relatively quickly.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
How much heat transfer occurs from a system, if its internal energy decreased by 150 J while it was doing 30.0 J of work?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the first law of thermodynamics, $$\Delta U = Q - W$$, to find the heat transfer. We're given that the internal energy decreased by 150 J (so $$\Delta U = -150$$ J) and the system did 30.0 J of work (so $$W = +30.0$$ J, following the sign convention where work done by the system is positive). Solving for $$Q$$ will give us the net heat transfer. If $$Q$$ is negative, heat flows out of the system.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Change in internal energy: $$\Delta U = -150 \text{ J}$$ (decrease)
- Work done by the system: $$W = 30.0 \text{ J}$$

Using the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = Q - W$$
</div>

Solving for $$Q$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = \Delta U + W$$
</div>

Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = -150 \text{ J} + 30.0 \text{ J}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = -120 \text{ J}$$
</div>

The negative sign indicates that heat flows out of the system, so **120 J of heat transfer occurs from the system to the environment**.

**Discussion**

The system loses 120 J of energy as heat transfer to the environment. This makes physical sense: the system's internal energy decreased by 150 J, but the system also did 30.0 J of work. Since work takes energy out of the system, not all of the 150 J internal energy decrease can be attributed to heat loss—only 120 J is lost as heat. The remaining 30.0 J left the system as mechanical work. This is a common scenario in engines and other heat-converting devices where both work output and heat rejection occur simultaneously. The first law ensures that all energy is accounted for: the 150 J decrease in internal energy equals the sum of work done (30.0 J) and heat transferred out (120 J).

 of heat transfer occurs to the environment. What is the change in internal energy of the system assuming no other changes (such as in temperature or by the addition of fuel)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We apply the first law of thermodynamics, $$\Delta U = Q - W$$. The system does work ($$W = 1.80 \times 10^{8}$$ J is positive), and heat transfer occurs to the environment, meaning heat leaves the system ($$Q$$ is negative). We need to calculate the net heat transfer and then use it to find the change in internal energy.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Work done by the system: $$W = 1.80 \times 10^{8} \text{ J}$$
- Heat transfer to the environment: $$7.50 \times 10^{8} \text{ J}$$ (leaving the system)

Since heat leaves the system, the net heat transfer is:

 $$Q = -7.50 \times 10^{8} \text{ J}$$

**Discussion**

The change in internal energy is $$-9.30 \times 10^{8}$$ J, or $$-930$$ megajoules. The negative value indicates that the system's internal energy has decreased significantly. This makes sense because the system loses energy through two mechanisms: it transfers 750 MJ as heat to the environment and performs 180 MJ of work on the surroundings. The total energy lost (930 MJ) is the sum of these two energy outflows. This scenario might represent a power plant or engine where fuel is burned to produce both useful work and waste heat. The large magnitudes suggest an industrial-scale process. To restore the system to its original energy state, 930 MJ of energy would need to be added, either through heat transfer into the system or by having work done on it.

What is the change in internal energy of a system which does  $$ 4.50 \times 10^{5}  \text{J} $$

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the first law of thermodynamics, $$\Delta U = Q - W$$. First, we must calculate the net heat transfer $$Q$$ by finding the difference between heat entering and heat leaving the system. Heat into the system is positive, and heat out is negative. The system does work, so $$W$$ is positive.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Work done by the system: $$W = 4.50 \times 10^{5} \text{ J}$$
- Heat transfer into the system: $$Q_{\text{in}} = 3.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$
- Heat transfer out of the system: $$Q_{\text{out}} = 8.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$

Calculate the net heat transfer:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = Q_{\text{in}} - Q_{\text{out}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = 3.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J} - 8.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = -5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Now apply the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = Q - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = (-5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}) - (4.50 \times 10^{5} \text{ J})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = -5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ J} - 0.450 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = -5.45 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The internal energy of the system decreases by $$5.45 \times 10^{6}$$ J (5.45 MJ). Although 3.00 MJ of heat enters the system, this is more than offset by 8.00 MJ of heat leaving the system and 0.45 MJ of work done by the system. The net effect is that the system loses 5.45 MJ of internal energy. This could represent a situation where a system simultaneously receives some heat input (perhaps from a small heater) while losing more heat through cooling (perhaps from a large radiator) and also doing mechanical work. The system would need to have an initial store of internal energy (such as in compressed gas or elevated temperature) to sustain this net energy loss. If this process continued indefinitely without adding more energy, the system would eventually cool down and deplete its internal energy.

Suppose a woman does 500 J of work and 9500 J of heat transfer occurs into the environment in the process. (a) What is the decrease in her internal energy, assuming no change in temperature or consumption of food? (That is, there is no other energy transfer.) (b) What is her efficiency?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the first law of thermodynamics, $$\Delta U = Q - W$$. The woman does 500 J of work ($$W = +500$$ J), and 9500 J of heat transfers into the environment, meaning heat leaves her body ($$Q = -9500$$ J). For part (b), efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful work output to total energy input (or in this case, total energy metabolized): $$\text{Eff} = \frac{W}{|\Delta U|}$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Work done by the woman: $$W = 500 \text{ J}$$
- Heat transfer to environment: $$Q = -9500 \text{ J}$$

**(a)** Using the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = Q - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = (-9500 \text{ J}) - (500 \text{ J})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = -10{,}000 \text{ J} = -1.0 \times 10^{4} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Converting to kilocalories (using $$1 \text{ kcal} = 4184 \text{ J}$$):

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = \frac{-10{,}000 \text{ J}}{4184 \text{ J/kcal}} = -2.39 \text{ kcal}$$
</div>

**(b)** Efficiency is the ratio of work done to total energy metabolized:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{W}{|\Delta U|} \times 100\%$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{500 \text{ J}}{10{,}000 \text{ J}} \times 100\% = 5.00\%$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The woman's internal energy decreases by 10,000 J (10.0 kJ or 2.39 kcal). This energy comes from her body's stored chemical energy in the form of ATP, glycogen, and fat. The negative sign confirms that her body loses energy during the activity.

Part (b): Her efficiency is only 5.00%, which is typical for human muscle performance during sustained activity. This means that of all the energy her body metabolizes, only 5% is converted into useful mechanical work—the remaining 95% is dissipated as heat. This low efficiency explains why we get warm during exercise: 9500 J out of 10,000 J (95%) is released as heat that must be dissipated through sweating, increased blood flow to the skin, and increased respiration. This 5% efficiency is actually reasonable for the human body during normal activities. Elite athletes performing specific tasks can achieve efficiencies up to 20-25%, but 5% is common for everyday movements. The heat produced is not wasted from a physiological perspective—it helps maintain body temperature in cold environments, though it becomes a burden requiring active cooling (sweating) in warm conditions or during intense exercise.

(a) How much food energy will a man metabolize in the process of doing 35.0 kJ of work with an efficiency of 5.00%? (b) How much heat transfer occurs to the environment to keep his temperature constant? Explicitly show how you follow the steps in the Problem-Solving Strategy for thermodynamics found
in [Problem-Solving Strategies for Thermodynamics](../contents/ch15ApplicationsOfThermodynamics#Note1).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), efficiency is defined as $$\text{Eff} = \frac{W}{E_{\text{metabolized}}}$$, where $$W$$ is useful work and $$E_{\text{metabolized}}$$ is total food energy metabolized. We solve for $$E_{\text{metabolized}}$$. For part (b), we use the first law of thermodynamics. Since temperature remains constant, $$\Delta U = 0$$. From $$\Delta U = Q - W$$, we can solve for $$Q$$, which represents the heat transfer to the environment.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Work done: $$W = 35.0 \text{ kJ} = 35{,}000 \text{ J}$$
- Efficiency: $$\text{Eff} = 5.00\% = 0.0500$$

**(a)** Using the efficiency equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{W}{E_{\text{metabolized}}}$$
</div>

Solving for $$E_{\text{metabolized}}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{metabolized}} = \frac{W}{\text{Efficiency}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{metabolized}} = \frac{35{,}000 \text{ J}}{0.0500}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{metabolized}} = 700{,}000 \text{ J} = 700 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

**(b)** Since temperature is constant, the change in internal energy is zero:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = 0$$
</div>

Using the first law of thermodynamics:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta U = Q - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$0 = Q - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = W$$
</div>

But this represents net heat transfer. Since the man metabolizes 700 kJ and does 35.0 kJ of work, the heat transferred to the environment is:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{metabolized}} - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = 700 \text{ kJ} - 35.0 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = 665 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The man must metabolize 700 kJ of food energy to perform 35.0 kJ of work at 5.00% efficiency. This is equivalent to about 167 dietary Calories (or food calories). This amount might come from eating an apple, a small banana, or a slice of bread.

Part (b): Of the 700 kJ metabolized, only 35.0 kJ (5%) becomes useful work, while 665 kJ (95%) is released as heat to the environment. This large heat output must be dissipated to keep body temperature constant. The body achieves this through several mechanisms: evaporative cooling (sweating), increased blood flow to the skin (radiation and convection), and increased breathing rate (evaporation from lungs). This explains why physical activity makes us feel warm and why we sweat during exercise—the body must actively cool itself to prevent overheating.

Following the thermodynamics problem-solving strategy:
1. **Identify the system**: The man's body
2. **Identify the process**: Metabolism of food to do work while maintaining constant temperature
3. **Apply relevant principles**: Efficiency definition and first law with $$\Delta U = 0$$
4. **Solve systematically**: Calculate energy input from efficiency, then heat output from energy balance
5. **Check reasonableness**: 665 kJ of heat from 700 kJ metabolized with 35 kJ work is consistent with low efficiency

**Strategy**

For part (a), metabolic rate is power, which is energy per unit time. We divide the total energy metabolized by the time period (one day = 86,400 s). For part (b), we use the efficiency formula: work output equals efficiency times energy input. For part (c), we calculate the motor's work output (power times time) and compare it to the man's work from part (b).

**Solution**

Given values:
- Food energy metabolized: $$E = 10{,}500 \text{ kJ} = 1.05 \times 10^{7} \text{ J}$$
- Time period: $$t = 1 \text{ day} = 24 \text{ hours} = 86{,}400 \text{ s}$$

 $$\frac{W_{\text{motor}}}{W_{\text{man}}} = \frac{1.61 \times 10^{7} \text{ J}}{2.10 \times 10^{6} \text{ J}} = 7.67$$
</div>

The motor produces 7.67 times more work than the man.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The average metabolic rate of 122 W is quite reasonable for a person consuming about 2,500 dietary Calories (10,500 kJ) per day, which is typical for an average adult male. This power output is continuous over 24 hours and includes basal metabolism (maintaining body temperature, heart rate, breathing, cellular processes) plus daily activities. For comparison, this is about the power of a bright incandescent light bulb.

Part (b): At 20% efficiency (optimistic for sustained human activity), the man can do $$2.10 \times 10^{6}$$ J (2.10 MJ) of work. This is equivalent to lifting 10,000 kg through 21.4 m, or climbing about 2,800 steps. The 20% efficiency is higher than typical sustained activity (5-10%) but achievable during optimized movements like cycling.

Part (c): The small 0.250-horsepower motor outperforms the man by a factor of 7.67, producing 16.1 MJ of useful work in 24 hours of continuous operation. This comparison highlights why we use machines for sustained physical labor—even a small motor dramatically outperforms human muscle work. However, humans have advantages in versatility, judgment, and adaptability that machines lack. The comparison also shows that human efficiency, even at an optimistic 20%, means most of our food energy goes to heat, not work. If we needed to match the motor's work output, we'd need to consume about 80 MJ of food energy—roughly 19,000 dietary Calories per day, which is unsustainable.

(a) How long will the energy in a 1470-kJ (350-kcal) cup of yogurt last in a woman doing work at the rate of 150 W with an efficiency of 20.0% (such as in leisurely climbing stairs)? (b) Does the time found in part (a) imply that it is easy to consume more food energy than you can reasonably expect to work off with exercise?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we need to find how long the yogurt's energy lasts. At 20.0% efficiency doing work at 150 W, the woman's metabolic rate (total energy consumption rate) is $$P_{\text{metabolic}} = \frac{P_{\text{work}}}{\text{Efficiency}}$$. Then time is energy divided by metabolic power: $$t = \frac{E}{P_{\text{metabolic}}}$$. For part (b), we consider the implications of this time for diet and exercise.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Energy in yogurt: $$E = 1470 \text{ kJ} = 1{,}470{,}000 \text{ J}$$
- Work power output: $$P_{\text{work}} = 150 \text{ W}$$
- Efficiency: $$\text{Eff} = 20.0\% = 0.200$$

**(a)** First, find the metabolic power (total energy consumption rate):

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{metabolic}} = \frac{P_{\text{work}}}{\text{Efficiency}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{metabolic}} = \frac{150 \text{ W}}{0.200} = 750 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Now calculate the time:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{E}{P_{\text{metabolic}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{1{,}470{,}000 \text{ J}}{750 \text{ W}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$t = 1960 \text{ s}$$
</div>

Converting to minutes:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{1960 \text{ s}}{60 \text{ s/min}} = 32.7 \text{ min}$$
</div>

**(b)** Yes, this result strongly suggests it is very easy to consume more food energy than can be worked off through exercise. A 350-calorie cup of yogurt takes only seconds to consume but requires nearly 33 minutes of continuous stair climbing to burn off. Most people would find 33 minutes of continuous stair climbing quite strenuous.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The energy in a single cup of yogurt (350 dietary Calories) will sustain about 33 minutes of vigorous stair climbing. This might seem like a reasonable duration, but consider the effort level—leisurely stair climbing at 150 W work output is actually quite demanding exercise. For context, this is roughly equivalent to climbing 15-20 flights of stairs.

Part (b): This calculation illustrates a fundamental challenge in weight management: the asymmetry between energy intake and expenditure. The yogurt is consumed in perhaps 2-3 minutes, but requires 33 minutes of sustained, moderately vigorous exercise to burn off. Moreover, this assumes the exercise is the *only* energy expenditure beyond basal metabolism.

Consider further implications:
- At 20% efficiency with 150 W work output, 80% (600 W) becomes heat—this is why stair climbing makes you hot and sweaty
- A typical meal might contain 2,000-3,000 kJ, requiring 2-3 hours of continuous stair climbing to burn off
- Many people cannot sustain 150 W of work output for 33 minutes
- Basal metabolism (60-80 W) is much lower than exercise metabolism (750 W total here)

This explains why diet is often more effective than exercise alone for weight loss—it's much easier to not eat 350 Calories than to burn 350 Calories through exercise. However, exercise has many health benefits beyond calorie burning, including cardiovascular fitness, muscle maintenance, bone density, and mental health.

(a) A woman climbing the Washington Monument metabolizes  $$ 6.00 \times 10^{2}  \text{kJ} $$
 of food energy. If her efficiency is 18.0%, how much heat transfer occurs to the environment to keep her temperature constant? (b) Discuss the amount of heat transfer found in (a). Is it consistent with the fact that you quickly warm up when exercising?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the relationship between metabolized energy, work done, and heat transferred. At 18.0% efficiency, the work done is $$W = 0.180 \times E_{\text{metabolized}}$$. The remaining energy must be dissipated as heat to keep temperature constant. Thus, $$Q_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{metabolized}} - W$$. For part (b), we evaluate whether this heat output is consistent with the body warming during exercise.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Energy metabolized: $$E_{\text{metabolized}} = 6.00 \times 10^{2} \text{ kJ} = 600 \text{ kJ}$$
- Efficiency: $$\text{Eff} = 18.0\% = 0.180$$

**(a)** Calculate the work done:

<div class="equation">
 $$W = \text{Efficiency} \times E_{\text{metabolized}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$W = 0.180 \times 600 \text{ kJ} = 108 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

Calculate the heat transfer to the environment:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{metabolized}} - W$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = 600 \text{ kJ} - 108 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$Q_{\text{out}} = 492 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

**(b)** Yes, this amount of heat transfer is very consistent with rapid warming during exercise. The 492 kJ represents 82% of the total metabolized energy being released as heat.

**Discussion**

Part (a): Of the 600 kJ metabolized while climbing the Washington Monument, 108 kJ (18%) performs the mechanical work of lifting the woman's body against gravity, while 492 kJ (82%) is released as heat to the environment. This 492 kJ is a substantial amount of thermal energy that must be dissipated to prevent the body from overheating.

Part (b): The large heat output (492 kJ) strongly explains why you warm up quickly when exercising. To put this in perspective:
- 492 kJ is enough energy to raise the temperature of 10 liters of water by about 12°C
- If this heat weren't dissipated, it would raise the body temperature of a 60-kg woman by approximately 2°C, which would be dangerous (normal body temperature is 37°C)
- The body must actively cool itself through multiple mechanisms:
  - **Sweating**: Evaporation of sweat removes large amounts of heat (2.4 MJ per liter of sweat evaporated)
  - **Increased breathing**: Exhaled air carries away heat
  - **Vasodilation**: Increased blood flow to skin enhances convective and radiative heat loss
  - **Radiation and convection**: Direct heat transfer to cooler surroundings

The Washington Monument is 169 meters (555 feet) tall with 897 steps. For a 60-kg woman, the gravitational potential energy gain is only about 99 kJ ($$mgh = 60 \times 9.8 \times 169$$), which is close to our calculated 108 kJ of work. The efficiency of 18% is reasonable for climbing, which is one of the more efficient human activities. The high heat output explains why people often feel very warm at the top of a long climb and why good ventilation or cool weather makes climbing more comfortable.
