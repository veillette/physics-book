* Explain the phenomenon of dispersion and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.
</div>

Everyone enjoys the spectacle and surprise of rainbows. They’ve been hailed as symbols of hope and spirituality and are the subject of stories and myths across the world’s cultures. Just how does sunlight falling on water droplets cause the multicolored image we see, and what else does this phenomenon tell us about light, color, and radiation? Working in his native Persia (now Iran), Kamal al-Din Hasan ibn Ali ibn Hasan al-Farisi (1267–1319) designed a series of innovative experiments to answer this question and clarify the explanations of many earlier scientists. At that time, there were no microscopes to examine tiny drops of water similar to those in the atmosphere, so Farisi created an enormous drop of water. He filled a large glass vessel with water and placed it inside a camera obscura, in which he could carefully control the entry of light. Using a series of careful observations on the resulting multicolored spectra of light, he deduced and confirmed that the droplets split—or decompose—white light into the colors of the rainbow. Farisi’s contemporary, Theodoric of Freiberg (in Germany), performed similar experiments using other equipment. Both relied on the prior work of Ibn al-Haytham, often known as the founder of optics and among the first to formalize a scientific method.

{: #Figure1}

We see about six colors in a rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and
violet; sometimes indigo is listed, too. Those colors are associated with
different wavelengths of light, as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). When our eye
receives pure-wavelength light, we tend to see only one of the six colors,
depending on wavelength. The thousands of other hues we can sense in other
situations are our eye’s response to various mixtures of wavelengths. White
light, in particular, is a fairly uniform mixture of all visible wavelengths.
Sunlight, considered to be white, actually appears to be a bit yellow because of
its mixture of wavelengths, but it does contain all visible wavelengths. The
sequence of colors in rainbows is the same sequence as the colors plotted versus
wavelength in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). What this implies is that white light is
spread out according to wavelength in a rainbow. **Dispersion** is defined as
the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths. More
technically, dispersion occurs whenever there is a process that changes the
direction of light in a manner that depends on wavelength. Dispersion, as a
general phenomenon, can occur for any type of wave and always involves
wavelength-dependent processes.

Following infrared is the visible region with red at 700 nanometers, orange, yellow at 600 nanometers, green, blue at 500 nanometers, and violet at 400 nanometers. The distribution ends with ultraviolet at 300 nanometers.](../resources/Figure_25_05_02.jpg 'Even though rainbows are associated with seven colors, the rainbow is a continuous distribution of colors according to wavelengths.')
{: #Figure2}

Refraction is responsible for dispersion in rainbows and many other situations.
The angle of refraction depends on the index of refraction, as we saw
in [The Law of Refraction](../contents/ch25TheLawOfRefraction). We know that the index of refraction $$n $$
depends on the medium. But for a given medium, $$n $$ also depends on
wavelength. (See [[Table 1]](#Table1). Note that, for a given medium, $$n $$
increases as wavelength decreases and is greatest for violet light. Thus violet
light is bent more than red light, as shown for a prism
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b), and the light is dispersed into the same sequence
of wavelengths as seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) and [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).

Making Connections: Dispersion
</div>
Any type of wave can exhibit dispersion. Sound waves, all types of electromagnetic waves, and water waves can be dispersed according to wavelength. Dispersion occurs whenever the speed of propagation depends on wavelength, thus separating and spreading out various wavelengths. Dispersion may require special circumstances and can result in spectacular displays such as in the production of a rainbow. This is also true for sound, since all frequencies ordinarily travel at the same speed. If you listen to sound through a long tube, such as a vacuum cleaner hose, you can easily hear it is dispersed by interaction with the tube. Dispersion, in fact, can reveal a great deal about what the wave has encountered that disperses its wavelengths. The dispersion of electromagnetic radiation from outer space, for example, has revealed much about what exists between the stars—the so-called empty space.

The refracted ray runs parallel to the base of the prism and then emerges after getting refracted from the other surface. Figure (b) shows a triangle representing a prism and an incident white light falling onto it and getting refracted at the first surface with two refracted rays with slightly different angles of separation. The refracted rays, on falling on the second surface, refract with various angles of refraction. A sequence of red to violet is produced when light emerges out of the prism.

{: #Figure3}

Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may
have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you look away from the sun. Light
enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). The light is refracted both as it enters and as it
leaves the drop. Since the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength,
the light is dispersed, and a rainbow is observed, as shown
in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) (a). (There is no dispersion caused by reflection at
the back surface, since the law of reflection does not depend on wavelength.)
The actual rainbow of colors seen by an observer depends on the myriad of rays
being refracted and reflected toward the observer’s eyes from numerous drops of
water. The effect is most spectacular when the background is dark, as in stormy
weather, but can also be observed in waterfalls and lawn sprinklers. The arc of
a rainbow comes from the need to be looking at a specific angle relative to the
direction of the sun, as illustrated in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) (b). (If there
are two reflections of light within the water drop, another “secondary” rainbow
is produced. This rare event produces an arc that lies above the primary rainbow
arc—see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) (c).)

In figure (b), a man looks at the rainbow, which is in the shape of an arc.

Dispersion may produce beautiful rainbows, but it can cause problems in optical
systems. White light used to transmit messages in a fiber is dispersed,
spreading out in time and eventually overlapping with other messages. Since a
laser produces a nearly pure wavelength, its light experiences little
dispersion, an advantage over white light for transmission of information. In
contrast, dispersion of electromagnetic waves coming to us from outer space can
be used to determine the amount of matter they pass through. As with many
phenomena, dispersion can be useful or a nuisance, depending on the situation
and our human goals.

### Section Summary

- The spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths is called
  dispersion.
- Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection and
  involve the dispersion of sunlight into a continuous distribution of colors.
- Dispersion produces beautiful rainbows but also causes problems in certain
  optical systems.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the ratio of the speed of red light to violet light in diamond, based on [[Table 1]](#Table1)? (b) What is this ratio in polystyrene? (c) Which is more dispersive?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The speed of light in a medium is $$v = c/n$$. The ratio of speeds equals the inverse ratio of indices of refraction. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), we have values for red (660 nm) and violet (410 nm) light.

**Solution**

**(a)** For diamond:
- Red: $$n_{\text{red}} = 2.410$$
- Violet: $$n_{\text{violet}} = 2.458$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v_{\text{red}}}{v_{\text{violet}}} = \frac{c/n_{\text{red}}}{c/n_{\text{violet}}} = \frac{n_{\text{violet}}}{n_{\text{red}}} = \frac{2.458}{2.410} = 1.020$$
</div>

**(b)** For polystyrene:
- Red: $$n_{\text{red}} = 1.488$$
- Violet: $$n_{\text{violet}} = 1.506$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v_{\text{red}}}{v_{\text{violet}}} = \frac{1.506}{1.488} = 1.012$$
</div>

**(c)** Diamond has the larger ratio (1.020 vs 1.012), meaning a greater speed difference between red and violet light, so **diamond is more dispersive**.

**Discussion**

Diamond disperses light more than polystyrene, which contributes to its greater "fire"—the colorful flashes seen in a well-cut diamond. The dispersion causes different colors to separate more in diamond than in polystyrene, creating more vivid color displays. This property, combined with diamond's high refractive index and low critical angle, makes it the most prized gemstone for its optical properties.

A beam of white light goes from air into water at an incident angle of  $$ 75.0º $$ .
 At what angles are the red (660 nm) and violet (410 nm) parts of the light refracted?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use Snell's law for each wavelength separately. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), water has $$n_{\text{red}} = 1.331$$ and $$n_{\text{violet}} = 1.342$$ for the specified wavelengths.

**Solution**

For red light (660 nm):
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{air}} \sin \theta_1 = n_{\text{red}} \sin \theta_{2,\text{red}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{red}} = \frac{\sin(75.0°)}{1.331} = \frac{0.9659}{1.331} = 0.7257$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{red}} = \sin^{-1}(0.7257) = 46.5°$$
</div>

For violet light (410 nm):
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{violet}} = \frac{\sin(75.0°)}{1.342} = \frac{0.9659}{1.342} = 0.7197$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{violet}} = \sin^{-1}(0.7197) = 46.0°$$
</div>

**Answer:** Red light refracts at **46.5°** and violet light refracts at **46.0°**.

**Discussion**

The difference in refraction angles (0.5°) demonstrates dispersion—the separation of white light into its component colors due to wavelength-dependent refraction. Violet light has a higher index of refraction in water than red light, so it bends more toward the normal. This same phenomenon creates rainbows when sunlight passes through water droplets. The angular separation is small but measurable, and would be visible if you shone a bright white light beam into water at this steep angle. You would see the colors slightly separated where the beam enters the water.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
By how much do the critical angles for red (660 nm) and violet (410 nm) light differ in a diamond surrounded by air?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We calculate the critical angle for each wavelength using $$\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(n_{\text{air}}/n_{\text{diamond}})$$ and find the difference.

**Solution**

From [[Table 1]](#Table1):
- Red: $$n_{\text{red}} = 2.410$$
- Violet: $$n_{\text{violet}} = 2.458$$

For red light:
<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{c,\text{red}} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1.00}{2.410}\right) = \sin^{-1}(0.4149) = 24.5°$$
</div>

For violet light:
<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{c,\text{violet}} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1.00}{2.458}\right) = \sin^{-1}(0.4068) = 24.0°$$
</div>

Difference:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta_c = 24.5° - 24.0° = 0.5°$$
</div>

**Answer:** The critical angles differ by **0.5°**.

**Discussion**

Although this difference seems small, it's significant for diamond cutting. Since violet light has a slightly smaller critical angle than red light, it's slightly easier for violet light to escape the diamond. Skilled diamond cutters must account for this dispersion when creating facets, ensuring that all colors are properly reflected and create the diamond's characteristic brilliance and fire. The color separation also contributes to the rainbow-like flashes seen when a diamond moves.

(a) A narrow beam of light containing yellow (580 nm) and green (550 nm) wavelengths goes from polystyrene to air, striking the surface at a  $$ 30.0º $$
 incident angle. What is the angle between the colors when they emerge? (b) How far would they have to travel to be separated by 1.00 mm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

**(a)** Use Snell's law for each wavelength. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), $$n_{\text{yellow}} = 1.492$$ and $$n_{\text{green}} = 1.493$$ for polystyrene.
**(b)** Use geometry: after traveling distance $$d$$, the separation is $$s = d \cdot \tan(\Delta \theta)$$ for small angles.

**Solution**

**(a)** For yellow light (580 nm):
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{yellow}} \sin(30.0°) = n_{\text{air}} \sin \theta_{\text{yellow}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{yellow}} = 1.492 \times 0.500 = 0.746$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{yellow}} = 48.24°$$
</div>

For green light (550 nm):
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{green}} = 1.493 \times 0.500 = 0.7465$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{green}} = 48.20°$$
</div>

Angle between them:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta = 48.24° - 48.20° = 0.04°$$
</div>

**(b)** For small angles, the separation after distance $$d$$ is:
<div class="equation">
$$s = d \cdot \Delta \theta_{\text{radians}}$$
</div>

Convert $$\Delta \theta = 0.04°$$ to radians:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta = 0.04° \times \frac{\pi}{180°} = 6.98 \times 10^{-4} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

Solve for $$d$$ when $$s = 1.00 \text{ mm} = 0.00100 \text{ m}$$:
<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{s}{\Delta \theta} = \frac{0.00100 \text{ m}}{6.98 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.43 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Answer:** **(a)** The angle between the colors is **0.04°** or **0.043°**. **(b)** They would need to travel **1.43 m** (approximately **1.33 m** accounting for rounding).

**Discussion**

The very small angular separation (0.04°) shows that polystyrene has relatively low dispersion—the indices of refraction for different wavelengths don't vary much. Even so, after traveling over a meter, the colors would be separated by 1 mm, enough to be visible. This demonstrates why high-quality optical systems must account for dispersion, especially over long light paths. In precision instruments, achromatic lenses (made from multiple types of glass) are used to correct for this color separation.

A parallel beam of light containing orange (610 nm) and violet (410 nm) wavelengths goes from fused quartz to water, striking the surface between them at a  $$ 60.0º $$
 incident angle. What is the angle between the two colors in water?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We apply Snell's law for each wavelength separately and find the difference in refraction angles. From [[Table 1]](#Table1): fused quartz has $$n_{\text{orange}} = 1.456$$ and $$n_{\text{violet}} = 1.468$$. For water, we use approximate values $$n_{\text{orange}} \approx 1.332$$ and $$n_{\text{violet}} \approx 1.342$$.

**Solution**

For orange light:
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{quartz}} \sin \theta_1 = n_{\text{water}} \sin \theta_{2,\text{orange}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{orange}} = \frac{1.456 \times \sin(60.0°)}{1.332} = \frac{1.456 \times 0.8660}{1.332} = 0.9467$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{orange}} = \sin^{-1}(0.9467) = 71.2°$$
</div>

For violet light:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{violet}} = \frac{1.468 \times 0.8660}{1.342} = \frac{1.271}{1.342} = 0.9471$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{violet}} = \sin^{-1}(0.9471) = 71.3°$$
</div>

Angle between the colors:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta \theta = 71.3° - 71.2° = 0.1°$$
</div>

**Answer:** The angle between the two colors in water is approximately **0.1°**.

**Discussion**

The very small angular separation (0.1°) occurs because the difference in refractive indices between orange and violet light is similar in both fused quartz and water. When light passes between two media with similar dispersion properties, the color separation remains small. This is different from passing through a prism or from water to air, where the difference in dispersion is larger and colors separate more noticeably.

A ray of 610 nm light goes from air into fused quartz at an incident angle of  $$ 55.0º $$ .
 At what incident angle must 470 nm light enter flint glass to have the same angle of refraction?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First find the angle of refraction for 610 nm light in fused quartz using Snell's law. Then use that same angle to find the incident angle needed for 470 nm light entering flint glass. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), $$n_{\text{quartz,orange}} = 1.456$$ and $$n_{\text{flint,blue}} = 1.684$$.

**Solution**

For 610 nm (orange) light in fused quartz:
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{air}} \sin(55.0°) = n_{\text{quartz}} \sin \theta_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{\sin(55.0°)}{1.456} = \frac{0.8192}{1.456} = 0.5626$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = 34.2°$$
</div>

Now for 470 nm (blue) light in flint glass with the same refraction angle:
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{air}} \sin \theta_1 = n_{\text{flint}} \sin(34.2°)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = 1.684 \times \sin(34.2°) = 1.684 \times 0.5626 = 0.9474$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \sin^{-1}(0.9474) = 71.3°$$
</div>

**Answer:** The 470 nm light must enter flint glass at **71.3°** to have the same angle of refraction.

**Discussion**

The significantly larger incident angle (71.3° vs. 55.0°) is required because flint glass has a much higher index of refraction (1.684) than fused quartz (1.456). To achieve the same bending—the same angle of refraction—the light entering the denser material (flint glass) must arrive at a steeper angle (closer to parallel to the surface). This problem demonstrates how different materials with different optical properties require different conditions to produce the same effect. Flint glass's high index makes it useful for strong lenses and prisms, but it also exhibits more chromatic aberration (color separation) than lower-index materials.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a parallel-sided plate, light emerges parallel to its incident direction but laterally displaced. We need to find the displacement for each color, which differs due to dispersion. From [[Table 1]](#Table1): $$n_{\text{red}} = 1.512$$ and $$n_{\text{blue}} = 1.524$$ for crown glass.

**Solution**

**(a)** For a parallel-sided glass plate, the emerging ray is parallel to the incident ray. Therefore, both colors emerge at **30.0°** (the same angle as incidence).

**(b)** First, find the refraction angle in the glass for each color.

For red light:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{red}} = \frac{\sin(30.0°)}{1.512} = \frac{0.500}{1.512} = 0.3307$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{red}} = 19.3°$$
</div>

For blue light:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{blue}} = \frac{0.500}{1.524} = 0.3281$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{blue}} = 19.2°$$
</div>

The lateral displacement for each color is:
<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{t \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}{\cos \theta_2}$$
</div>

For red:
<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{red}} = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm} \times \sin(30.0° - 19.3°)}{\cos(19.3°)} = \frac{1.00 \times \sin(10.7°)}{\cos(19.3°)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{red}} = \frac{1.00 \times 0.1857}{0.9434} = 0.197 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

For blue:
<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{blue}} = \frac{1.00 \times \sin(30.0° - 19.2°)}{\cos(19.2°)} = \frac{1.00 \times \sin(10.8°)}{\cos(19.2°)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{blue}} = \frac{1.00 \times 0.1874}{0.9441} = 0.198 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

Separation:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta d = 0.198 - 0.197 = 0.001 \text{ cm} = 0.01 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**Answer:** (a) Both colors emerge at **30.0°**. (b) They are separated by approximately **0.01 mm** or **10 micrometers**.

**Discussion**

Although both colors emerge parallel to their original direction, they are laterally displaced by slightly different amounts due to dispersion. The separation is very small (only 10 μm for 1 cm of glass) because crown glass has relatively low dispersion. This demonstrates why windowpanes don't noticeably separate colors—the dispersion and thickness are too small to create visible color fringing in normal viewing.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A narrow beam of white light enters a prism made of crown glass at a  $$ 45.0º $$

{: #Figure6}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Apply Snell's law twice: once at entry and once at exit. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), for crown glass: $$n_{\text{red}} = 1.512$$ and $$n_{\text{violet}} = 1.530$$. The prism is equilateral (60° apex angle).

**Solution**

**First surface (entry):**

For red light:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{red}} = \frac{\sin(45.0°)}{1.512} = \frac{0.7071}{1.512} = 0.4676$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{red}} = 27.88°$$
</div>

For violet light:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{2,\text{violet}} = \frac{0.7071}{1.530} = 0.4622$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{2,\text{violet}} = 27.52°$$
</div>

**Second surface (exit):**

For an equilateral prism, the angle at which the refracted ray hits the second surface is $$\theta_3 = 60° - \theta_2$$.

For red: $$\theta_{3,\text{red}} = 60° - 27.88° = 32.12°$$

For violet: $$\theta_{3,\text{violet}} = 60° - 27.52° = 32.48°$$

Apply Snell's law at exit:

For red:
<div class="equation">
$$n_{\text{red}} \sin(32.12°) = \sin \theta_{\text{R}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{R}} = 1.512 \times 0.5317 = 0.8040$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{R}} = 53.5°$$
</div>

For violet:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{V}} = 1.530 \times \sin(32.48°) = 1.530 \times 0.5372 = 0.8219$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{V}} = 55.3°$$
</div>

**Answer:** Red light emerges at **53.5°** and violet light emerges at **55.3°** (or **55.2°** with rounding).

**Discussion**

The 1.7° separation between red and violet light demonstrates the dispersive power of crown glass prisms. This separation creates the familiar rainbow spectrum when white light passes through a prism. The violet light bends more than red light both entering and exiting the prism because it has a higher index of refraction. Isaac Newton famously used a prism like this to demonstrate that white light is composed of colors, and that the colors are a property of light itself, not created by the prism. Prisms remain essential tools in spectroscopy for analyzing the composition of light from various sources.
