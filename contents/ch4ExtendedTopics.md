* Understand the four basic forces that underlie the processes in nature.

</div>

One of the most remarkable simplifications in physics is that only four distinct
forces account for all known phenomena. In fact, nearly all of the forces we
experience directly are due to only one basic force, called the electromagnetic
force. (The gravitational force is the only force we experience directly that is
not electromagnetic.) This is a tremendous simplification of the myriad of
*apparently* different forces we can list, only a few of which were discussed in
the previous section. As we will see, the basic forces are all thought to act
through the exchange of microscopic carrier particles, and the characteristics
of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles exchanged. Action
at a distance, such as the gravitational force of Earth on the Moon, is
explained by the existence of a **force field** rather than by “physical
contact.”

The *four basic forces* are the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force,
the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Their properties are
summarized in [Table 1](#Table1). Since the weak and strong nuclear forces act
over an extremely short range, the size of a nucleus or less, we do not
experience them directly, although they are crucial to the very structure of
matter. These forces determine which nuclei are stable and which decay, and they
are the basis of the release of energy in certain nuclear reactions. Nuclear
forces determine not only the stability of nuclei, but also the relative
abundance of elements in nature. The properties of the nucleus of an atom
determine the number of electrons it has and, thus, indirectly determine the
chemistry of the atom. More will be said of all of these topics in later
chapters.

Concept Connections: The Four Basic Forces
</div>
The four basic forces will be encountered in more detail as you progress in you study.
The gravitational force is defined in [Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation](../contents/ch6UniformCircularMotionAndGravitation.md).
On a macroscopic scale, electromagnetism and gravity are the basis for all forces.
The nuclear forces are vital to the substructure of matter, but they are not directly
experienced on the macroscopic scale.

##### Table 1: Properties of the Four Basic Forces

| Force           | Approximate Relative Strengths | Range          | Attraction/Repulsion     | Carrier Particle |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Gravitational   | $$ 10^{−38}$$                  | $$\infty$$     | attractive only          | Graviton         |
| Electromagnetic | $$10^{-2}$$                    | $$\infty$$     | attractive and repulsive | Photon           |
| Weak nuclear    | $$10^{-6}$$                    | $$<10^{-18}$$m | attractive and repulsive | W+, W–, Z0       |
| Strong nuclear  | $$1$$                          | $$<10^{-15}$$m | attractive and repulsive | Gluons           |

{ #Table1}

The gravitational force is surprisingly weak—it is only because gravity is
always attractive that we notice it at all. Our weight is the gravitational
force due to the *entire* Earth acting on us. On the very large scale, as in
astronomical systems, the gravitational force is the dominant force determining
the motions of moons, planets, stars, and galaxies. The gravitational force also
affects the nature of space and time. As we shall see later in the study of
general relativity, space is curved in the vicinity of very massive bodies, such
as the Sun, and time actually slows down near massive bodies.

Electromagnetic forces can be either attractive or repulsive. They are
long-range forces, which act over extremely large distances, and they nearly
cancel for macroscopic objects. (Remember that it is the *net* external force
that is important.) If they did not cancel, electromagnetic forces would
completely overwhelm the gravitational force. The electromagnetic force is a
combination of electrical forces (such as those that cause static electricity)
and magnetic forces (such as those that affect a compass needle). These two
forces were thought to be quite distinct until early in the 19th century, when
scientists began to discover that they are different manifestations of the same
force. This discovery is a classical case of the *unification of forces*.
Similarly, friction, tension, and all of the other classes of forces we
experience directly (except gravity, of course) are due to electromagnetic
interactions of atoms and molecules. It is still convenient to consider these
forces separately in specific applications, however, because of the ways they
manifest themselves.

<div class="title">
Concept Connections: Unifying Forces
</div>
Attempts to unify the four basic forces are discussed in relation to elementary particles later
in this text. By “unify” we mean finding connections between the forces that show that they are
different manifestations of a single force. Even if such unification is achieved, the forces will
retain their separate characteristics on the macroscopic scale and may be identical only under
extreme conditions such as those existing in the early universe.

</div>

Physicists are now exploring whether the four basic forces are in some way
related. Attempts to unify all forces into one come under the rubric of Grand
Unified Theories (GUTs), with which there has been some success in recent years.
It is now known that under conditions of extremely high density and temperature,
such as existed in the early universe, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear
forces are indistinguishable. They can now be considered to be different
manifestations of one force, called the *electroweak* force. So the list of four
has been reduced in a sense to only three. Further progress in unifying all
forces is proving difficult—especially the inclusion of the gravitational force,
which has the special characteristics of affecting the space and time in which
the other forces exist.

While the unification of forces will not affect how we discuss forces in this
text, it is fascinating that such underlying simplicity exists in the face of
the overt complexity of the universe. There is no reason that nature must be
simple—it simply is.

### Action at a Distance: Concept of a Field

All forces act at a distance. This is obvious for the gravitational force. Earth
and the Moon, for example, interact without coming into contact. It is also true
for all other forces. Friction, for example, is an electromagnetic force between
atoms that may not actually touch. What is it that carries forces between
objects? One way to answer this question is to imagine that a **force field**
surrounds whatever object creates the force. A second object (often called a 
*test object*) placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of
location and other variables. The field itself is the “thing” that carries the
force from one object to another. The field is defined so as to be a
characteristic of the object creating it; the field does not depend on the test
object placed in it. Earth’s gravitational field, for example, is a function of
the mass of Earth and the distance from its center, independent of the presence
of other masses. The concept of a field is useful because equations can be
written for force fields surrounding objects (
for gravity, this yields $$ w=mg $$ at Earth’s surface), and motions can be
calculated from these equations. (
See [Figure 1](#Figure1).)

Electric field lines start from the positive charge and end at the negative charge, and each line is represented as a curved arrow.](../resources/Figure_04_08_01.jpg "The electric force field between a positively charged particle and a negatively charged particle. When a positive test charge is placed in the field, the charge will experience a force in the direction of the force field lines.")

Concept Connections: Force Fields
</div>
The concept of a **force field** is also used in connection with electric charge. It is also a
useful idea for all the basic forces. Fields help us to visualize forces and how they
are transmitted, as well as to describe them with precision and to link forces with subatomic carrier particles.
</div>

The field concept has been applied very successfully; we can calculate motions
and describe nature to high precision using field equations. As useful as the
field concept is, however, it leaves unanswered the question of what carries the
force. It has been proposed in recent decades, starting in 1935 with Hideki
Yukawa’s (1907–1981) work on the strong nuclear force, that all forces are
transmitted by the exchange of elementary particles. We can visualize particle
exchange as analogous to macroscopic phenomena such as two people passing a
basketball back and forth, thereby exerting a repulsive force without touching
one another. (See [Figure 2](#Figure2).)

![(a) Two persons throwing a basketball to each other. The person on the left is throwing the ball with some force F sub p one, represented by a vector pointing right, in the direction of the motion of the ball. A reaction force F sub B is shown on the person by a vector pointing left. (b) The person catches the ball, exerting a force F sub p two on the ball toward the left, shown by a vector F sub p two toward the left. A reaction force F prime sub B acts on the person, shown by a vector pointing toward right.
(c) The exchange of a meson is shown between a proton and a neutron. Both are moving in different directions, and the proton feels a force F sub exch toward the left and the neutron feels a force F prime sub exch toward the right. The meson is also moving toward the right between the proton and the neutron.](../resources/Figure_04_08_02.jpg "The exchange of masses resulting in repulsive forces. (a) The person throwing the basketball exerts a force \( \vb{F}_{p1} \) on it toward the other person and feels a reaction force &#10; \( \vb{F}_B \) away from the second person. (b) The person catching the basketball exerts a force &#10;\( \vb{F}_{p2} \) on it to stop the ball and feels a reaction force &#10; \( \vb{F}^\prime_B \) away from the first person.
(c) The analogous exchange of a meson between a proton and a neutron carries the strong nuclear forces \( \vb{F}_\text{exch} \) and \( \vb{F}^\prime_\text{exch} \) between them. An attractive force can also be exerted by the exchange of a mass&#x2014;if person 2 pulled the basketball away from the first person as he tried to retain it, then the force between them would be attractive.")
{ #Figure2 height="450"}

This idea of particle exchange deepens rather than contradicts field concepts.
It is more satisfying philosophically to think of something physical actually
moving between objects acting at a distance. [Table 1](#Table1)
lists the exchange or **carrier particles**, both observed and proposed, that
carry the four forces. But the real fruit of the particle-exchange proposal is
that searches for Yukawa’s proposed particle found it *and* a number of others
that were completely unexpected, stimulating yet more research. All of this
research eventually led to the proposal of quarks as the underlying substructure
of matter, which is a basic tenet of GUTs. If successful, these theories will
explain not only forces, but also the structure of matter itself. Yet physics is
an experimental science, so the test of these theories must lie in the domain of
the real world. As of this writing, scientists at the CERN laboratory in
Switzerland are starting to test these theories using the world’s largest
particle accelerator: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) . This accelerator (27 km in
circumference) allows two high-energy proton beams, traveling in opposite
directions, to collide. An energy of 14 trillion electron volts will be
available. Its first run discoveries included the force carrier
particles, namely the Higgs boson. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).) 
The LHC's goal is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson, searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories, and other unresolved questions in particle physics such as why different particles have different masses.

Two beams, traveling in opposite directions close to the speed of light, collide in a tube similar to the central tube shown here. External magnets determine the beam&#x2019;s path. Special detectors will analyze particles created in these collisions. Questions as broad as what is the origin of mass and what was matter like the first few seconds of our universe will be explored. This accelerator began preliminary operation in 2008. (credit: Frank Hommes)")

Tiny particles also have wave-like behavior, something we will explore more in a
later chapter. To better understand force-carrier particles from another
perspective, let us consider gravity. The search for gravitational waves has
been going on for a number of years. Almost 100 years ago, Einstein predicted
the existence of these waves as part of his general theory of relativity.
Gravitational waves are created during the collision of massive stars, in black
holes, or in supernova explosions—like shock waves. These gravitational waves
will travel through space from such sites much like a pebble dropped into a pond
sends out ripples—except these waves move at the speed of light. A detector
apparatus has been built in the U.S., consisting of two large installations
nearly 3000 km apart—one in Washington state and one in Louisiana! The facility
is called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Each
installation is designed to use optical lasers to examine any slight shift in
the relative positions of two masses due to the effect of gravity waves. The two
sites allow simultaneous measurements of these small effects to be separated
from other natural phenomena, such as earthquakes.
Similar installations have been built in Italy (VIRGO), Germany (GEO600), and
Japan (TAMA300) to provide a worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors.

In September, 2015, LIGO fulfilled its promise and helped prove Einstein's predictions. The system detected the first gravitational waves arising from the merger of two black holes—one 29 times the mass of our Sun and the other 36 times the mass of our Sun—that occurred 1.3 billion years ago. About 3 times the mass of the Sun was converted into gravitational waves in a fraction of a second—with a peak power output about 50 times that of the whole visible universe. Due to the 7 millisecond delay in detection, researchers established that the merger occurred on the southern hemisphere side of Earth. Since then, LIGO and VIRGO have combined to detect about a dozen similar events, with better and more precise measurements. Waves from neutron star mergers and different-sized black holes have deepened our understanding of these objects and their impact on the universe.

International collaboration in this area is moving into space with the joint
EU/US project LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). Earthquakes and other
Earthly noises will be no problem for these monitoring spacecraft. LISA will
complement LIGO by looking at much more massive black holes through the
observation of gravitational-wave sources emitting much larger wavelengths.
Three satellites will be placed in space above Earth in an equilateral
triangle (with 5 000 000-km sides) ([Figure 4](#Figure4)). The system will measure
the relative positions of each satellite to detect passing gravitational waves.
Accuracy to within 10% of the size of an atom will be needed to detect any
waves. The launch of this project will likely be in the 2030s.

Each satellite of LISA will consist of a laser source and a mass. The lasers will transmit a signal to measure the distance between each satellite&#x2019;s test mass. The relative motion of these masses will provide information about passing gravitational waves. (credit: NASA)")
{ #Figure4}

As you can see above, some of the most groundbreaking developments in physics are made with a relatively long gap from theoretical prediction to experimental detection. This pattern continues the process of science from its earliest days, where early thinkers and researchers made discoveries that only led to more questions. Einstein was unique in many ways, but he was not unique in that later scientists, building on his and each other's work, would prove his theories. Evidence for black holes became more and more concrete as scientists developed new and better ways to look for them. Some of the most prominent have been Roger Penrose, who developed new mathematical models related to black holes, as well as Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez, who independently used telescope observations to identify a region of our galaxy where a massive unseen gravity source (4 million times the size of our Sun) was pulling on stars. And soon after, collaborators on the Event Horizon Telescope project produced the first actual image of a black hole.

The ideas presented in this section are but a glimpse into topics of modern
physics that will be covered in much greater depth in later chapters.

### Summary

* The various types of forces that are categorized for use in many applications
  are all manifestations of the *four basic forces*
  in nature.
* The properties of these forces are summarized in [Table 1](#Table1).
* Everything we experience directly without sensitive instruments is due to
  either electromagnetic forces or gravitational forces. The nuclear forces are
  responsible for the submicroscopic structure of matter, but they are not
  directly sensed because of their short ranges. Attempts are being made to show
  all four forces are different manifestations of a single unified force.
* A force field surrounds an object creating a force and is the carrier of that
  force.

Based on this ratio, you might expect that the strong force dominates the nucleus, which is true for small nuclei. Large nuclei, however, have sizes greater than the range of the strong nuclear force. At these sizes, the electromagnetic force begins to affect nuclear stability.
