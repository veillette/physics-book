</div>

It is one thing to have a system in equilibrium; it is quite another for it to
be stable. The toy doll perched on the man’s hand in [Figure 1](#Figure1), for
example, is not in stable equilibrium. There are _three types of
equilibrium_ : _stable_, _unstable_, and _neutral_. Figures throughout this
module illustrate various examples.

[Figure 1](#Figure1) presents a balanced system, such as the toy doll on the man’s
hand, which has its center of gravity (cg) directly over the pivot, so that the
torque of the total weight is zero. This is equivalent to having the torques of
the individual parts balanced about the pivot point, in this case the hand. The
cgs of the arms, legs, head, and torso are labeled with smaller type.

![In the figure a man is shown balancing a child on his hand. The child is enjoying the activity.](../resources/Figure_09_03_01.jpg 'A man balances a toy doll on one hand.')
{: #Figure1}

A system is said to be in **stable equilibrium** if, when displaced from
equilibrium, it experiences a net force or torque in a direction opposite to the
direction of the displacement. For example, a marble at the bottom of a bowl
will experience a
_restoring_ force when displaced from its equilibrium position. This force moves
it back toward the equilibrium position. Most systems are in stable equilibrium,
especially for small displacements. For another example of stable equilibrium,
see the pencil in [Figure 2](#Figure2)
.

![A pencil is balanced vertically on its flat end. The weight W of the pencil is acting at its center of gravity downward. The normal reaction N of the surface is shown as an arrow upward. A free body diagram is shown at right of the pencil. The midpoint of the flat base of the pencil is marked as pivot point.](../resources/Figure_09_03_02.jpg 'This pencil is in the condition of equilibrium. The net force on the pencil is zero and the total torque about any pivot is zero. ')
{: #Figure2}

A system is in **unstable equilibrium** if, when displaced, it experiences a net
force or torque in the _same_ direction as the displacement from equilibrium. A
system in unstable equilibrium accelerates away from its equilibrium position if
displaced even slightly. An obvious example is a ball resting on top of a hill.
Once displaced, it accelerates away from the crest. See the next several figures
for examples of unstable equilibrium.

![A pencil is tilted slightly toward left. The left end point of its flat surface is marked as the pivot point. The weight W of the pencil is acting at the center of gravity of the pencil. The normal reaction N of the pencil is acting upward at the pivot point. The line of action of the normal reaction is toward left of the line of action of the weight of the pencil.](../resources/Figure_09_03_03.jpg 'If the pencil is displaced slightly to the side (counterclockwise), it is no longer in equilibrium. Its weight produces a clockwise torque that returns the pencil to its equilibrium position.')
{: #Figure3}

![A pencil is tilted toward left so that the line of action of its weight is toward left of the pivot point which is the left end of the flat end of the pencil.](../resources/Figure_09_03_04.jpg 'If the pencil is displaced too far, the torque caused by its weight changes direction to counterclockwise and causes the displacement to increase.')
{: #Figure4}

![A vertical pencil balanced at its sharp end is shown. The weight of the pencil is acting at its center of gravity and is in the line with the normal reaction N at the pivot point of the pencil.](../resources/Figure_09_03_05.jpg 'This figure shows unstable equilibrium, although both conditions for equilibrium are satisfied.')
{: #Figure5}

![A vertical pencil tilted toward left is shown. The sharp end of the pencil is down and labeled as pivot point. The weight of the pencil is acting at its center of gravity and the line of action of the weight is toward left of the pivot point.](../resources/Figure_09_03_06.jpg 'If the pencil is displaced even slightly, a torque is created by its weight that is in the same direction as the displacement, causing the displacement to increase.')
{: #Figure6}

A system is in **neutral equilibrium** if its equilibrium is independent of
displacements from its original position. A marble on a flat horizontal surface
is an example. Combinations of these situations are possible. For example, a
marble on a saddle is stable for displacements toward the front or back of the
saddle and unstable for displacements to the side. [Figure 7](#Figure7) shows
another example of neutral equilibrium.

![In figure a, a ball is lying on a flat surface and the point of contact with the surface is labeled pivot point. The weight of the ball is acting at the center of gravity of the ball. The normal force N is in the same line as the weight of the ball. The torque on the ball is zero. In figure b, a side view of a pencil lying flat on a table is shown. The sharp end of the pencil is toward right. The weight of the pencil is acting at the center of gravity of the pencil. The normal reaction N of the table surface is in the same line of action as the weight but in the upward direction.](../resources/Figure_09_03_07.jpg '(a) Here we see neutral equilibrium. The cg of a sphere on a flat surface lies directly above the point of support, independent of the position on the surface. The sphere is therefore in equilibrium in any location, and if displaced, it will remain put. (b) Because it has a circular cross section, the pencil is in neutral equilibrium for displacements perpendicular to its length.')
{: #Figure7}

When we consider how far a system in stable equilibrium can be displaced before
it becomes unstable, we find that some systems in stable equilibrium are more
stable than others. The pencil in [Figure 2](#Figure2) and the person
in [Figure 8](#Figure8)(a) are in stable equilibrium, but become unstable for
relatively small displacements to the side. The critical point is reached when
the cg is no longer _above_ the base of support. Additionally, since the cg of a
person’s body is above the pivots in the hips, displacements must be quickly
controlled. This control is a central nervous system function that is developed
when we learn to hold our bodies erect as infants. For increased stability while
standing, the feet should be spread apart, giving a larger base of support.
Stability is also increased by lowering one’s center of gravity by bending the
knees, as when a football player prepares to receive a ball or braces themselves
for a tackle. A cane, a crutch, or a walker increases the stability of the user,
even more as the base of support widens. Usually, the cg of a female is lower (
closer to the ground) than a male. Young children have their center of gravity
between their shoulders, which increases the challenge of learning to walk.

![Part a of the figure shows a man standing on the ground. The feet are a shoulder-width apart from each other. The weight W of the man is acting at the center of gravity of the body of the man. Two normal reactions N each are shown acting on the feet of the man. The distance between the feet of the man is marked as the base of support. A free body diagram is also shown on the left side of the figure. Part b of the figure shows a man standing upright with his knees bent. The feet are a distance apart from each other. The weight W of the man is acting at the center of gravity of the body of the man. Two normal reactions N each are shown acting on the feet of the man. The distance between the feet of the man is marked as the base of support.](../resources/Figure_09_03_08.jpg '(a) The  center of gravity of an adult is above the hip joints (one of the main pivots in the body) and lies between two narrowly-separated feet. Like a pencil standing on its eraser, this person is in stable equilibrium in relation to sideways displacements, but relatively small displacements take his cg outside the base of support and make him unstable. Humans are less stable relative to forward and backward displacements because the feet are not very long. Muscles are used extensively to balance the body in the front-to-back direction. (b) While bending in the manner shown, stability is increased by lowering the center of gravity. Stability is also increased if the base is expanded by placing the feet farther apart.')
{: #Figure8}

Animals such as chickens have easier systems to control. [Figure 9](#Figure9) shows
that the cg of a chicken lies below its hip joints and between its widely
separated and broad feet. Even relatively large displacements of the chicken’s
cg are stable and result in restoring forces and torques that return the cg to
its equilibrium position with little effort on the chicken’s part. Not all birds
are like chickens, of course. Some birds, such as the flamingo, have balance
systems that are almost as sophisticated as that of humans.

[Figure 9](#Figure9) shows that the cg of a chicken is below the hip joints and
lies above a broad base of support formed by widely-separated and large feet.
Hence, the chicken is in very stable equilibrium, since a relatively large
displacement is needed to render it unstable. The body of the chicken is
supported from above by the hips and acts as a pendulum between the hips.
Therefore, the chicken is stable for front-to-back displacements as well as for
side-to-side displacements.

Engineers and architects strive to achieve extremely stable equilibriums for
buildings and other systems that must withstand wind, earthquakes, and other
forces that displace them from equilibrium. Although the examples in this
section emphasize gravitational forces, the basic conditions for equilibrium are
the same for all types of forces. The net external force must be zero, and the
net torque must also be zero.

### Section Summary

- A system is said to be in stable equilibrium if, when displaced from
  equilibrium, it experiences a net force or torque in a direction opposite the
  direction of the displacement.
- A system is in unstable equilibrium if, when displaced from equilibrium, it
  experiences a net force or torque in the same direction as the displacement
  from equilibrium.
- A system is in neutral equilibrium if its equilibrium is independent of
  displacements from its original position.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A round pencil lying on its side as in [Figure 4](#Figure4) is in neutral equilibrium relative to displacements perpendicular to its length. What is its stability relative to displacements parallel to its length?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze what happens to the pencil's center of gravity when it is displaced parallel to its length, and determine whether the resulting torque (if any) would restore it to its original position, move it further away, or have no effect.

**Solution**

A round pencil lying on a flat horizontal surface is also in **neutral equilibrium** for displacements parallel to its length.

Here's why:

- When the pencil is pushed along its length (parallel to its axis), the center of gravity (cg) moves horizontally but remains at the same height above the surface.
- The pencil remains in contact with the surface, and the normal force continues to act directly below the cg.
- Since the cg doesn't rise or fall, there is no gravitational potential energy change.
- There is no restoring force or torque that would return the pencil to its original position.
- There is also no force or torque that would push it further from its original position.

The pencil simply stays wherever it is placed, which is the definition of neutral equilibrium.

**Discussion**

This analysis reveals that the pencil is in neutral equilibrium for any displacement along the flat surface—whether perpendicular or parallel to its length. This makes sense because the flat surface and round cross-section create a situation where the cg height is independent of position. Compare this to a marble on a flat surface, which is similarly in neutral equilibrium in all horizontal directions.

Explain the need for tall towers on a suspension bridge to ensure stable equilibrium.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze how the height of the towers affects the stability of the bridge by considering the geometry of the suspension cables and how forces are distributed to counteract disturbances.

**Solution**

Tall towers on a suspension bridge are necessary to ensure stable equilibrium for several interconnected reasons:

1. **Lowering the center of gravity of the roadway:** The roadway deck hangs below the main cables. Taller towers allow the cables to drape higher, positioning the heavy roadway relatively lower. A lower center of gravity provides greater stability against tipping or swaying.

2. **Creating restoring forces:** When the bridge deck is displaced laterally by wind or other forces, the geometry of the cable system creates restoring forces. The cables pull the deck back toward its equilibrium position. Taller towers create more vertical cable segments, which provide stronger horizontal restoring forces when displaced.

3. **Distributing weight effectively:** The cables transfer the weight of the deck to the towers at a steep angle. Taller towers create more vertical cable angles, reducing horizontal forces on the towers and creating a more stable force distribution.

4. **Geometric stability:** The inverted "V" or "A" shape created by the cables from the tall towers to the deck creates a wide base of support for the suspended structure. This is similar to how a person standing with feet apart is more stable than one with feet together.

**Discussion**

This principle is analogous to lowering the center of gravity in other stable systems. Just as a chicken with its cg below its hips is more stable than a human with cg above the hips, a suspension bridge with the roadway suspended well below tall towers is more stable than one with shorter towers. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 highlighted the importance of proper design for stability against wind-induced oscillations, leading to modern bridge designs that emphasize both vertical and torsional stability.

Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in [Figure 10](#Figure10). Calculate the force exerted on the wall assuming that force is horizontal while using the data in the schematic representation of the situation. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. The total mass of the horse and rider is 500 kg. Take the data to be accurate to three digits.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Two children of mass 20.0 kg and 30.0 kg sit balanced on a seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw. If the children are separated by a distance of 3.00 m, at what distance from the pivot point is the small child sitting in order to maintain the balance?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For the seesaw to be balanced, the net torque about the pivot must be zero. We use the second condition for equilibrium: $$ \text{net}\tau = 0 $$. Let $$ r_1 $$ be the distance of the smaller child from the pivot and $$ r_2 $$ be the distance of the larger child. We know that $$ r_1 + r_2 = 3.00 \m $$.

**Solution**

Let:

- $$ m_1 = 20.0 \kg $$ (smaller child)
- $$ m_2 = 30.0 \kg $$ (larger child)
- $$ r_1 $$ = distance of smaller child from pivot
- $$ r_2 $$ = distance of larger child from pivot
- $$ r_1 + r_2 = 3.00 \m $$

For balance, the torques must be equal in magnitude:

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_1 = \tau_2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ m_1 g r_1 = m_2 g r_2 $$
</div>

The gravitational acceleration cancels:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ (20.0 \kg) r_1 = (30.0 \kg) r_2 $$
</div>

From the constraint $$ r_1 + r_2 = 3.00 \m $$, we get $$ r_2 = 3.00 \m - r_1 $$.

Substituting:

<div class="equation">
$$ (20.0 \kg) r_1 = (30.0 \kg)(3.00 \m - r_1) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 20.0 r_1 = 90.0 - 30.0 r_1 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 50.0 r_1 = 90.0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ r_1 = \frac{90.0}{50.0} = 1.80 \m $$
</div>

The smaller child sits **1.80 m** from the pivot point.

**Discussion**

As expected, the lighter child must sit farther from the pivot to balance the heavier child. The ratio of distances is inversely proportional to the ratio of masses: $$ r_1/r_2 = m_2/m_1 = 30.0/20.0 = 1.5 $$. We can verify: $$ r_2 = 3.00 - 1.80 = 1.20 \m $$, and indeed $$ 1.80/1.20 = 1.5 $$. This is the same principle used in balance scales and lever systems.

A person carries a plank of wood 2.00 m long with one hand pushing down on it at one end
with a force $$ \vb{F}_1 $$ and the other hand holding it up at 0.500 m from the end of the plank with force
$$ \vb{F}_2 $$. If the plank has a mass of 20.0 kg and its center of gravity is at the middle
of the plank, what are the magnitudes of the forces $$ \vb{F}_{1} $$
and $$ \vb{F}_{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply both conditions for equilibrium. The first condition (net force = 0) relates the forces, and the second condition (net torque = 0) allows us to solve for one of the unknown forces. We choose the pivot point at the location of one hand to eliminate one unknown from the torque equation.

**Solution**

Given:

- Plank length: $$ L = 2.00 \m $$
- Plank mass: $$ m = 20.0 \kg $$
- Weight: $$ W = mg = (20.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 196 \N $$
- Center of gravity: at the middle of the plank, 1.00 m from each end
- $$ F_1 $$ is applied at one end (at position 0 m), pushing down
- $$ F_2 $$ is applied at 0.500 m from the end, pushing up
- Distance from $$ F_1 $$ to cg: 1.00 m
- Distance from $$ F_2 $$ to cg: 1.00 - 0.500 = 0.500 m

**Finding $$ F_2 $$ using torque equilibrium:**

Choose the pivot at the location of $$ F_1 $$ (the end of the plank). Then $$ F_1 $$ produces no torque.

The torque due to the weight (at 1.00 m from the pivot) is clockwise (negative):
$$ \tau_W = -W \times 1.00 \m = -(196 \N)(1.00 \m) = -196 \text{ N·m} $$

The torque due to $$ F*2 $$ (at 0.500 m from the pivot) is counterclockwise (positive):
$$ \tau*{F_2} = F_2 \times 0.500 \m $$

For equilibrium: $$ \text{net}\tau = 0 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ F_2 \times 0.500 \m - 196 \text{ N·m} = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_2 = \frac{196 \text{ N·m}}{0.500 \m} = 392 \N $$
</div>

**Finding $$ F_1 $$ using force equilibrium:**

Taking up as positive and down as negative:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{net}F = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_2 - F_1 - W = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_1 = F_2 - W = 392 \N - 196 \N = 196 \N $$
</div>

The magnitudes are: $$ F_1 = 196 \N $$ (pushing down) and $$ F_2 = 392 \N $$ (pushing up).

**Discussion**

Notice that $$ F_2 $$ is greater than the weight of the plank! This is because $$ F_2 $$ must not only support the weight but also counteract the downward push of $$ F_1 $$. The hand at position 2 acts as a fulcrum, and the system behaves like a lever. The fact that $$ F_2 = 2W $$ makes sense given the geometry: the cg is twice as far from $$ F_2 $$ as it is from where $$ F_2 $$ is applied. This carrying technique is common for long boards, but it requires significant force from the supporting hand.

The weight of the chicken w is acting at the center of gravity.](../resources/Figure_09_03_12.jpg ' ')
{: #Figure12}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For the chicken to be in equilibrium while displaced, the torques about the pivot point (the foot) must sum to zero. The weight creates a torque about the foot, and the wind force must create an equal and opposite torque. From the figure, the center of gravity is 9.0 cm horizontally from the foot and 20 cm above the ground.

**Solution for (a)**

Given:

- Mass: $$ m = 2.50 \kg $$
- Weight: $$ W = mg = (2.50 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 24.5 \N $$
- Horizontal distance from foot to cg: $$ d_x = 9.0 \text{ cm} = 0.090 \m $$
- Height of cg: $$ h = 20 \text{ cm} = 0.20 \m $$

Taking torques about the pivot point (the foot):

- The weight creates a clockwise torque: $$ \tau_W = W \times d_x $$
- The wind force creates a counterclockwise torque: $$ \tau*{\text{wind}} = F*{\text{wind}} \times h $$

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_{\text{wind}} = \tau_W $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{wind}} \times h = W \times d_x $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{wind}} = \frac{W \times d_x}{h} = \frac{(24.5 \N)(0.090 \m)}{0.20 \m} = 11.0 \N $$
</div>

The wind must exert a force of **11.0 N** on the chicken.

**Solution for (b)**

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F_{\text{wind}}}{W} = \frac{11.0 \N}{24.5 \N} = 0.45 $$
</div>

The ratio of wind force to weight is **0.45**, or about 45%.

**Solution for (c)**

Yes, this supports the contention that the chicken has a relatively stable construction. Even when displaced significantly from equilibrium (with the cg 9.0 cm away from the foot), only a moderate wind force—less than half the chicken's weight—is needed to maintain balance.

This is because the chicken's cg is relatively low (only 20 cm above the ground), creating a short lever arm for the wind force, while the horizontal displacement creates a modest restoring torque from gravity. If the chicken's cg were higher (like a human's), a much smaller wind force relative to weight would cause tipping.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates why chickens are remarkably stable birds. Their low center of gravity and wide stance create a geometry where large displacements require proportionally larger disturbing forces. Compare this to a human, whose high cg means that even small displacements can lead to falling. This stable construction allows chickens to maintain balance easily while pecking at the ground or when buffeted by wind.

- Car position: at $$ L/4 $$ from hinges (halfway between hinges and cable attachment, which means halfway along the half-length to the cables = L/4 from hinges... but the problem states "halfway between hinges and cable attachments" which means at $$ L/2 $$)

Let me reconsider: "halfway between the hinges and the cable attachments" means at the midpoint of the bridge, which is at $$ L/2 $$ from the hinges—the same location as the bridge's center of gravity.

Taking torques about the hinge (to eliminate the hinge force):

The weight of the bridge acts at $$ L/2 $$:
$$ \tau\_{b} = -m_b g (L/2) $$

The weight of the car acts at $$ L/2 $$:
$$ \tau\_{c} = -m_c g (L/2) $$

The vertical component of the cable tension acts at $$ L $$:
$$ \tau\_{T} = T\sin{40°} \cdot L $$

For equilibrium: $$ \text{net}\tau = 0 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ T\sin{40°} \cdot L = m_b g (L/2) + m_c g (L/2) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T\sin{40°} = \frac{(m_b + m_c) g}{2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{(m_b + m_c) g}{2\sin{40°}} = \frac{(2500 \kg + 900 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{2(0.643)} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{(3400 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{1.286} = \frac{33320 \N}{1.286} = 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

The force in the cables is **$$ 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N $$** or about **25.9 kN**.

**Solution for (b)**

For the first condition of equilibrium, we analyze forces in both x and y directions.

Horizontal (x) direction:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hx} - T\cos{40°} = 0 $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hx} = T\cos{40°} = (2.59 \times 10^{4} \N)(0.766) = 1.98 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Vertical (y) direction:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hy} + T\sin{40°} - (m_b + m_c)g = 0 $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hy} = (m_b + m_c)g - T\sin{40°} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hy} = (3400 \kg)(9.80 \mss) - (2.59 \times 10^{4} \N)(0.643) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{hy} = 33320 \N - 16650 \N = 1.67 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Magnitude of hinge force:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_h = \sqrt{F_{hx}^2 + F_{hy}^2} = \sqrt{(1.98 \times 10^{4})^2 + (1.67 \times 10^{4})^2} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_h = \sqrt{3.92 \times 10^{8} + 2.79 \times 10^{8}} = \sqrt{6.71 \times 10^{8}} = 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Direction:

<div class="equation">
$$ \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{F_{hy}}{F_{hx}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{1.67 \times 10^{4}}{1.98 \times 10^{4}}\right) = \arctan(0.843) = 40.2° $$
</div>

The hinge exerts a force of **$$ 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N $$** at **40° above horizontal** (pointing toward the cables).

**Discussion**

The cable tension increased from the case without the car. The hinge force has both horizontal and vertical components because the cables pull at an angle. The horizontal component of the hinge force exactly balances the horizontal pull from the cables, while the vertical component helps support some of the weight along with the cables' vertical component.

(a) What minimum coefficient of friction is needed between the legs and the ground to keep the sign in [Figure 14](#Figure14) in the position shown if the chain breaks?
(b) What force is exerted by each side on the hinge?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

If the chain breaks, the only horizontal force preventing the legs from sliding apart is friction at the ground. Each half of the sign is in equilibrium under the action of its weight, the normal force from the ground, friction, and the force from the hinge. We analyze one half of the sign, using the dimensions from Figure 14.

From Figure 14:

- Total sign mass: $$ m = 8.00 \kg $$
- Each leg mass: $$ m/2 = 4.00 \kg $$
- Base width: 1.10 m, so each leg's base is 0.55 m from center
- Height of hinge: 1.30 m
- Chain is at 0.50 m below hinge (but chain is broken)
- Center of gravity of each leg is at its geometric center

**Solution for (a)**

Consider one half of the A-frame sign. The forces acting on it are:

- Weight $$ W = (4.00 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 39.2 \N $$ acting at the center of gravity
- Normal force $$ N $$ (upward) at the foot
- Friction force $$ f $$ (horizontal, toward center) at the foot
- Hinge force $$ F_h $$ at the top

For vertical equilibrium of one leg:

<div class="equation">
$$ N = W = 39.2 \N $$
</div>

Taking torques about the foot of the leg (to find the horizontal component of the hinge force):

The leg makes an angle with the vertical. From the geometry:

- Horizontal distance from foot to hinge: 0.55 m
- Vertical height of hinge: 1.30 m
- The cg of the leg is at half these values from the foot: 0.275 m horizontal, 0.65 m vertical

Torque due to weight (clockwise, about foot):
$$ \tau_W = W \times 0.275 \m = (39.2 \N)(0.275 \m) = 10.78 \text{ N·m} $$

Torque due to horizontal hinge force (counterclockwise, about foot):
$$ \tau*{Fh} = F*{h,horizontal} \times 1.30 \m $$

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{h,horizontal} \times 1.30 \m = 10.78 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{h,horizontal} = \frac{10.78}{1.30} = 8.29 \N $$
</div>

For horizontal equilibrium of one leg:

<div class="equation">
$$ f = F_{h,horizontal} = 8.29 \N $$
</div>

The minimum coefficient of friction:

<div class="equation">
$$ \mu_{min} = \frac{f}{N} = \frac{8.29 \N}{39.2 \N} = 0.212 $$
</div>

The minimum coefficient of friction is **0.212** (or approximately 0.21).

**Solution for (b)**

The hinge force on each side has:

- Horizontal component: $$ F\_{h,horizontal} = 8.29 \N $$ (pushing outward on each leg)
- Vertical component: $$ F\_{h,vertical} = 0 $$ (by symmetry, the vertical components from each leg must cancel at the hinge)

Wait, let me reconsider. The hinge connects the two legs. For each leg, the hinge exerts a force. By symmetry, the horizontal components push outward (away from center) on each leg, and any vertical component would need to be analyzed.

At the hinge, vertical equilibrium of each leg gives:
$$ N + F\_{h,vertical} = W $$

Since $$ N = W $$ from the analysis above, $$ F\_{h,vertical} = 0 $$.

Therefore, the force exerted by each side on the hinge is purely horizontal:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_h = F_{h,horizontal} = 8.29 \N \approx 8.3 \N $$
</div>

The force exerted by each side on the hinge is **8.3 N** horizontally.

**Discussion**

Without the chain, friction alone must prevent the legs from sliding apart. The required coefficient of friction (about 0.21) is modest and easily achieved on most surfaces like concrete or asphalt. However, on a smooth surface like wet tile or ice, the coefficient of friction might be lower, causing the sign to collapse. This is why A-frame signs often have rubber feet or textured pads—to ensure adequate friction in various conditions. The 8.3 N force at the hinge is relatively small compared to the problem with the chain (21.6 N), because without the chain, the legs can push against each other at the hinge with less constraint.
