* Discuss the rainbow formation by thin films.
</div>

The bright colors seen in an oil slick floating on water or in a sunlit soap
bubble are caused by interference. The brightest colors are those that interfere
constructively. This interference is between light reflected from different
surfaces of a thin film; thus, the effect is known as **thin film interference**
. As noticed before, interference effects are most prominent when light
interacts with something having a size similar to its wavelength. A thin film is
one having a thickness $$t $$ smaller than a few times the wavelength of light,
$$\lambda $$ . Since color is associated indirectly with $$\lambda $$ and since
all interference depends in some way on the ratio of $$\lambda $$ to the size of
the object involved, we should expect to see different colors for different
thicknesses of a film, as in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

![Soap bubbles reflecting mostly purple and blue light with some regions of orange.](../resources/Figure_27_07_01.jpg 'These soap bubbles exhibit brilliant colors when exposed to sunlight. (credit: Scott Robinson, Flickr)')
{: #Figure1}

What causes thin film interference? [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows how light
reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of a film can interfere. Incident
light is only partially reflected from the top surface of the film (ray 1). The
remainder enters the film and is itself partially reflected from the bottom
surface. Part of the light reflected from the bottom surface can emerge from the
top of the film (ray 2) and interfere with light reflected from the top (ray 1).
Since the ray that enters the film travels a greater distance, it may be in or
out of phase with the ray reflected from the top. However, consider for a
moment, again, the bubbles in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The bubbles are
darkest where they are thinnest. Furthermore, if you observe a soap bubble
carefully, you will note it gets dark at the point where it breaks. For very
thin films, the difference in path lengths of ray 1 and ray 2
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) is negligible; so why should they interfere
destructively and not constructively? The answer is that a phase change can
occur upon reflection. The rule is as follows:

**When light reflects from a medium having an index of refraction greater than
that of the medium in which it is traveling, a $$180 ^\circ $$ phase change (
or a $$\lambda /2 $$ shift) occurs.**

![The figure shows three materials, or media, stacked one upon the other. The topmost medium is labeled n one, the next is labeled n two and its thickness is t, and the lowest is labeled n three. A light ray labeled incident light starts in the n one medium and propagates down and to the right to strike the n one n two interface. The ray gets partially reflected and partially refracted. The partially reflected ray is labeled ray one. The refracted ray continues downward in the n two medium and is reflected back up from the n two n three interface. This reflected ray, labeled ray two, refracts again upon passing up through the n two n one interface and continues upward parallel to ray one. Ray one and ray two then enter an observer’s eye.](../resources/Figure_27_07_02.jpg 'Light striking a thin film is partially reflected (ray 1) and partially refracted at the top surface. The refracted ray is partially reflected at the bottom surface and emerges as ray 2. These rays will interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction of the various media.')
{: #Figure2}

If the film in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) is a soap bubble (essentially water with
air on both sides), then there is a $$\lambda /2 $$ shift for ray 1 and none for
ray 2. Thus, when the film is very thin, the path length difference between the
two rays is negligible, they are exactly out of phase, and destructive
interference will occur at all wavelengths and so the soap bubble will be dark
here.

The thickness of the film relative to the wavelength of light is the other
crucial factor in thin film interference. Ray 2 in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)
travels a greater distance than ray 1. For light incident perpendicular to the
surface, ray 2 travels a distance approximately $$2t $$ farther than ray 1. When
this distance is an integral or half-integral multiple of the wavelength in the
medium ( $${\lambda }_{n}=\lambda /n $$ , where $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength
in vacuum and $$n $$ is the index of refraction), constructive or destructive
interference occurs, depending also on whether there is a phase change in either
ray.

Thin-film interference has created an entire field of research and industrial applications. Its foundations were laid by Irving Langmuir and Katharine Burr Blodgett, working at General Electric in the 1920s and 1930s. Langmuir had pioneered a method for producing ultra-thin layers on materials. Blodgett built on these practices by creating a method to precisely stack and compress these layers in order to produce a film of a desired thickness and quality. The device they developed became known as the Langmuir-Blodgett trough, built from principles developed by Agnes Pockels and still used in laboratories today. The earliest widely applied use of these principles was non-reflective glass, which Blodgett patented in 1938 and which was used almost immediately in the making of
the film _Gone With the Wind_. The film is viewed as a tremendous leap in cinematography; cameras, microscopes, telescopes, and many other instruments rely on Blodgett's invention as well.

<div id="Example1" class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Non-reflective Lens Coating Using Thin Film Interference
</div>
Sophisticated cameras use a series of several lenses. Light can reflect from the surfaces of these various lenses and degrade image clarity. To limit these reflections, lenses are coated with a thin layer of magnesium fluoride that causes destructive thin film interference. What is the thinnest this film can be, if its index of refraction is 1.38 and it is designed to limit the reflection of 550-nm light, normally the most intense visible wavelength? The index of refraction of glass is 1.52.

**Strategy**

Refer to [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) and use $${n}_{1}=1.00 $$ for air, $${n}_{2}=1.38
$$ , and $${n}_{3}=1.52 $$ . Both ray 1 and ray 2 will have a $$\lambda /2 $$
shift upon reflection. Thus, to obtain destructive interference, ray 2 will need
to travel a half wavelength farther than ray 1. For rays incident
perpendicularly, the path length difference is $$2t $$.

**Solution**

To obtain destructive interference here,

<div class="equation" >
 $$2t=\frac{ {\lambda }_{ {n}_{2}}}{2}\text{,} $$
</div>
where  $${\lambda }_{ {n}_{2}} $$
 is the wavelength in the film and is given by  $${\lambda }_{ {n}_{2}}=\frac{\lambda }{ {n}_{2}} $$.

Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$2t=\frac{\lambda /{n}_{2}}{2}. $$
</div>
Solving for  $$t $$  and entering known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}t& =& \frac{\lambda /{n}_{2}}{4}=\frac{\left(550 \text{nm}\right)/1.38}{4}\\ & =& 99.6 \text{nm} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Films such as the one in this example are most effective in producing
destructive interference when the thinnest layer is used, since light over a
broader range of incident angles will be reduced in intensity. These films are
called non-reflective coatings; this is only an approximately correct
description, though, since other wavelengths will only be partially cancelled.
Non-reflective coatings are used in car windows and sunglasses.

</div>

Thin film interference is most constructive or most destructive when the path
length difference for the two rays is an integral or half-integral wavelength,
respectively. That is, for rays incident perpendicularly, $$2t={\lambda }_{n},
{2\lambda }_{n}, {3\lambda }_{n},\dots $$ or $$2t={\lambda }_{n}/2, {3\lambda }_
{n}/2, {5\lambda }_{n}/2,\dots $$ . To know whether interference is constructive
or destructive, you must also determine if there is a phase change upon
reflection. Thin film interference thus depends on film thickness, the
wavelength of light, and the refractive indices. For white light incident on a
film that varies in thickness, you will observe rainbow colors of constructive
interference for various wavelengths as the thickness varies.

Soap Bubbles: More Than One Thickness can be Constructive
</div>
(a) What are the three smallest thicknesses of a soap bubble that produce constructive interference for red light with a wavelength of 650 nm? The index of refraction of soap is taken to be the same as that of water. (b) What three smallest thicknesses will give destructive interference?

**Strategy and Concept**

Use [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) to visualize the bubble. Note that $${n}_{1}={n}_
{3}=1.00 $$ for air, and $${n}_{2}=1.333 $$ for soap (equivalent to water).
There is a $$\lambda /2 $$ shift for ray 1 reflected from the top surface of the
bubble, and no shift for ray 2 reflected from the bottom surface. To get
constructive interference, then, the path length difference ( $$2t $$ )
must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength—the first three being
$${\lambda }_{n}/2, {3\lambda }_{n}/2 $$ , and $${5\lambda }_{n}/2 $$ . To get
destructive interference, the path length difference must be an integral
multiple of the wavelength—the first three being $$0, {\lambda }_{n} $$ , and
$${2\lambda }\_{n} $$.

**Solution for (a)**

_Constructive interference_ occurs here when

<div class="equation" >
 $$2{t}_{\text{c}}=\frac{ {\lambda }_{n}}{2}, \frac{ {3\lambda }_{n}}{2}, \frac{ {5\lambda }_{n}}{2}\text{,}\dots . $$
</div>
The smallest constructive thickness  $${t}_{\text{c}} $$
 thus is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{t}_{\text{c}}& =& \frac{ {\lambda }_{n}}{4}=\frac{\lambda /n}{4}=\frac{\left(650 \text{nm}\right)/1.333}{4}\\ & =& 122 \text{nm} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
The next thickness that gives constructive interference is  $$t^{\prime}_{\text{c}}={3\lambda }_{n}/4 $$ ,
 so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$t^{\prime}_{\text{c}}=366 \text{nm} \text{.}  $$
</div>
Finally, the third thickness producing constructive interference is  $${t^{\prime\prime} }_{\text{c}}= {5\lambda }_{n}/4 $$ ,
 so that

<div class="equation" >
 $${t^{\prime\prime} }_{\text{c}}=610 \text{nm} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

For _destructive interference_, the path length difference here is an integral
multiple of the wavelength. The first occurs for zero thickness, since there is
a phase change at the top surface. That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $${t}_{\text{d}}=0. $$
</div>
The first non-zero thickness producing destructive interference is

<div class="equation" >
 $$2t^{\prime}_{\text{d}}={\lambda }_{n}. $$
</div>
Substituting known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}t^{\prime}_{\text{d}}& =& \frac{\lambda {}_{n} }{2}=\frac{\lambda /n}{2}=\frac{\left(650 \text{nm}\right)/1.333}{2}\\ & =& 244 \text{nm} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
Finally, the third destructive thickness is  $$2{t^{\prime\prime} }_{\text{d}}={2\lambda }_{n} $$ ,
 so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{t^{\prime\prime} }_{\text{d}}& =& {\lambda }_{n}=\frac{\lambda }{n}=\frac{650 \text{nm}}{1.333}\\ & =& 488 \text{nm} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

If the bubble was illuminated with pure red light, we would see bright and dark
bands at very uniform increases in thickness. First would be a dark band at 0
thickness, then bright at 122 nm thickness, then dark at 244 nm, bright at 366
nm, dark at 488 nm, and bright at 610 nm. If the bubble varied smoothly in
thickness, like a smooth wedge, then the bands would be evenly spaced.

</div>

Another example of thin film interference can be seen when microscope slides are
separated (see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). The slides are very flat, so that the
wedge of air between them increases in thickness very uniformly. A phase change
occurs at the second surface but not the first, and so there is a dark band
where the slides touch. The rainbow colors of constructive interference repeat,
going from violet to red again and again as the distance between the slides
increases. As the layer of air increases, the bands become more difficult to
see, because slight changes in incident angle have greater effects on path
length differences. If pure-wavelength light instead of white light is used,
then bright and dark bands are obtained rather than repeating rainbow colors.

![Figure A shows two microscope slides that have been pressed together. Multicolor swirling rainbow bands are visible coming from the slides. Figure B shows a cross section of two glass slides stacked one on top of the other. The lower slide is horizontal and the upper slide is tilted up at an angle that is larger than the actual angle between slides would be. Two rays come from above and impinge upon the slides. Their refraction and partial reflection is shown at each glass air interface.](../resources/Figure_27_07_03.jpg '(a) The rainbow color bands are produced by thin film interference in the air between the two glass slides. (b) Schematic of the paths taken by rays in the wedge of air between the slides.')
{: #Figure3}

An important application of thin film interference is found in the manufacturing
of optical instruments. A lens or mirror can be compared with a master as it is
being ground, allowing it to be shaped to an accuracy of less than a wavelength
over its entire surface. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) illustrates the
phenomenon called Newton’s rings, which occurs when the plane surfaces of two
lenses are placed together. (The circular bands are called Newton’s rings
because Isaac Newton described them and their use in detail. Newton did not
discover them; Robert Hooke did, and Newton did not believe they were due to the
wave character of light.) Each successive ring of a given color indicates an
increase of only one wavelength in the distance between the lens and the blank,
so that great precision can be obtained. Once the lens is perfect, there will be
no rings.

![This figure shows rainbow-colored concentric rings obtained when two plano-convex lenses are placed together with their flat surfaces in contact.](../resources/Figure_27_07_04.jpg "“Newton's rings” interference fringes are produced when two plano-convex lenses are placed together with their plane surfaces in contact. The rings are created by interference between the light reflected off the two surfaces as a result of a slight gap between them, indicating that these surfaces are not precisely plane but are slightly convex.

{: #Figure4}

The wings of certain moths and butterflies have nearly iridescent colors due to
thin film interference. In addition to pigmentation, the wing’s color is
affected greatly by constructive interference of certain wavelengths reflected
from its film-coated surface. Car manufacturers are offering special paint jobs
that use thin film interference to produce colors that change with angle. This
expensive option is based on variation of thin film path length differences with
angle. Security features on credit cards, banknotes, driving licenses and
similar items prone to forgery use thin film interference, diffraction gratings,
or holograms. Australia led the way with dollar bills printed on polymer with a
diffraction grating security feature making the currency difficult to forge.
Other countries such as New Zealand and Taiwan are using similar technologies,
while the United States currency includes a thin film interference effect.

### Problem-Solving Strategies for Wave Optics

{: #Note1}

**Step 1.** _Examine the situation to determine that interference is involved_.
Identify whether slits or thin film interference are considered in the problem.

**Step 2.** _If slits are involved_, note that diffraction gratings and double
slits produce very similar interference patterns, but that gratings have
narrower (sharper) maxima. Single slit patterns are characterized by a large
central maximum and smaller maxima to the sides.

**Step 3.** _If thin film interference is involved, take note of the path length
difference between the two rays that interfere_. Be certain to use the
wavelength in the medium involved, since it differs from the wavelength in
vacuum. Note also that there is an additional $$\lambda /2 $$ phase shift when
light reflects from a medium with a greater index of refraction.

**Step 4.** _Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (
identify the unknowns)_. A written list is useful. Draw a diagram of the
situation. Labeling the diagram is useful.

**Step 5.** _Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as
stated (identify the knowns)_.

**Step 6.** _Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (
the unknown), and enter the knowns_. Slits, gratings, and the Rayleigh limit
involve equations.

**Step 7.** _For thin film interference, you will have constructive interference
for a total shift that is an integral number of wavelengths. You will have
destructive interference for a total shift of a half-integral number of
wavelengths_. Always keep in mind that crest to crest is constructive whereas
crest to trough is destructive.

**Step 8.** _Check to see if the answer is reasonable: Does it make sense?_
Angles in interference patterns cannot be greater than $$90 ^\circ $$ , for
example.

### Section Summary

- Thin film interference occurs between the light reflected from the top and
  bottom surfaces of a film. In addition to the path length difference, there
  can be a phase change.
- When light reflects from a medium having an index of refraction greater than
  that of the medium in which it is traveling, a $$180 ^\circ $$ phase
  change (or a $$\lambda /2 $$ shift) occurs.

An oil slick on water is 120 nm thick and illuminated by white light incident perpendicular to its surface. What color does the oil appear (what is the most constructively reflected wavelength), given its index of refraction is 1.40?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For thin film interference, we need to consider phase changes at interfaces. At the air-oil interface (n = 1.00 to n = 1.40), there IS a phase change. At the oil-water interface (n = 1.40 to n = 1.33), there is NO phase change (going from higher to lower n). With one phase change, constructive interference occurs when: $$2tn = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$

**Solution**

Given:
- $$t = 120 \text{ nm}$$
- $$n_{\text{oil}} = 1.40$$
- Normal incidence

For constructive interference (with one phase change):

<div class="equation">
$$2tn = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$$
</div>

Solving for λ:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{2tn}{m + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2(120 \text{ nm})(1.40)}{m + 0.5} = \frac{336 \text{ nm}}{m + 0.5}$$
</div>

Calculate for different orders:
- **m = 0:** λ = 336/0.5 = 672 nm (red)
- **m = 1:** λ = 336/1.5 = 224 nm (UV, not visible)

**Discussion**

The oil appears **red** with λ = 672 nm. This is the only visible wavelength that experiences strong constructive interference. The color falls in the red portion of the visible spectrum (roughly 620-750 nm). This is why oil slicks display colorful patterns - different thicknesses reflect different colors, creating the characteristic rainbow appearance.

Find the minimum thickness of a soap bubble that appears red when illuminated by white light perpendicular to its surface. Take the wavelength to be 680 nm, and assume the same index of refraction as water.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A soap bubble is a thin film with air on both sides. There are phase changes at both the outer surface (air to soap, n increases) and inner surface (soap to air, n decreases)... wait, actually the inner surface goes from soap (n = 1.33) back to air (n = 1.00), so there's NO phase change there. Actually, let me reconsider: for a soap bubble, light reflects from both the outer and inner surfaces. The outer reflection (air n=1 to soap n=1.33) HAS a phase change. The inner reflection (soap n=1.33 to air n=1) has NO phase change. So overall, there's ONE phase change.

With one phase change, constructive interference: $$2tn = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$

For minimum thickness, use m = 0.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 680 \text{ nm}$$
- $$n = 1.33$$ (same as water)
- $$m = 0$$ (minimum thickness)

For constructive interference with one phase change:

<div class="equation">
$$2tn = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$$
</div>

With m = 0:

<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{\lambda}{4n} = \frac{680 \text{ nm}}{4(1.33)} = \frac{680}{5.32} = 128 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The minimum thickness is 128 nm, which is quite thin - less than the wavelength of red light in air. This quarter-wavelength condition (λ/4n) is characteristic of thin film interference with one phase change. Soap bubbles display beautiful colors because different thicknesses in different regions reflect different wavelengths. As a soap bubble drains and thins, it progresses through colors from red → yellow → green → blue before becoming essentially colorless and then black just before popping.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Following the Problem-Solving Strategies for Wave Optics:

**Step 1:** This is a thin film interference problem.
**Step 2:** We need to determine phase changes. Air (n = 1.00) → soapy water (n = 1.33) → Plexiglas (n ≈ 1.49). At the top surface (air to soap), there IS a phase change. At the bottom surface (soap to Plexiglas), there IS also a phase change (since 1.33 < 1.49). With TWO phase changes, they cancel out, so we use the condition for NO net phase change.
**Step 3:** For constructive interference with no net phase change: $$2tn = m\lambda$$
**Step 4:** Given: λ = 520 nm, n = 1.33, find t for m = 1, 2, 3.
**Step 5:** Solve for t.

**Solution**

For constructive interference (two phase changes, net = zero):

<div class="equation">
$$2tn = m\lambda$$
</div>

Solving for t:

<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{m\lambda}{2n} = \frac{m(520 \text{ nm})}{2(1.33)} = \frac{520m}{2.66} = 195m \text{ nm}$$
</div>

The three smallest non-zero thicknesses are:

<div class="equation">
$$t_1 = 195(1) = 195 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$t_2 = 195(2) = 390 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$t_3 = 195(3) = 585 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Step 6:** Check reasonableness: These thicknesses are on the order of the wavelength of light, which is typical for thin film interference effects.

**Discussion**

The three smallest thicknesses are 195 nm, 390 nm, and 585 nm. Each successive thickness differs by 195 nm (half the wavelength in the medium: λ/2n). These represent different orders of constructive interference. In practice, the first-order (195 nm) would appear brightest for green light, while higher orders might also reflect other wavelengths, producing mixed colors.

The path length difference is 2tn. For the bubble to appear dark at all visible wavelengths, this must be less than λ/4 for the shortest visible wavelength (violet, ~380 nm). With one phase change, destructive interference (darkness) occurs when 2tn < λ/4.

**Solution**

**(a) Maximum thickness for darkness:**

Given:
- $$n = 1.33$$ (water)
- $$\lambda_{\text{min}} = 380 \text{ nm}$$ (shortest visible, violet)

For the bubble to appear dark, the path length difference must be less than λ/4:

<div class="equation">
$$2t < \frac{\lambda_{\text{min}}}{4}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$t < \frac{\lambda_{\text{min}}}{8} = \frac{380 \text{ nm}}{8} = 47.5 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

But actually, we need $$2tn < \lambda_{\text{min}}/4$$, so:

<div class="equation">
$$t < \frac{\lambda_{\text{min}}}{8n} = \frac{380 \text{ nm}}{8(1.33)} = 35.7 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**(b) Fragility discussion:**

A thickness of 35.7 nm is extremely thin - only about 35-40 molecular layers of water. For comparison:
- A water molecule is roughly 0.3 nm in diameter
- This film is only about 100-120 molecules thick
- Typical soap films range from 10-1000 nm

At such minimal thickness, the soap bubble is extremely fragile:
- Very susceptible to evaporation
- Easily disrupted by air currents or vibrations
- Cannot support its own weight for long
- Will pop within seconds after reaching this thickness
- Any dust particle or temperature variation can rupture it

This is why soap bubbles show black patches just before they pop - these are the regions that have thinned to this critical thickness.

**Discussion**

The extreme thinness (36 nm) explains why soap bubbles are so delicate and short-lived. When you see a soap bubble develop a black spot, it will typically pop within 1-2 seconds, as that region has thinned to near molecular-scale dimensions where surface tension variations and thermal fluctuations easily cause rupture.

A film of oil on water will appear dark when it is very thin, because the path length difference becomes small compared with the wavelength of light and there is a phase shift at the top surface. If it becomes dark when the path length difference is less than one-fourth the wavelength, what is the thickest the oil can be and appear dark at all visible wavelengths? Oil has an index of refraction of 1.40.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows two glass slides illuminated by pure-wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on a 0.100-mm-diameter hair at the other end, forming a wedge of air. (a) How far apart are the dark bands, if the slides are 7.50 cm long and 589-nm light is used? (b) Is there any difference if the slides are made from crown or flint glass? Explain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The air wedge creates a varying thickness that produces interference fringes. There are two phase changes (both at glass surfaces from air), so they cancel. Dark bands occur when $$2t = m\lambda$$ for the air gap. The spacing between dark bands depends on how quickly the thickness changes along the slide.

**Solution**

**(a) Spacing of dark bands:**

Given:
- Length of slides: L = 7.50 cm = 0.0750 m
- Hair diameter (maximum air gap): h = 0.100 mm = 1.00 × 10⁻⁴ m
- Wavelength: λ = 589 nm = 589 × 10⁻⁹ m

The wedge angle is small:
<div class="equation">
$$\tan \alpha \approx \alpha = \frac{h}{L} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-4}}{0.0750} = 1.33 \times 10^{-3} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

At position x from the contact point, the air gap thickness is:
<div class="equation">
$$t(x) = x \tan \alpha \approx x\alpha$$
</div>

For dark fringes (with two phase changes, net = zero):
<div class="equation">
$$2t = m\lambda$$
</div>

The m-th dark fringe occurs at position:
<div class="equation">
$$x_m = \frac{m\lambda}{2\alpha}$$
</div>

The spacing between adjacent dark fringes is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = x_{m+1} - x_m = \frac{\lambda}{2\alpha} = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{2(1.33 \times 10^{-3})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{2.67 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.21 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} = 0.221 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**(b) Effect of glass type:**

**No, there is no difference** if the slides are made from crown or flint glass. The interference occurs in the air gap between the slides, not within the glass itself. The refractive index of the glass doesn't affect the optical path length in the air wedge. As long as both slides are made of the same type of glass (or even different types), the interference pattern depends only on the air gap geometry and the wavelength of light.

**Discussion**

The fringe spacing of 0.221 mm means there are about 340 dark fringes across the 7.50-cm length of the slides. This creates a closely-spaced pattern of light and dark bands. This technique (called a Fizeau interferometer when done precisely) is used to test optical flatness of surfaces - any irregularities in the glass surfaces would cause deviations in the otherwise straight, equally-spaced fringes.

Repeat [[Exercise 1]](#Exercise1), but take the light to be incident at a  $$45 ^\circ $$ angle.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Exercise 1 involves calculating wavelengths for thin film interference. At non-normal incidence, we must account for the angle of refraction in the film using Snell's law, and the path length in the film changes. The condition becomes $$2tn\cos \theta_2 = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$ where θ₂ is the refraction angle in the film.

**Solution**

Exercise 1 asks about interference from a thin film. When light is incident at 45°, we need to find the refraction angle in the film.

Using Snell's law at the air-film interface (assuming n_film ~ 1.33 for soap):

<div class="equation">
$$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$(1.00) \sin 45° = (1.33) \sin \theta_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{0.7071}{1.33} = 0.532$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = 32.1°$$
</div>

The optical path length in the film is now 2tn cos θ₂ (where the cos factor accounts for the longer path at an angle).

For constructive interference with one phase change:

<div class="equation">
$$2tn\cos \theta_2 = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$$
</div>

Compared to normal incidence where $$2tn = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$, the factor $$\cos 32.1° = 0.846$$ means the effective optical path is reduced by about 15%.

This causes the interference pattern to shift - wavelengths that were constructively interfering at normal incidence will no longer do so at 45°, and different colors will be reflected. The film will appear to change color when viewed from different angles.

**Discussion**

This angle-dependence of color is why soap bubbles and oil slicks show different colors when viewed from different angles. The color you see depends on your viewing angle. This effect is also exploited in security features on currency and in decorative coatings. The exact color shift calculation would require the specific film thickness from Exercise 1, but the principle is clear: tilting the film effectively reduces the optical path length, shifting the interference pattern toward shorter wavelengths.

**Unreasonable Results**

To save money on making military aircraft invisible to radar, an inventor
decides to coat them with a non-reflective material having an index of
refraction of 1.20, which is between that of air and the surface of the plane.
This, he reasons, should be much cheaper than designing Stealth bombers. (a)
What thickness should the coating be to inhibit the reflection of 4.00-cm
wavelength radar? (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which
assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a non-reflective (anti-reflection) coating, we need destructive interference of reflected waves. With n_air (1.00) < n_coating (1.20) < n_aircraft (assume ~metal, very high n), there's one phase change. For destructive interference: $$2tn = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$. The minimum thickness uses m = 0.

**Solution**

**(a) Required coating thickness:**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 4.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0400 \text{ m}$$
- $$n = 1.20$$
- For minimum thickness, $$m = 0$$

For destructive interference (anti-reflection):

<div class="equation">
$$2tn = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$$
</div>

With m = 0:

<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{\lambda}{4n} = \frac{0.0400 \text{ m}}{4(1.20)} = \frac{0.0400}{4.80} = 8.33 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$t = 8.33 \text{ mm} = 0.833 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**(b) What is unreasonable about this result?**

A coating thickness of **8.33 mm (almost 1 cm)** is extremely impractical for aircraft:
- It's very thick and heavy - coating an entire aircraft would add enormous weight
- The coating would be structurally weak and easily damaged
- It would significantly alter the aerodynamics of the aircraft
- For a fighter jet with ~200 m² surface area, this would add several thousand kilograms
- The coating would crack, peel, or delaminate under flight stresses
- It would require constant maintenance and reapplication

**(c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?**

The main unreasonable assumptions are:

1. **Radar wavelengths are much longer than optical wavelengths**: Radar operates at cm wavelengths, while anti-reflection coatings for visible light are only ~100 nm thick. The coating thickness scales with wavelength.

2. **Single-wavelength approach**: Radar systems use multiple frequencies, so a coating optimized for 4.00 cm wouldn't work for other radar wavelengths.

3. **Practical feasibility**: The assumption that a simple dielectric coating could substitute for stealth technology ignores:
   - The need for thin, durable coatings
   - Multiple wavelength coverage
   - Radar-absorbing materials (not just anti-reflection)
   - Aircraft shape design for radar deflection
   - Maintenance and durability requirements

**Discussion**

Real stealth technology uses radar-absorbing materials (RAM) that are thin, incorporate conductive particles to dissipate radar energy as heat, and are combined with aircraft shapes designed to deflect radar. A simple anti-reflection coating with cm-scale thickness is completely impractical. This problem illustrates why actual stealth aircraft like the B-2 and F-117 required sophisticated engineering rather than simple solutions.
