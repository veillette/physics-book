</div>

Simple machines are devices that can be used to multiply or augment a force that
we apply – often at the expense of a distance through which we apply the force.
The word for “machine” comes from the Greek word meaning “to help make things
easier.” Levers, gears, pulleys, wedges, and screws are some examples of
machines. Energy is still conserved for these devices because a machine cannot
do more work than the energy put into it. However, machines can reduce the input
force that is needed to perform the job. The ratio of output to input force
magnitudes for any simple machine is called its **mechanical advantage** (MA).

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{MA}=\frac{ F_{\text{o}}}{ F_{\text{i}}} $$
</div>

One of the simplest machines is the lever, which is a rigid bar pivoted at a
fixed place called the fulcrum. Torques are involved in levers, since there is
rotation about a pivot point. Distances from the physical pivot of the lever are
crucial, and we can obtain a useful expression for the MA in terms of these
distances.

![There is a nail in a wooden plank. A nail puller is being used to pull the nail out of the plank. A hand is applying force F sub I downward on the handle of the nail puller. The top of the nail exerts a force F sub N downward on the puller. At the point where the nail puller touches the plank, the reaction of the surface force N is applied. At the top of the figure, a free body diagram is shown.](../resources/Figure_09_05_01.jpg 'A nail puller is a lever with a large mechanical advantage. The external forces on the nail puller are represented by solid arrows. The force that the nail puller applies to the nail (  ( F_o ) )  is not a force on the nail puller. The reaction force the nail exerts back on the puller ( ( F_n ) )  is an external force and is equal and opposite to ( F_o ) . The perpendicular lever arms of the input and output forces are ( l_i ) and ( l_0 ).')
{: #Figure1}

[Figure 1](#Figure1) shows a lever type that is used as a nail puller. Crowbars,
seesaws, and other such levers are all analogous to this one. $$ \vb{F}_ {\text{i}} $$ is the input force and $$ \vb{F}_{\text{o}} $$ is the output
force. There are three vertical forces acting on the nail puller (
the system of interest) – these are $$ \vb{F}_{\text{i}}, \vb{F}_{\N } $$, and
$$ \vb{N} $$. $$ \vb{F}_{\N } $$ is the reaction force back on the system, equal
and opposite to $$ \vb{F}_{\text{o}} $$. (Note that $$ \vb{F}_{\text{o}} $$ is
not a force on the system.) $$ \vb{N} $$ is the normal force upon the lever,
and its torque is zero since it is exerted at the pivot. The torques due to $$ \vb{F}_ {\text{i}} $$ and $$ \vb{F}_{\N } $$ must be equal to each other if the nail is
not moving, to satisfy the second condition for equilibrium $$ \left( \text{net}\tau =0\right) $$. (In order for the nail to actually move, the torque
due to $$ \vb{F}_{\text{i}} $$ must be ever-so-slightly greater than torque due
to $$ \vb{F}\_{\N } $$.) Hence,

<div class="equation">
 $$ l_{\text{i}}F_{\text{i}}=l_{\text{o}}F_{\text{o}} $$
</div>

where $$ l_{\text{i}} $$ and $$ l_{\text{o}} $$ are the distances from where the
input and output forces are applied to the pivot, as shown in the figure.
Rearranging the last equation gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ F_{\text{o}}}{ F_{\text{i}}}=\frac{ l_{\text{i}}}{ l_{\text{o}}}. $$
</div>

What interests us most here is that the magnitude of the force exerted by the
nail puller, $$F_{\text{o}}$$, is much greater than the magnitude of the input
force applied to the puller at the other end, $$ F\_{\text{i}} $$. For the nail
puller,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{MA}=\frac{ F_{\text{o}}}{ F_{\text{i}}}=\frac{ l_{\text{i}}}{ l_{\text{o}}}. $$
</div>

This equation is true for levers in general. For the nail puller, the MA is
certainly greater than one. The longer the handle on the nail puller, the
greater the force you can exert with it.

Two other types of levers that differ slightly from the nail puller are a
wheelbarrow and a shovel, shown in [Figure 2](#Figure2). All these lever types are
similar in that only three forces are involved – the input force, the output
force, and the force on the pivot – and thus their MAs are given by $$ \text{MA}=\frac{ F_{\text{o}}}{ F_{\text{i}}} $$ and $$ \text{MA}=\frac{ d_{1}}{ d_{2}} $$, with distances being measured relative to the physical pivot. The
wheelbarrow and shovel differ from the nail puller because both the input and
output forces are on the same side of the pivot.

In the case of the wheelbarrow, the output force or load is between the pivot (
the wheel’s axle) and the input or applied force. In the case of the shovel, the
input force is between the pivot (at the end of the handle) and the load, but
the input lever arm is shorter than the output lever arm. In this case, the MA
is less than one.

![A wheelbarrow is shown in which the input force F sub I is shown as a vector in vertically upward direction below the handle of wheelbarrow. The weight of the wheelbarrow is downward at the center of gravity. The normal reaction of the ground is acting at the wheel in upward direction. The perpendicular distance between the normal reaction and the input force F sub I is labeled as R sub I and the distance between output force F sub O and normal reaction is labeled as R sub O. In figure b, a man is holding a shovel in his hands. One hand is at one end of the handle and the other hand is holding the shovel at the middle. The center of gravity of the shovel is at its flat end. The weight of the shovel is acting at the center of gravity. The input force is acting at the hand in the middle in upward direction and the end of the shovel is acting as pivot. A free body diagram is also shown at the right side of the figure.](../resources/Figure_09_05_02.jpg '(a) In the case of the wheelbarrow, the output force or load is between the pivot and the input force. The pivot is the wheel’s axle. Here, the output force is greater than the input force. Thus, a wheelbarrow enables you to lift much heavier loads than you could with your body alone. (b) In the case of the shovel, the input force is between the pivot and the load, but the input lever arm is shorter than the output lever arm. The pivot is at the handle held by the right hand. Here, the output force (supporting the shovel’s load) is less than the input force (from the hand nearest the load), because the input is exerted closer to the pivot than is the output.')

<div class="title">
What is the Advantage for the Wheelbarrow?
</div>
In the wheelbarrow of [Figure 2](#Figure2), the load has a perpendicular lever arm of 7.50 cm, while the hands have a perpendicular lever arm of 1.02 m.
(a) What upward force must you exert to support the wheelbarrow and its load if their combined mass is 45.0 kg?
(b) What force does the wheelbarrow exert on the ground?

**Strategy**

Here, we use the concept of mechanical advantage.

**Solution**

(a) In this case, $$ \frac{ F_{\text{o}}}{ F_{\text{i}}}=\frac{ l_{i}}{ l_{o}} $$

becomes

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{i}}=F_{\text{o}}\frac{ l_{o}}{ l_{i}}. $$
</div>
Adding values into this equation yields

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{i}}=\left(45.0\kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)\frac{0.075 \m }{1.02 \m }=32.4 \N . $$
</div>
The free-body diagram (see [Figure 2](#Figure2)) gives the following normal force: $$ F_{i}+N=W $$. Therefore, $$ N=\left(45.0 \kg \right)\left( 9.80\mss \right)-32.4 \N = 409 \N $$. $$ N $$ is the normal force acting on the wheel; by Newton’s third law, the force the
wheel exerts on the ground is $$ 409 \N $$.

**Discussion**

An even longer handle would reduce the force needed to lift the load. The MA
here is $$\text{MA}=1.02/0.0750=13.6 $$.

</div>

Another very simple machine is the inclined plane. Pushing a cart up a plane is
easier than lifting the same cart straight up to the top using a ladder, because
the applied force is less. However, the work done in both cases (assuming the
work done by friction is negligible) is the same. Inclined lanes or ramps were
probably used during the construction of the Egyptian pyramids to move large
blocks of stone to the top.

A crank is a lever that can be rotated $$ 360^\circ $$ about its pivot, as shown
in [Figure 3](#Figure3). Such a machine may not look like a lever, but the physics
of its actions remain the same. The MA for a crank is simply the ratio of the
radii $$ r_{\text{i}}/r_{0} $$. Wheels and gears have this simple expression for
their MAs too. The MA can be greater than 1, as it is for the crank, or less
than 1, as it is for the simplified car axle driving the wheels, as shown. If
the axle’s radius is $$ 2.0 \text{cm} $$ and the wheel’s radius is $$ 24.0 \text{cm} $$, then $$ \text{MA}=2.0/24.0=0.083 $$ and the axle would have to
exert a force of $$ 12 000 \N $$ on the wheel to enable it to exert a force of
$$ 1000 \N $$ on the ground.

![In figure a, a crank lever is shown in which a hand is at the handle of the crank lever. The output force F sub O is at the base of the lever and the input force F sub I is at the handle of the lever. The distance between input force and output force is labeled as R sub I. In figure b, a simplified axle of the car is shown. The input force is shown as a vector F sub I on the axle toward right. The output force is shown at the point of contact of the wheel with the ground toward left. The distance between the output force and the pivot point is labeled as R sub O. In figure c, rope over the pulley is shown. The input force is shown as a downward arrow at the left part of rope. The output force is acting on the right part of the rope. The center of the pulley is the pivot point. The distances of the two forces from the pivot are R sub I and R sub O respectively.](../resources/Figure_09_05_03.jpg "(a) A crank is a type of lever that can be rotated &#10; &#10; 360&#xBA; &#10; &#10; about its pivot. Cranks are usually designed to have a large MA. (b) A simplified automobile axle drives a wheel, which has a much larger diameter than the axle. The MA is less than 1.
(c) An ordinary pulley is used to lift a heavy load. The pulley changes the direction of the force &#10; &#10; T &#10; &#10; exerted by the cord without changing its magnitude. Hence, this machine has an MA of 1.")
{: #Figure3}

An ordinary pulley has an MA of 1; it only changes the direction of the force
and not its magnitude. Combinations of pulleys, such as those illustrated
in [Figure 4](#Figure4), are used to multiply force. If the pulleys are
friction-free, then the force output is approximately an integral multiple of
the tension in the cable. The number of cables pulling directly upward on the
system of interest, as illustrated in the figures given below, is approximately
the MA of the pulley system. Since each attachment applies an external force in
approximately the same direction as the others, they add, producing a total
force that is nearly an integral multiple of the input force $$ T $$.

![In figure a, a rope over two pulleys is shown. One pulley is fixed at the roof and the other is hanging through the rope. A weight is hanging from the second pulley. The tensions T are shown at the two parts of hanging pulley and at the free end of the rope. The mechanical advantage of the system is two. In figure b, a set of three pulleys is shown. A pulley is fixed at the roof with another pulley below it. The third pulley is hanging through the rope with a weight hanging at it. The tensions on the rope are shown as vectors on the rope and at the end of the rope. In figure c, set of three pulleys is shown. One of the pulleys is fixed at the roof. Two connected pulleys are hanging through a rope over the first pulley. The directions of the tensions are marked on the ropes and at the end of the rope.](../resources/Figure_09_05_04.jpg "(a) The combination of pulleys is used to multiply force. The force is an integral multiple of tension if the pulleys are frictionless. This pulley system has two cables attached to its load, thus applying a force of approximately \( 2T \). This machine has \( MA \approx 2 \). (b) Three pulleys are used to lift a load in such a way that the mechanical advantage is about 3. Effectively, there are three cables attached to the load.
(c) This pulley system applies a force of \( 4 T \) , so that it has \( MA \approx 4 \). Effectively, four cables are pulling on the system of interest. ")

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Scissors are like a double-lever system. Which of the simple machines in [Figure 1](#Figure1) and [Figure 2](#Figure2) is most analogous to scissors?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze the structure of scissors and compare it to the lever configurations shown in Figures 1 and 2. Scissors have two crossed blades that pivot at a central fulcrum, with the input force applied at the handles and the output force applied at the cutting edges.

**Solution**

Scissors are most analogous to the **nail puller** shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1).

In scissors:
- The **fulcrum (pivot point)** is at the screw or rivet where the two blades cross
- The **input force** is applied at the handles (far from the pivot)
- The **output force** is exerted at the cutting edges (closer to the pivot)

This is the same configuration as the nail puller, where:
- The pivot is between the input and output forces
- The input lever arm (from pivot to handles) is longer than the output lever arm (from pivot to blades)
- This gives scissors a mechanical advantage greater than 1

**Discussion**

This is why scissors have long handles relative to their cutting blades—the longer handles increase the mechanical advantage, allowing us to cut through tough materials with relatively little effort. Different types of scissors vary their MA: fabric scissors have longer blades for smooth cuts, while sheet metal snips have very short blades and very long handles for maximum cutting force. This is a first-class lever system.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Suppose you pull a nail at a constant rate using a nail puller as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1). Is the nail puller in equilibrium? What if you pull the nail with some acceleration – is the nail puller in equilibrium then? In which case is the force applied to the nail puller larger and why?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply the conditions for equilibrium. A system is in equilibrium when the net force and net torque are zero, which means there is no acceleration.

**Solution**

**Constant rate (constant velocity):** Yes, the nail puller **is in equilibrium**. When moving at constant velocity, acceleration is zero. By Newton's first law, this means the net force is zero, and the net torque is also zero. All forces and torques are balanced.

**With acceleration:** No, the nail puller **is not in equilibrium**. When accelerating, there must be a net force and/or net torque acting on the system.

**Which case requires more force?** The force applied to the nail puller is **larger when pulling with acceleration**.

Here's why:
- When in equilibrium (constant rate): $$ F_{\text{input}} \cdot l_i = F_{\text{nail}} \cdot l_o $$
- When accelerating: $$ F_{\text{input}} \cdot l_i = F_{\text{nail}} \cdot l_o + I\alpha $$

where $$ I\alpha $$ represents the additional torque needed to produce angular acceleration. The input force must not only overcome the resistance from the nail but also provide the extra force to accelerate the system.

**Discussion**

This is analogous to pushing a car: maintaining constant velocity requires only enough force to overcome friction, while accelerating requires additional force according to $$ F = ma $$. In practice, a skilled user pulls nails at nearly constant speed, minimizing the required force and reducing fatigue.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Why are the forces exerted on the outside world by the limbs of our bodies usually much smaller than the forces exerted by muscles inside the body?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze the lever systems in the body, recognizing that muscles are typically attached very close to joints while the load is applied at the end of limbs far from the joint.

**Solution**

The forces exerted on the outside world by limbs are smaller than the forces exerted by muscles because most skeletal muscle systems have a **mechanical advantage much less than 1**.

This occurs because:
1. **Muscles attach close to joints:** Tendons typically connect muscles to bones very near the pivot point (joint). This creates a short input lever arm ($$ l_i $$).

2. **Loads are applied far from joints:** We interact with the outside world at the ends of our limbs (hands, feet), which are far from the joint. This creates a long output lever arm ($$ l_o $$).

3. **MA relationship:** For levers, $$ \text{MA} = \frac{F_{\text{output}}}{F_{\text{input}}} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} $$

Since $$ l_i < l_o $$ in most body systems, $$ \text{MA} < 1 $$, which means $$ F_{\text{muscle}} > F_{\text{output}} $$.

**Example:** In the forearm system, the biceps attaches about 4 cm from the elbow, but the hand is about 35 cm from the elbow. This gives $$ \text{MA} \approx 4/35 \approx 0.11 $$, meaning the muscle force must be about 9 times larger than the force exerted by the hand.

**Discussion**

While this seems inefficient for force production, it provides advantages in speed and range of motion. A small muscle contraction produces a large movement at the hand, allowing fast, sweeping motions that would be impossible if muscles were attached at the ends of limbs.
</div>
</div>

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Explain why the forces in our joints are several times larger than the forces we exert on the outside world with our limbs. Can these forces be even greater than muscle forces (see previous Question)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply equilibrium analysis to the lever systems in the body. The joint force must balance both the muscle force and the external load, and since these often act in opposite directions relative to the joint, the forces can add together.

**Solution**

Joint forces are larger than external forces because **joints must support both the large muscle forces and the reaction to those forces**.

Consider the forearm example from [Figure 1](#Figure1) in the text:
- The biceps exerts an upward force $$ F_B = 470 \N $$
- The combined weight supported is only $$ 63.7 \N $$
- The elbow joint must exert $$ F_E = 407 \N $$ downward

**Why this happens:**
1. The muscle pulls up on the forearm with a large force (due to MA < 1)
2. For force equilibrium: $$ F_B = F_E + W $$ where W is the load
3. Therefore: $$ F_E = F_B - W = 470 - 63.7 = 407 \N $$

**Can joint forces exceed muscle forces?** Yes, they can!

This occurs when:
- The geometry causes the muscle and external forces to have components in the same direction relative to the joint
- The joint must then support the sum of both forces

For example, in the spine when lifting with a bent back (see [Figure 4](#Figure4) in section 6), the vertebral force $$ F_V = 4660 \N $$ exceeds the back muscle force $$ F_B = 4200 \N $$ because the forces add vectorially.

**Discussion**

This explains why joint damage (arthritis, torn cartilage, damaged discs) is so common. Even modest external loads create enormous internal forces that wear down joint surfaces over time, especially with repetitive motions or poor posture.
</div>
</div>

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the mechanical advantage of a nail puller—similar to the one shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1) —where you exert a force $$ 45 \text{cm} $$
from the pivot and the nail is $$ 1.8 \text{cm} $$
on the other side? What minimum force must you exert to apply a force of $$ 1250 \N  $$
to the nail?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Use the mechanical advantage formula for a lever: $$ \text{MA} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} = \frac{F_o}{F_i} $$, where $$ l_i $$ is the distance from pivot to input force and $$ l_o $$ is the distance from pivot to output force.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Input lever arm: $$ l_i = 45\text{ cm} = 0.45\text{ m} $$
- Output lever arm: $$ l_o = 1.8\text{ cm} = 0.018\text{ m} $$
- Output force on nail: $$ F_o = 1250\text{ N} $$

**Mechanical advantage:**
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{MA} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} = \frac{45\text{ cm}}{1.8\text{ cm}} = 25 $$
</div>

**Minimum force required:**
<div class="equation">
$$ F_i = \frac{F_o}{\text{MA}} = \frac{1250\text{ N}}{25} = 50\text{ N} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The mechanical advantage of 25 is quite impressive - you only need to exert 50 N (about 11 pounds) to apply 1250 N (about 280 pounds) to the nail. This is why nail pullers are so effective. The long handle multiplies your force by 25 times. However, you must move your hand 25 times farther than the nail moves - when the nail moves 1 mm, your hand moves 25 mm. Energy is conserved, but the work is made easier.

**Answer**

The mechanical advantage is **25**, and the minimum force required is **50 N**.

</div>
</div>

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Suppose you needed to raise a 250-kg mower a distance of 6.0 cm above the ground to change a tire. If you had a 2.0-m long lever, where would you place the fulcrum if your force was limited to 300 N?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a lever problem where we need to find the position of the fulcrum. We use the mechanical advantage relationship: $$ \text{MA} = \frac{F_o}{F_i} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} $$. The total length of the lever is the sum of the input and output lever arms: $$ l_i + l_o = 2.0 \m $$.

**Solution**

First, calculate the weight of the mower (the output force needed):

<div class="equation">
$$ F_o = mg = (250 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 2450 \N $$
</div>

The required mechanical advantage is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{MA} = \frac{F_o}{F_i} = \frac{2450 \N}{300 \N} = 8.17 $$
</div>

Using the lever relationship:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{l_i}{l_o} = 8.17 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ l_i = 8.17 \cdot l_o $$
</div>

Since the total lever length is 2.0 m:

<div class="equation">
$$ l_i + l_o = 2.0 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 8.17 \cdot l_o + l_o = 2.0 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 9.17 \cdot l_o = 2.0 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ l_o = \frac{2.0 \m}{9.17} = 0.218 \m \approx 22 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

The fulcrum should be placed **22 cm (0.22 m) from the mower** (or equivalently, 1.78 m from where you apply your force).

**Discussion**

This result makes sense: to lift a heavy load with a small force, the fulcrum must be placed very close to the load. The input lever arm (1.78 m) is about 8 times longer than the output lever arm (0.22 m), giving the required mechanical advantage of about 8. Note that while the force is reduced, the distance you must push down is proportionally larger than the distance the mower rises—energy is conserved.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the mechanical advantage of a wheelbarrow, such as the one in [Figure 2](#Figure2), if the center of gravity of the wheelbarrow and its load has a perpendicular lever arm of 5.50 cm, while the hands have a perpendicular lever arm of 1.02 m?
(b) What upward force should you exert to support the wheelbarrow and its load if their combined mass is 55.0 kg?
(c) What force does the wheel exert on the ground?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a wheelbarrow, the mechanical advantage is the ratio of lever arms. Use $$ \text{MA} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} $$. For parts (b) and (c), apply equilibrium conditions.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Load lever arm: $$ l_o = 5.50\text{ cm} = 0.0550\text{ m} $$
- Hands lever arm: $$ l_i = 1.02\text{ m} $$
- Combined mass: $$ m = 55.0\text{ kg} $$

**(a) Mechanical advantage:**
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{MA} = \frac{l_i}{l_o} = \frac{1.02\text{ m}}{0.0550\text{ m}} = 18.5 $$
</div>

**(b) Upward force to support the load:**

The output force is the weight of the wheelbarrow and load:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_o = mg = (55.0\text{ kg})(9.80\mss) = 539\text{ N} $$
</div>

The input force is:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_i = \frac{F_o}{\text{MA}} = \frac{539\text{ N}}{18.5} = 29.1\text{ N} $$
</div>

**(c) Force the wheel exerts on the ground:**

Using equilibrium (forces must sum to zero):
<div class="equation">
$$ N = F_o - F_i = mg - F_i = 539\text{ N} - 29.1\text{ N} = 510\text{ N} $$
</div>

By Newton's third law, the wheel exerts **510 N downward** on the ground.

**Discussion**

The mechanical advantage of 18.5 means you only need to exert about 29 N (about 6.5 pounds) to support a 55-kg load (121 pounds)! The wheelbarrow is an excellent example of how simple machines make work easier. The wheel bears most of the load (510 N), while your hands provide only the small force needed to maintain equilibrium. The long handles and position of the wheel close to the load create this large mechanical advantage.

**Answer**

(a) The mechanical advantage is **18.5**.

(b) The upward force required is **29.1 N**.

(c) The wheel exerts **510 N downward** on the ground.

A typical car has an axle with $$ 1.10 \text{cm} $$ radius driving a tire with a radius of $$ 27.5 \text{cm} $$. What is its mechanical advantage assuming the very simplified model
in [Figure 3](#Figure3)(b)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a wheel and axle system like [Figure 3](#Figure3)(b), the mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input radius (axle) to the output radius (wheel): $$ \text{MA} = \frac{r_i}{r_o} $$. In this case, the axle applies the input force and the wheel exerts the output force on the ground.

**Solution**

Given:
- Axle radius: $$ r_i = 1.10 \text{ cm} $$
- Tire radius: $$ r_o = 27.5 \text{ cm} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{MA} = \frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{1.10 \text{ cm}}{27.5 \text{ cm}} = 0.0400 $$
</div>

The mechanical advantage is **0.0400** (or equivalently, 1/25).

**Discussion**

A mechanical advantage less than 1 means the system is designed for speed rather than force multiplication. The wheel travels 25 times farther than the axle rotates through, but the force on the ground is only 1/25 of the force applied by the axle. This is desirable for vehicles: a small rotation of the engine/axle produces a large distance traveled by the wheel. The tradeoff is that the axle must exert very large forces—this is why car axles are built so strong. If you want to apply 1000 N to the road, the axle must exert 25,000 N!

What force does the nail puller in [Figure 1](#Figure1) exert on the supporting
surface? The nail puller has a mass of 2.10 kg.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Apply the equilibrium condition: the sum of all forces on the nail puller must equal zero. Use the values from Problem 1, where we found the mechanical advantage is 25 and the output force on the nail is 1250 N.

**Solution**

**Given (from Problem 1 and figure):**
- Input force: $$ F_i = 50\text{ N} $$ (downward at handle)
- Reaction force from nail: $$ F_N = 1250\text{ N} $$ (downward, equal and opposite to force on nail)
- Mass of nail puller: $$ m = 2.10\text{ kg} $$
- Weight of nail puller: $$ W = mg = (2.10)(9.80) = 20.6\text{ N} $$ (downward)

For equilibrium, the sum of vertical forces equals zero:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_i + F_N + W = N $$
</div>

where $$ N $$ is the normal force from the supporting surface (upward).

<div class="equation">
$$ N = F_i + F_N + W = 50\text{ N} + 1250\text{ N} + 20.6\text{ N} = 1321\text{ N} \approx 1.3 \times 10^3\text{ N} $$
</div>

By Newton's third law, the nail puller exerts a force of **1.3 × 10³ N** downward on the supporting surface.

**Discussion**

The supporting surface must bear the brunt of the forces - it supports not only the force pulling up on the nail (as a reaction) but also the input force and the weight of the puller. This explains why nail pulling can damage surfaces beneath the fulcrum, and why carpenters often place a piece of scrap wood under the nail puller to protect finished surfaces and distribute this large force.

**Answer**

The nail puller exerts $$ 1.3 \times 10^3\text{ N} $$ on the supporting surface.

If you used an ideal pulley of the type shown in [Figure 4](#Figure4)(a)
to support a car engine of mass $$ 115 \kg $$,
(a) What would be the tension in the rope?
(b) What force must the ceiling supply, assuming you pull straight down on the rope?
Neglect the pulley system's mass.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The pulley system in [Figure 4](#Figure4)(a) has two rope segments pulling up on the load, giving it a mechanical advantage of approximately 2. The tension in the rope is uniform throughout (for an ideal, frictionless pulley). For part (b), we apply force equilibrium to the upper pulley.

**Solution for (a)**

The weight of the engine is:

<div class="equation">
$$ W = mg = (115 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 1127 \N $$
</div>

In the pulley system shown in [Figure 4](#Figure4)(a), there are two rope segments supporting the load. Each carries the same tension $$ T $$. For equilibrium of the lower pulley and load:

<div class="equation">
$$ 2T = W $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{W}{2} = \frac{1127 \N}{2} = 564 \N $$
</div>

The tension in the rope is **564 N** (or $$ 5.64 \times 10^{2} \N $$).

**Solution for (b)**

The ceiling must support the upper pulley, which has three rope forces acting on it:
- Two segments of rope going down to the lower pulley, each with tension $$ T $$
- One segment where you pull down with force $$ T $$

All three rope segments pull down on the upper pulley, so the ceiling must supply an upward force:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{ceiling}} = 3T = 3(564 \N) = 1690 \N $$
</div>

The ceiling must supply **1690 N** (or $$ 1.69 \times 10^{3} \N $$) upward.

**Discussion**

Note that the ceiling force (1690 N) is greater than the engine weight (1127 N)! This makes sense because the ceiling must support not only the engine but also counteract the downward force you apply when pulling on the rope. The extra 564 N represents your pull. The mechanical advantage of 2 means you only need to pull with half the engine's weight, but the ceiling picks up the slack.

Repeat the previous exercise for the pulley shown in [Figure 4](#Figure4)(c),
assuming you pull straight up on the rope. The pulley system’s mass is $$ 7.00 \kg $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For [Figure 4](#Figure4)(c), this is a more complex pulley system with a mechanical advantage of 4 (four rope segments support the load). The total weight includes the engine plus the pulley system. Since you pull straight up, your force adds to the ceiling support.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Engine mass: $$ m_{engine} = 115\text{ kg} $$
- Pulley system mass: $$ m_{pulley} = 7.00\text{ kg} $$
- Total mass: $$ m_{total} = 115 + 7.00 = 122\text{ kg} $$

**(a) Tension in the rope:**

Total weight to support:
<div class="equation">
$$ W = m_{total}g = (122\text{ kg})(9.80\mss) = 1196\text{ N} $$
</div>

In [Figure 4](#Figure4)(c), four rope segments support the load, giving MA = 4:
<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{W}{4} = \frac{1196\text{ N}}{4} = 299\text{ N} $$
</div>

**(b) Force the ceiling must supply:**

When you pull straight up on the rope with tension $$ T $$, you exert an upward force that helps support the system. The ceiling only needs to supply the rest:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{ceiling} = W - T = 1196\text{ N} - 299\text{ N} = 897\text{ N} $$
</div>

The ceiling must supply **897 N upward**.

**Discussion**

This pulley arrangement is more efficient than the one in the previous problem. With MA = 4, you only need to pull with 299 N (about 67 pounds) to lift a 122-kg load. Also notice that because you pull upward, the ceiling force is actually less than the total weight - you're helping to support the load. Compare this to the previous problem where pulling downward meant the ceiling had to support more than the load's weight. This is why many pulley arrangements are designed so you pull upward, reducing structural requirements on the support.

**Answer**

(a) The tension in the rope is $$ T = 299\text{ N} $$.

(b) The ceiling must supply **897 N upward**.
