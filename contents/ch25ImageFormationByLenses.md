Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple
magnifying glass to the eye to a camera’s zoom lens. In this section, we will
use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form
images.

The word **lens** derives from the Latin word for a lentil bean, the shape of
which is similar to the convex lens in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The convex lens
shown has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its axis
cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. (The axis
is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center, as shown
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) Such a lens is called a **converging (or convex)
lens** for the converging effect it has on light rays. An expanded view of the
path of one ray through the lens is shown, to illustrate how the ray changes
direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Since the index of
refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves towards the
perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This
is in accordance with the law of refraction.) Due to the lens’s shape, light is
thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces. The point at which the rays cross is
defined to be the **focal point** F of the lens. The distance from the center of
the lens to its focal point is defined to be the **focal length** $$f $$ of the
lens. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows how a converging lens, such as that in a
magnifying glass, can converge the nearly parallel light rays from the sun to a
small spot.

![The figure on the right shows a convex lens. Three rays heading from left to right, 1, 2, and 3, are considered. Ray 2 falls on the axis and rays 1 and 3 are parallel to the axis. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point F is small f on the right side of the lens. Rays 1 and 3 after refraction converge at F on the axis. Ray 2 on the axis goes undeviated. The figure on the left shows an expanded view of refraction for ray 1. The angle of incidence is theta 1 and angle of refraction theta 2 and a dotted line is the perpendicular drawn to the surface of the lens at the point of incidence. The ray after the refraction at the second surface emerges with an angle equal to theta 1 prime with the perpendicular drawn at that point. The perpendiculars are shown as dotted lines.](../resources/Figure_25_06_01.jpg 'Rays of light entering a converging lens parallel to its axis converge at its focal point F. (Ray 2 lies on the axis of the lens.) The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the lens’s focal length ( f ) .

The magnifying glass focuses the sunlight to burn paper.](../resources/Figure_25_06_02.jpg 'Sunlight focused by a converging magnifying glass can burn paper. Light rays from the sun are nearly parallel and cross at the focal point of the lens. The more powerful the lens, the closer to the lens the rays will cross. ')
{: #Figure2}

The greater effect a lens has on light rays, the more powerful it is said to be.
For example, a powerful converging lens will focus parallel light rays closer to
itself and will have a smaller focal length than a weak lens. The light will
also focus into a smaller and more intense spot for a more powerful lens. The **power** $$P $$ of a lens is defined to be the inverse of its focal length. In
equation form, this is

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{f}. $$

 is the focal length of the lens, which must be given in meters (and not cm or mm). The power of a lens  $$P $$
 has the unit diopters (D), provided that the focal length is given in meters. That is,  $$1 \text{D}=1/\text{m} $$ ,
 or  $${1 \text{m}}^{-1} $$ .
 (Note that this power (optical power, actually) is not the same as power in watts defined in [Work, Energy, and Energy Resources](../contents/ch7WorkEnergyAndEnergyResources). It is a concept related to the effect of optical devices on light.) Optometrists prescribe common spectacles and contact lenses in units of diopters.

What is the Power of a Common Magnifying Glass?
</div>
Suppose you take a magnifying glass out on a sunny day and you find that it concentrates sunlight to a small spot 8.00 cm away from the lens. What are the focal length and power of the lens?

**Strategy**

The situation here is the same as those shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)
and [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). The Sun is so far away that the Sun’s rays are
nearly parallel when they reach Earth. The magnifying glass is a convex (or
converging) lens, focusing the nearly parallel rays of sunlight. Thus the focal
length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the spot, and its power is
the inverse of this distance (in m).

**Solution**

The focal length of the lens is the distance from the center of the lens to the
spot, given to be 8.00 cm. Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$f=8.00 cm. $$
</div>
To find the power of the lens, we must first convert the focal length to meters; then, we substitute this value into the equation for power. This gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{0.0800 \text{m}}= 12.5 D. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is a relatively powerful lens. The power of a lens in diopters should not
be confused with the familiar concept of power in watts. It is an unfortunate
fact that the word “power” is used for two completely different concepts. If you
examine a prescription for eyeglasses, you will note lens powers given in
diopters. If you examine the label on a motor, you will note energy consumption
rate given as a power in watts.

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of
light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in the figure
is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a **diverging lens**, because it
causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from its axis. In this case, the
lens has been shaped so that all light rays entering it parallel to its axis
appear to originate from the same point, $$\text{F} $$ , defined to be the focal
point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal
point is again called the focal length $$f $$ of the lens. Note that the focal
length and power of a diverging lens are defined to be negative. For example, if
the distance to $$F $$ in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) is 5.00 cm, then the focal
length is $$f= -5.00 \text{cm} $$ and the power of the lens is $$P=-20 \text{D} $$
. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in the
figure to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of
refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and be diverged.


![The figure on the top shows an expanded view of refraction for ray 1 falling on a concave lens. The angle of incidence is theta 1 and angle of refraction theta 2. The ray after the refraction at the second surface emerges with an angle equal to theta 1 prime with the perpendicular drawn at that point. Perpendiculars are shown as dotted lines. The figure at the bottom shows a concave lens. Three rays, 1, 2, and 3, are considered. Ray 2 falls on the axis and rays 1 and 3 are parallel to the axis. Rays 1 and 3 after refraction appear to come from a point F on the axis. The distance from the center of the lens to F is small f and is measured from the same side as the incident rays. Ray 2 on the axis goes undeviated.](../resources/Figure_25_06_03.jpg "Rays of light entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis are diverged, and all appear to originate at its focal point \( F \) .

As noted in the initial discussion of the law of refraction
in [The Law of Refraction](../contents/ch25TheLawOfRefraction), the paths of light rays are exactly
reversible. This means that the direction of the arrows could be reversed for
all of the rays in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) and [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). For
example, if a point light source is placed at the focal point of a convex lens,
as shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), parallel light rays emerge from the other
side.

![Three light rays coming from a light bulb filament are incident on a convex lens and the rays after refraction are rendered parallel.](../resources/Figure_25_06_04.jpg "A small light source, like a light bulb filament, placed at the focal point of a convex lens, results in parallel rays of light emerging from the other side. The paths are exactly the reverse of those shown in Figure 1. This technique is used in lighthouses and sometimes in traffic lights to produce a directional beam of light from a source that emits light in all directions. ")

### Ray Tracing and Thin Lenses

**Ray tracing** is the technique of determining or following (tracing) the paths
that light rays take. For rays passing through matter, the law of refraction is
used to trace the paths. Here we use ray tracing to help us understand the
action of lenses in situations ranging from forming images on film to magnifying
small print to correcting nearsightedness. While ray tracing for complicated
lenses, such as those found in sophisticated cameras, may require computer
techniques, there is a set of simple rules for tracing rays through thin lenses.
A **thin lens** is defined to be one whose thickness allows rays to refract, as
illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), but does not allow properties such as
dispersion and aberrations. An ideal thin lens has two refracting surfaces but
the lens is thin enough to assume that light rays bend only once. A thin
symmetrical lens has two focal points, one on either side and both at the same
distance from the lens. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) Another important
characteristic of a thin lens is that light rays through its center are
deflected by a negligible amount, as seen in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).

")
{: #Figure6}

Using paper, pencil, and a straight edge, ray tracing can accurately describe
the operation of a lens. The rules for ray tracing for thin lenses are based on
the illustrations already discussed:

1. A ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the
   focal point F of the lens on the other side. (See rays 1 and 3
   in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)
2. A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis seems to come from the
   focal point F. (See rays 1 and 3 in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)
3. A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens
   does not change direction. (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6), and see ray 2
   in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) and [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)
4. A ray entering a converging lens through its focal point exits parallel to
   its axis. (The reverse of rays 1 and 3 in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)
5. A ray that enters a diverging lens by heading toward the focal point on the
   opposite side exits parallel to the axis. (The reverse of rays 1 and 3
   in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

### Image Formation by Thin Lenses

In some circumstances, a lens forms an obvious image, such as when a movie
projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image is less
obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We will use ray
tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we will develop
equations to describe the image formation quantitatively.

Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). To find the location and size of the image formed, we
trace the paths of selected light rays originating from one point on the object,
in this case the top of the person’s head. The figure shows three rays from the
top of the object that can be traced using the ray tracing rules given above. (
Rays leave this point going in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few
with paths that are easy to trace.) The first ray is one that enters the lens
parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule
1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing
direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its
way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). The three
rays cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top
of the person’s head is located at this point. All rays that come from the same
point on the top of the person’s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at
the point shown. Rays from another point on the object, such as her belt buckle,
will also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown.
Although three rays are traced in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7), only two are necessary
to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray
tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider
the example shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) in more detail.

![First of four images shows an incident ray 1 coming from an object (a girl ) placed on the axis. After refraction, the ray passes through F on other side of the lens. Second of four images shows an incident ray 2 passing through the center without any deviation. Third of four images shows an incident ray passing through F, which after refraction goes parallel to the axis. Fourth image shows a combination of all three rays, 1, 2, and 3, incident on a convex lens; after refraction, they converge or cross at a point below the axis at some distance from F. Here the height of the object h sub o is the height of the girl above the axis and h sub i is the height of the image below the axis. The distance from the center to point F is small f. The distance from the center to the girl is d sub o and that to the image is d sub i.](../resources/Figure_25_06_07.jpg "Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced&#x2014;the three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so that their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where the rays cross. In this case, a real image&#x2014;one that can be projected on a screen&#x2014;is formed.  ")
{: #Figure7}

The image formed in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) is a **real image**, meaning that it
can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object actually
cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece
of film, or the retina of an eye, for example. [[Figure 8]](#Figure8) shows how
such an image would be projected onto film by a camera lens. This figure also
shows how a real image is projected onto the retina by the lens of an eye. Note
that the image is there whether it is projected onto a screen or not.

Real Image
</div>
The image in which light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye is called a real image.

![Figure (a) shows incident rays coming from an object (a girl) and falling on a convex lens in a camera. The rays after refraction produce an inverted, real, and diminished image on the film of the camera. Figure (b) shows the same object in front of a human eye. The rays from the object fall on the convex lens and on refraction produce a real, inverted, and diminished image on the retina of the eyeball.](../resources/Figure_25_06_08.jpg "Real images can be projected. (a) A real image of the person is projected onto film. (b) The converging nature of the multiple surfaces that make up the eye result in the projection of a real image on the retina.")
{: #Figure8}

Several important distances appear in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). We define $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ to be the object distance, the distance of an object from the
center of a lens. <strong class="term" >Image
distance </strong> $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ is defined to be the distance of the
image from the center of a lens. The height of the object and height of the
image are given the symbols $${h}_{\text{o}} $$ and $${h}_{\text{i}} $$ ,
respectively. Images that appear upright relative to the object have heights
that are positive and those that are inverted have negative heights. Using the
rules of ray tracing and making a scale drawing with paper and pencil, like that
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7), we can accurately describe the location and size of
an image. But the real benefit of ray tracing is in visualizing how images are
formed in a variety of situations. To obtain numerical information, we use a
pair of equations that can be derived from a geometric analysis of ray tracing
for thin lenses. The **thin lens equations** are

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f} $$
</div>

and

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}= m. $$
</div>

We define the ratio of image height to object height ( $${h}_{\text{i}}/{h}_{\text{o}} $$ )
to be the **magnification**  $$m $$ .
(The minus sign in the equation above will be discussed shortly.) The thin lens
equations are broadly applicable to all situations involving thin lenses (and
“thin” mirrors, as we will see later). We will explore many features of image
formation in the following worked examples.

Finding the Image of a Light Bulb Filament by Ray Tracing and by the Thin Lens Equations
</div>
A clear glass light bulb is placed 0.750 m from a convex lens having a 0.500 m focal length, as shown in [[Figure 9]](#Figure9). Use ray tracing to get an approximate location for the image. Then use the thin lens equations to calculate (a) the location of the image and (b) its magnification. Verify that ray tracing and the thin lens equations produce consistent results.

![A light bulb at d sub o equals 0.75 m is placed in front of a convex lens of f equals 0.50 meter. The convex lens produces a real, inverted, and enlarged image on a screen at d sub I equals 1.50 meters.](../resources/Figure_25_06_09.jpg "A light bulb placed 0.750 m from a lens having a 0.500 m focal length produces a real image on a poster board as discussed in the example above. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size. ")
{: #Figure9}

**Strategy and Concept**

Since the object is placed farther away from a converging lens than the focal
length of the lens, this situation is analogous to those illustrated
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) and [[Figure 8]](#Figure8). Ray tracing to scale
should produce similar results for $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ . Numerical solutions for
$${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $$m $$ can be obtained using the thin lens equations,
noting that $${d}_{\text{o}}=0.750 \text{m} and f=0.500 \text{m} $$.

**Solutions (Ray tracing)**

The ray tracing to scale in [[Figure 9]](#Figure9) shows two rays from a point
on the bulb’s filament crossing about 1.50 m on the far side of the lens. Thus
the image distance $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ is about 1.50 m. Similarly, the image
height based on ray tracing is greater than the object height by about a factor
of 2, and the image is inverted. Thus $$m $$ is about –2. The minus sign
indicates that the image is inverted.

The thin lens equations can be used to find $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ from the given
information:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f}\text{.} $$
</div>
Rearranging to isolate  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Entering known quantities gives a value for  $$1/{d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{0.500 \text{m}}-\frac{1}{0.750 \text{m}}=\frac{0.667}{\text{m}}\text{.} $$
</div>
This must be inverted to find  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{\text{i}}=\frac{\text{m}}{0.667}=1.50 \text{m}\text{.} $$
</div>
Note that another way to find  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
 is to rearrange the equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}\text{.} $$
</div>
This yields the equation for the image distance as:

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{\text{i}}=\frac{ {\text{fd}}_{\text{o}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}-f}\text{.} $$
</div>
Note that there is no inverting here.

The thin lens equations can be used to find the magnification $$m $$ , since
both $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ are known. Entering their
values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{1.50 \text{m}}{0.750 \text{m}}= -2.00. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image
is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the thin lens equations produce
consistent results. The thin lens equations give the most precise results, being
limited only by the accuracy of the given information. Ray tracing is limited by
the accuracy with which you can draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually
and visually.

Real images, such as the one considered in the previous example, are formed by
converging lenses whenever an object is farther from the lens than its focal
length. This is true for movie projectors, cameras, and the eye. We shall refer
to these as *case 1* images. A case 1 image is formed when $${d}_{\text{o}}>f $$
and $$f $$ is positive, as in [[Figure 10]](#Figure10)(a). (A summary of the
three cases or types of image formation appears at the end of this section.)

A different type of image is formed when an object, such as a person\'s face, is
held close to a convex lens. The image is upright and larger than the object, as
seen in [[Figure 10]](#Figure10)(b), and so the lens is called a magnifier. If
you slowly pull the magnifier away from the face, you will see that the
magnification steadily increases until the image begins to blur. Pulling the
magnifier even farther away produces an inverted image as seen
in [[Figure 10]](#Figure10)(a). The distance at which the image blurs, and
beyond which it inverts, is the focal length of the lens. To use a convex lens
as a magnifier, the object must be closer to the converging lens than its focal
length. This is called a *case 2* image. A case 2 image is formed when $${d}_{\text{o}}<f $$ and $$f $$ is positive.

![Figure a shows a lens forming an inverted image of a person&#x2019;s face when it is held far away from his face. Figure b shows a magnified image of the person&#x2019;s eye when viewed through a magnifying glass when the lens is placed close to the eye of the person.](../resources/Figure_25_06_10.jpg "(a) When a converging lens is held farther away from the face than the lens&#x2019;s focal length, an inverted image is formed. This is a case 1 image. Note that the image is in focus but the face is not, because the image is much closer to the camera taking this photograph than the face. (credit: DaMongMan, Flickr) (b) A magnified image of a face is produced by placing it closer to the converging lens than its focal length. This is a case 2 image. (credit: Casey Fleser, Flickr)")
{: #Figure10}

[[Figure 11]](#Figure11) uses ray tracing to show how an image is formed when an
object is held closer to a converging lens than its focal length. Rays coming
from a common point on the object continue to diverge after passing through the
lens, but all appear to originate from a point at the location of the image. The
image is on the same side of the lens as the object and is farther away from the
lens than the object. This image, like all case 2 images, cannot be projected
and, hence, is called a **virtual image**. Light rays only appear to originate
at a virtual image; they do not actually pass through that location in space. A
screen placed at the location of a virtual image will receive only diffuse light
from the object, not focused rays from the lens. Additionally, a screen placed
on the opposite side of the lens will receive rays that are still diverging, and
so no image will be projected on it. We can see the magnified image with our
eyes, because the lens of the eye converges the rays into a real image projected
on our retina. Finally, we note that a virtual image is upright and larger than

Virtual Image
</div>
An image that is on the same side of the lens as the object and cannot be projected on a screen is called a virtual image.

<div class="title">
Image Produced by a Magnifying Glass
</div>
Suppose the book page in [[Figure 11]](#Figure11) (a) is held 7.50 cm from a convex lens of focal length 10.0 cm, such as a typical magnifying glass might have. What magnification is produced?

**Strategy and Concept**

We are given that $${d}_{\text{o}}=7.50 \text{cm} $$ and $$f=10.0 \text{cm} $$ ,
so we have a situation where the object is placed closer to the lens than its
focal length. We therefore expect to get a case 2 virtual image with a positive
magnification that is greater than 1. Ray tracing produces an image like that
shown in [[Figure 11]](#Figure11), but we will use the thin lens equations to
get numerical solutions in this example.

**Solution**

To find the magnification $$m $$ , we try to use magnification equation, $$m=-d_{\text{i}}/{d}_{\text{o}} $$ . We do not have a value for $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ ,
so that we must first find the location of the image using lens equation. (The
procedure is the same as followed in the preceding example, where $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ and $$f $$ were known.) Rearranging the magnification equation to
isolate $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Entering known values, we obtain a value for  $$1/{d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{10.0 \text{cm}}-\frac{1}{7.50 \text{cm}}=\frac{ -0.0333}{\text{cm}}\text{.} $$
</div>
This must be inverted to find  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{\text{i}}=-\frac{\text{cm}}{ 0.0333}=-30.0 \text{cm}. $$
</div>
Now the thin lens equation can be used to find the magnification  $$m $$ ,
 since both  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
 and  $${d}_{\text{o}} $$
 are known. Entering their values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{- 30.0 \text{cm}}{ 7.50 \text{cm}}=4.00 . $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A number of results in this example are true of all case 2 images, as well as
being consistent with [[Figure 11]](#Figure11). Magnification is indeed
positive (as predicted), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also
greater than 1, meaning that the image is larger than the object—in this case,
by a factor of 4. Note that the image distance is negative. This means the image
is on the same side of the lens as the object. Thus the image cannot be
projected and is virtual. (Negative values of $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ occur for
virtual images.) The image is farther from the lens than the object, since the
image distance is greater in magnitude than the object distance. The location of
the image is not obvious when you look through a magnifier. In fact, since the
image is bigger than the object, you may think the image is closer than the
object. But the image is farther away, a fact that is useful in correcting
farsightedness, as we shall see in a later section.

</div>

A third type of image is formed by a diverging or concave lens. Try looking
through eyeglasses meant to correct nearsightedness. (
See [[Figure 12]](#Figure12).) You will see an image that is upright but smaller
than the object. This means that the magnification is positive but less than 1.
The ray diagram in [[Figure 13]](#Figure13) shows that the image is on the same
side of the lens as the object and, hence, cannot be projected—it is a virtual
image. Note that the image is closer to the lens than the object. This is a *
case 3* image, formed for any object by a negative focal length or diverging
lens.

Figure (c) combines both figures (a) and (b) and the dotted line and the solid line meet at a point on the left side of the lens forming a virtual image which is erect and diminished.

Image Produced by a Concave Lens
</div>
Suppose an object such as a book page is held 7.50 cm from a concave lens of focal length –10.0 cm. Such a lens could be used in eyeglasses to correct pronounced nearsightedness. What magnification is produced?

**Strategy and Concept**

This example is identical to the preceding one, except that the focal length is
negative for a concave or diverging lens. The method of solution is thus the
same, but the results are different in important ways.

**Solution**

To find the magnification $$m $$ , we must first find the image distance $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ using thin lens equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}\text{,} $$
</div>
or its alternative rearrangement

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{i}=\frac{ fd_{\text{o}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}-f}\text{.} $$
</div>
We are given that  $$f=-10.0 \text{cm} $$
 and  $${d}_{\text{o}}=7.50 \text{cm} $$ .
 Entering these yields a value for  $$1/{d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{−10.0 \text{cm}}-\frac{1}{7.50 \text{cm}}=\frac{ -0.2333}{\text{cm}}\text{.} $$
</div>
This must be inverted to find  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{\text{i}}=-\frac{\text{cm}}{ 0.2333}=-4.29 \text{cm}\text{.} $$
</div>
Or

<div class="equation" >
 $${d}_{\text{i}}=\frac{\left( 7.5\right)\left(-10\right)}{\left( 7.5-\left(-10\right)\right)}=-75/ 17.5=-4.29 \text{cm}\text{.} $$
</div>
Now the magnification equation can be used to find the magnification  $$m $$ ,
 since both  $${d}_{\text{i}} $$
 and  $${d}_{\text{o}} $$
 are known. Entering their values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{-4.29 \text{cm}}{7.50 \text{cm}}= 0.571\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images, as well as
being consistent with [[Figure 13]](#Figure13). Magnification is positive (as
predicted), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also less than 1,
meaning the image is smaller than the object—in this case, a little over half
its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side
of the lens as the object. (The image is virtual.) The image is closer to the
lens than the object, since the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the
object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through
a concave lens. In fact, since the image is smaller than the object, you may
think it is farther away. But the image is closer than the object, a fact that
is useful in correcting nearsightedness, as we shall see in a later section.

</div>

[[Table 1]](#Table1) summarizes the three types of images formed by single thin
lenses. These are referred to as case 1, 2, and 3 images. Convex (converging)
lenses can form either real or virtual images (cases 1 and 2, respectively),
whereas concave (diverging) lenses can form only virtual images (always case 3).
Real images are always inverted, but they can be either larger or smaller than
the object. For example, a slide projector forms an image larger than the slide,
whereas a camera makes an image smaller than the object being photographed.
Virtual images are always upright and cannot be projected. Virtual images are
larger than the object only in case 2, where a convex lens is used. The virtual
image produced by a concave lens is always smaller than the object—a case 3
image. We can see and photograph virtual images only by using an additional lens
to form a real image.

### Problem-Solving Strategies for Lenses
{: #Note1}

Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is
involved.

Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin lens equations, or both are to
be employed. A sketch is very useful even if ray tracing is not specifically
required by the problem. Write symbols and values on the sketch.

Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify
the unknowns).

Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as
stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to determine whether the situation
involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. While these are just names for types of
images, they have certain characteristics (given in [[Table 1]](#Table1)) that
can be of great use in solving problems.

Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray tracing rules listed near the
beginning of this section.

Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin lens equations.
These are solved in the usual manner by substituting knowns and solving for
unknowns. Several worked examples serve as guides.

Step 7. Check to see if the answer is reasonable: Does it make sense*?* If you
have identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3), you should assess whether
your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on.

We do not realize that light rays are coming from every part of the object, passing through every part of the lens, and all can be used to form the final image.

### Section Summary

* Light rays entering a converging lens parallel to its axis cross one another
  at a single point on the opposite side.
* For a converging lens, the focal point is the point at which converging light
  rays cross; for a diverging lens, the focal point is the point from which
  diverging light rays appear to originate.
* The distance from the center of the lens to its focal point is called the
  focal length $$f $$ .

* Power $$P $$ of a lens is defined to be the inverse of its focal length,
  $$P=\frac{1}{f} $$ .

* A lens that causes the light rays to bend away from its axis is called a
  diverging lens.
* Ray tracing is the technique of graphically determining the paths that light
  rays take.
* The image in which light rays from one point on the object actually cross at
  the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film,
  or the retina of an eye is called a real image.
* Thin lens equations are $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{f} $$ and $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_ $$
  {\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=m

(magnification).

- The distance of the image from the center of the lens is called image
  distance.
- An image that is on the same side of the lens as the object and cannot be
  projected on a screen is called a virtual image.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the power in diopters of a camera lens that has a 50.0 mm focal length?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship $$P = 1/f$$ where $$f$$ must be in meters and $$P$$ will be in diopters (D).

**Solution**

Convert focal length to meters:
<div class="equation">
$$f = 50.0 \text{ mm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate power:
<div class="equation">
$$P = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.0500 \text{ m}} = 20.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Answer:** The power is **20.0 diopters**.

**Discussion**

A 50 mm lens is considered a "normal" focal length for 35 mm film cameras, providing a field of view similar to human vision. The positive power indicates this is a converging lens. Camera lenses typically range from about 5 D (200 mm telephoto) to 50 D (20 mm wide-angle), with the 50 mm lens (20 D) in the middle range.

Your camera's zoom lens has an adjustable focal length ranging from 80.0 to 200 mm. What is its range of powers?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$P = 1/f$$ for both the minimum and maximum focal lengths, converting to meters first.

**Solution**

For the minimum focal length (telephoto setting):
<div class="equation">
$$f_{\text{min}} = 200 \text{ mm} = 0.200 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{min}} = \frac{1}{0.200 \text{ m}} = 5.00 \text{ D}$$
</div>

For the maximum focal length (wide-angle setting):
<div class="equation">
$$f_{\text{max}} = 80.0 \text{ mm} = 0.0800 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{0.0800 \text{ m}} = 12.5 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Answer:** The range of powers is **5.00 D to 12.5 D**.

**Discussion**

The zoom lens can vary its power from 5.00 D (telephoto, longer focal length) to 12.5 D (wide-angle, shorter focal length). This 2.5× zoom range is typical for standard camera zoom lenses. Note that higher power (shorter focal length) provides a wider field of view, while lower power (longer focal length) magnifies distant objects. This is a 80-200mm zoom, which in 35mm camera terms goes from a moderate telephoto to a longer telephoto focal length.

What is the focal length of 1.75 D reading glasses found on the rack in a pharmacy?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$f = 1/P$$ to find focal length from power.

**Solution**

**Answer:** The focal length is **57.1 cm** or **0.571 m**.

**Discussion**

Reading glasses with +1.75 D are for people with mild presbyopia (age-related farsightedness). The relatively long focal length (57 cm) means these glasses help bring close objects (like books or phones) into focus at comfortable reading distances. The positive power indicates these are converging lenses that help the eye focus on nearby objects.

**Strategy**

Use $$f = 1/P$$ to find focal length from power. The negative power indicates diverging (concave) lenses.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{-4.50 \text{ D}} = -0.222 \text{ m} = -22.2 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Answer:** The focal length is **−0.222 m** or **−22.2 cm**.

**Discussion**

The negative focal length confirms these are diverging (concave) lenses used to correct myopia (nearsightedness). People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly but have difficulty focusing on distant objects because their eye's lens system is too powerful, focusing light in front of the retina. The diverging lenses spread the light slightly before it enters the eye, moving the focal point back onto the retina. A −4.50 D prescription represents moderate myopia. The relatively short focal length (22.2 cm) means these lenses will noticeably reduce the apparent size of objects when looking through them.

How far from the lens must the film in a camera be, if the lens has a 35.0 mm focal length and is being used to photograph a flower 75.0 cm away? Explicitly show how you follow the steps in the Problem-Solving Strategy for lenses.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is a case 1 image (real, inverted) since the object is farther from the lens than the focal length. We use the thin lens equation $$\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}$$ to find $$d_i$$.

**Solution**

**Step 1-2:** Image formation by a lens is involved. We'll use the thin lens equation.

**Step 3:** We need to find $$d_i$$ (image distance/film distance).

**Step 4:** Given: $$f = 35.0 \text{ mm} = 3.50 \text{ cm}$$, $$d_o = 75.0 \text{ cm}$$

**Step 5:** (Ray tracing not required)

**Step 6:** Using the thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{3.50 \text{ cm}} - \frac{1}{75.0 \text{ cm}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = 0.2857 - 0.0133 = 0.2724 \text{ cm}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d_i = \frac{1}{0.2724} = 3.67 \text{ cm} = 36.7 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**Step 7:** This is reasonable—the film must be slightly farther from the lens than the focal length when photographing an object at finite distance. The image distance (36.7 mm) is only slightly more than the focal length (35.0 mm), which makes sense for an object relatively far away.

**Answer:** The film must be **36.7 mm** from the lens.

**Discussion**

Notice that even though the flower is 750 mm away (more than 21 times the focal length), the film needs to be only 1.7 mm beyond the focal point. This demonstrates why camera focusing mechanisms need only small adjustments for objects at different distances—the lens-to-film distance doesn't change much as object distance varies.

<div class="equation">
$$h_i = m \cdot h_o = -0.0169 \times 1750 \text{ mm} = -29.6 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

Taking the absolute value, 29.6 mm of the 36.0 mm film height is used. Fraction:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{29.6}{36.0} = 0.822 = 82.2\%$$
</div>

Alternatively, if the entire person (1750 mm) were to fit on the 36.0 mm film:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{29.6 \text{ mm}}{1750 \text{ mm}} \times \frac{1750 \text{ mm}}{36.0 \text{ mm}} = \frac{29.6}{36.0} = 0.822$$
</div>

Actually, the question asks what fraction of the person fits:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Fraction of person} = \frac{36.0 \text{ mm}}{29.6 \text{ mm}} = 1.22$$
</div>

This means the entire person (100%) plus 22% more would fit, so the entire person fits comfortably.

**(c)** This is very reasonable. With a 50 mm "normal" lens and the subject 3 m away, getting a full-body portrait that uses about 82% of the frame height is typical. This provides good composition with a little space above the head and below the feet. Professional photographers often aim for this kind of framing for full-body portraits, as it avoids cropping body parts while not wasting too much of the frame.

**Answers:** (a) **50.8 mm**, (b) **The entire 1.75 m person fits, using 82.2% of the film height**, (c) Very reasonable for portrait photography.

**Discussion**

The film needs to be only slightly farther from the lens (50.8 mm) than the focal length (50.0 mm) because the object is relatively far away (60 times the focal length). This small adjustment is why cameras need focusing mechanisms. The 50 mm lens at 3 m gives good perspective for portraits without distortion, which is why 50 mm is considered the "normal" focal length for 35 mm film cameras.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

**(a)** Use the thin lens equation with $$f = 50.0 \text{ mm}$$ and $$d_i = 51.0 \text{ mm}$$ to find $$d_o$$. **(b)** Use the magnification equation.

**Solution**

**(a)** From the thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{50.0 \text{ mm}} - \frac{1}{51.0 \text{ mm}}$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_o} = 0.0200 - 0.0196 = 0.000392 \text{ mm}^{-1}$$

<div class="equation">
$$d_o = 2550 \text{ mm} = 2.55 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**(b)** The magnification is:
<div class="equation">
$$m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = -\frac{51.0 \text{ mm}}{2550 \text{ mm}} = -0.0200$$
</div>

The object height is:
<div class="equation">
$$h_o = \frac{h_i}{m} = \frac{-20.0 \text{ mm}}{-0.0200} = 1000 \text{ mm} = 1.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Answers:** (a) **2.55 m**, (b) **1.00 m** (assuming the image is inverted)

**Discussion**

When the film is moved just 1.0 mm farther from the lens (from 50.0 mm to 51.0 mm), the object in focus moves from infinity to 2.55 m. This demonstrates that small adjustments in lens-to-film distance allow focusing on objects at finite distances. The magnification of −0.0200 means the image is 1/50th the size of the object and inverted, which is typical for camera photography. A 1.00 m tall object creating a 2.00 cm image on film is very reasonable for portrait or documentary photography.

What magnification will be produced by a lens of power –4.00 D (such as might be used to correct myopia) if an object is held 25.0 cm away?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First find the focal length from $$f = 1/P$$, then use the thin lens equation to find $$d_i$$, and finally calculate magnification from $$m = -d_i/d_o$$.

**Solution**

Focal length:
<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{-4.00 \text{ D}} = -0.250 \text{ m} = -25.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

Image distance from thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{-25.0 \text{ cm}} - \frac{1}{25.0 \text{ cm}}$$

$$\frac{1}{d_i} = -0.0400 - 0.0400 = -0.0800 \text{ cm}^{-1}$$

</div>

Magnification:
<div class="equation">
$$m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = -\frac{-12.5 \text{ cm}}{25.0 \text{ cm}} = +0.500$$
</div>

**Answer:** The magnification is **+0.500** or **+0.50**.

**Discussion**

The positive magnification indicates an upright virtual image, and the magnitude less than 1 means the image is smaller than the object (half the size). This is characteristic of diverging lenses (case 3 images). When you hold an object 25 cm from a −4.00 D lens (used for myopia correction), you see a virtual image that appears half the size and 12.5 cm from the lens (on the same side as the object). This is why nearsighted people's eyes appear smaller when viewed through their glasses—the diverging lenses create reduced images.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

**(a)** Use the thin lens equation. Since the object is very far away ($$d_o \gg f$$), the image will be very close to the focal point. **(b)** Use magnification equation.

**Solution**

**(a)** From the thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{200 \text{ mm}} - \frac{1}{10.0 \times 10^6 \text{ mm}}$$

</div>

Image height:
<div class="equation">

**Answers:** (a) **200 mm** (essentially at the focal point), (b) **20.0 mm** (inverted)

**Discussion**

When photographing distant objects (10 km is 50,000 times the focal length), the image forms essentially at the focal point. This is why landscape photographers rarely need to adjust focus when photographing distant scenes—everything from about 30 m to infinity focuses at nearly the same point. The 1000 m cliff creates only a 20 mm image on the film/sensor, demonstrating why telephoto lenses are needed for distant subjects. Even with a 200 mm telephoto, distant mountains create relatively small images.

Combine thin lens equations to show that the magnification for a thin lens is determined by its focal length and the object distance and is given by  $$m=f/\left(f-{d}_{\text{o}}\right) $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Start with the magnification equation $$m = -d_i/d_o$$ and the thin lens equation $$\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}$$. Eliminate $$d_i$$ to express $$m$$ in terms of $$f$$ and $$d_o$$ only.

**Solution**

From the thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}$$
</div>

Finding a common denominator:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{d_o - f}{fd_o}$$
</div>

Inverting:
<div class="equation">
$$d_i = \frac{fd_o}{d_o - f}$$
</div>

Substituting into the magnification equation:
<div class="equation">
$$m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = -\frac{1}{d_o} \cdot \frac{fd_o}{d_o - f}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$m = -\frac{f}{d_o - f}$$
</div>

Multiplying numerator and denominator by −1:
<div class="equation">
$$m = \frac{f}{f - d_o}$$
</div>

Thus we have shown that $$m = \frac{f}{f - d_o}$$.

**Discussion**

This alternative form of the magnification equation is useful because it directly shows how magnification depends on the relationship between focal length and object distance:

- When $$d_o > f$$ (case 1): $$f - d_o < 0$$, so $$m < 0$$ (inverted real image)
- When $$d_o < f$$ (case 2): $$f - d_o > 0$$, so $$m > 0$$ (upright virtual image)
- As $$d_o \to f$$: $$m \to \pm \infty$$ (image moves to infinity)
- As $$d_o \to \infty$$: $$m \to 0$$ (very small image at focal point)

This form makes it easy to calculate magnification without first finding the image distance.
