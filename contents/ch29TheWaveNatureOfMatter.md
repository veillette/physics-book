### De Broglie Wavelength

In 1923 a French physics graduate student named Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie (
1892–1987) made a radical proposal based on the hope that nature is symmetric.
If EM radiation has both particle and wave properties, then nature would be
symmetric if matter also had both particle and wave properties. If what we once
thought of as an unequivocal wave (EM radiation) is also a particle, then what
we think of as an unequivocal particle (matter) may also be a wave. De Broglie’s
suggestion, made as part of his doctoral thesis, was so radical that it was
greeted with some skepticism. A copy of his thesis was sent to Einstein, who
said it was not only probably correct, but that it might be of fundamental
importance. With the support of Einstein and a few other prominent physicists,
de Broglie was awarded his doctorate.

De Broglie took both relativity and quantum mechanics into account to develop
the proposal that **all particles have a wavelength**, given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =\frac{h}{p} \left(\text{ matter and photons }\right), $$
</div>

where $$h $$ is Planck’s constant and $$p $$ is momentum. This is defined to be
the **de Broglie wavelength**. (Note that we already have this for photons, from
the equation $$p=h/\lambda $$ .)
The hallmark of a wave is interference. If matter is a wave, then it must
exhibit constructive and destructive interference. Why isn’t this ordinarily
observed? The answer is that in order to see significant interference effects, a
wave must interact with an object about the same size as its wavelength. Since
$$h $$ is very small, $$\lambda $$ is also small, especially for macroscopic
objects. A 3-kg bowling ball moving at 10 m/s, for example, has

<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =h/p=\left( 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{J·s}\right)/\left[ \left(3 \text{kg}\right)\left(10 \text{m/s}\right)\right]  =2 \times 10^{-35} \text{m} \text{.}  $$
</div>

This means that to see its wave characteristics, the bowling ball would have to
interact with something about $$10^{-35} \text{m} $$ in size—far smaller than
anything known. When waves interact with objects much larger than their
wavelength, they show negligible interference effects and move in straight
lines (such as light rays in geometric optics). To get easily observed
interference effects from particles of matter, the longest wavelength and hence
smallest mass possible would be useful. Therefore, this effect was first
observed with electrons.

American physicists Clinton J. Davisson and Lester H. Germer in 1925 and,
independently, British physicist G. P. Thomson (son of J. J. Thomson, discoverer
of the electron) in 1926 scattered electrons from crystals and found diffraction
patterns. These patterns are exactly consistent with interference of electrons
having the de Broglie wavelength and are somewhat analogous to light interacting
with a diffraction grating. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

Connections: Waves
</div>
All microscopic particles, whether massless, like photons, or having mass, like electrons, have wave properties. The relationship between momentum and wavelength is fundamental for all particles.

</div>

De Broglie’s proposal of a wave nature for all particles initiated a remarkably
productive era in which the foundations for quantum mechanics were laid. In
1926, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) published four papers
in which the wave nature of particles was treated explicitly with wave
equations. At the same time, many others began important work. Among them was
German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) who, among many other
contributions to quantum mechanics, formulated a mathematical treatment of the
wave nature of matter that used matrices rather than wave equations. We will
deal with some specifics in later sections, but it is worth noting that de
Broglie’s work was a watershed for the development of quantum mechanics. De
Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929 for his vision, as were Davisson and
G. P. Thomson in 1937 for their experimental verification of de Broglie’s
hypothesis.

Electron Wavelength versus Velocity and Energy
</div>
For an electron having a de Broglie wavelength of 0.167 nm (appropriate for interacting with crystal lattice structures that are about this size): (a) Calculate the electron’s velocity, assuming it is nonrelativistic. (b) Calculate the electron’s kinetic energy in eV.

**Strategy**

For part (a), since the de Broglie wavelength is given, the electron’s velocity
can be obtained from $$\lambda =h/p $$ by using the nonrelativistic formula for
momentum, $$p= mv \text{.} $$ For part (b), once $$v $$ is obtained (and it has
been verified that $$v $$ is nonrelativistic), the classical kinetic energy is
simply $$\left(1/2\right)mv^{2}\text{.} $$
**Solution for (a)**

Substituting the nonrelativistic formula for momentum ( $$p=mv $$ )
into the de Broglie wavelength gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}. $$
</div>
Solving for  $$v $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{h}{m\lambda }. $$
</div>
Substituting known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{ 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{J}\cdot \text{s}}{\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right)\left( 0.167 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}\right)}=4.36 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s}. $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

While fast compared with a car, this electron’s speed is not highly
relativistic, and so we can comfortably use the classical formula to find the
electron’s kinetic energy and convert it to eV as requested.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\text{KE}& =& \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\ & =& \frac{1}{2}\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right) {\left( 4.36 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}\\ & =& \left( 86.4 \times 10^{-18} \text{J} \right) \left(\frac{1 \text{eV}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}}\right)\\ & =& 54.0 \text{eV}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This low energy means that these 0.167-nm electrons could be obtained by
accelerating them through a 54.0-V electrostatic potential, an easy task. The
results also confirm the assumption that the electrons are nonrelativistic,
since their velocity is just over 1% of the speed of light and the kinetic
energy is about 0.01% of the rest energy of an electron (0.511 MeV). If the
electrons had turned out to be relativistic, we would have had to use more
involved calculations employing relativistic formulas.

### Electron Microscopes

One consequence or use of the wave nature of matter is found in the electron
microscope. As we have discussed, there is a limit to the detail observed with
any probe having a wavelength. Resolution, or observable detail, is limited to
about one wavelength. Since a potential of only 54 V can produce electrons with
sub-nanometer wavelengths, it is easy to get electrons with much smaller
wavelengths than those of visible light (hundreds of nanometers). Electron
microscopes can, thus, be constructed to detect much smaller details than
optical microscopes. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

There are basically two types of electron microscopes. The transmission electron
microscope (TEM) accelerates electrons that are emitted from a hot filament (the
cathode). The beam is broadened and then passes through the sample. A magnetic
lens focuses the beam image onto a fluorescent screen, a photographic plate,
or (most probably) a CCD (light sensitive camera), from which it is transferred
to a computer. The TEM is similar to the optical microscope, but it requires a
thin sample examined in a vacuum. However it can resolve details as small as 0.1
nm ( $$ 10^{-10} m $$ ), providing magnifications of 100 million times the size
of the original object. The TEM has allowed us to see individual atoms and
structure of cell nuclei.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides images by using secondary
electrons produced by the primary beam interacting with the surface of the
sample (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). The SEM also uses magnetic lenses to focus
the beam onto the sample. However, it moves the beam around electrically to
“scan” the sample in the *x* and *y* directions. A CCD detector is used to
process the data for each electron position, producing images like the one at
the beginning of this chapter. The SEM has the advantage of not requiring a thin
sample and of providing a 3-D view. However, its resolution is about ten times
less than a TEM.

![Figure a shows a schematic of an electron microscope. Figure b shows an image of a shark tooth.](../resources/Figure_29_06_02a.jpg "Schematic of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (a) used to observe small details, such as those seen in this image of a tooth of a Himipristis, a type of shark (b).

{ #Figure2}

Electrons were the first particles with mass to be directly confirmed to have
the wavelength proposed by de Broglie. Subsequently, protons, helium nuclei,
neutrons, and many others have been observed to exhibit interference when they
interact with objects having sizes similar to their de Broglie wavelength. The
de Broglie wavelength for massless particles was well established in the 1920s
for photons, and it has since been observed that all massless particles have a
de Broglie wavelength $$\lambda =h/p. $$ The wave nature of all particles is a
universal characteristic of nature. We shall see in following sections that
implications of the de Broglie wavelength include the quantization of energy in
atoms and molecules, and an alteration of our basic view of nature on the
microscopic scale. The next section, for example, shows that there are limits to
the precision with which we may make predictions, regardless of how hard we try.
There are even limits to the precision with which we may measure an object’s
location or energy.

Making Connections: A Submicroscopic Diffraction Grating
</div>
The wave nature of matter allows it to exhibit all the characteristics of other, more familiar, waves. Diffraction gratings, for example, produce diffraction patterns for light that depend on grating spacing and the wavelength of the light. This effect, as with most wave phenomena, is most pronounced when the wave interacts with objects having a size similar to its wavelength. For gratings, this is the spacing between multiple slits.) When electrons interact with a system having a spacing similar to the electron wavelength, they show the same types of interference patterns as light does for diffraction gratings, as shown at top left in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

Atoms are spaced at regular intervals in a crystal as parallel planes, as shown
in the bottom part of [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). The spacings between these planes
act like the openings in a diffraction grating. At certain incident angles, the
paths of electrons scattering from successive planes differ by one wavelength
and, thus, interfere constructively. At other angles, the path length
differences are not an integral wavelength, and there is partial to total
destructive interference. This type of scattering from a large crystal with
well-defined lattice planes can produce dramatic interference patterns. It is
called **Bragg reflection**, **for the father-and-son team who first explored
and analyzed it in some detail. The expanded view also shows the path-length
differences and indicates how these depend on incident angle $$\theta $$ in a
manner similar to the diffraction patterns for X-rays reflecting from a crystal.

![An electron beam is striking at an angle theta on a crystal and the reflected rays are detected by a detector. A magnified view of the crystal is also shown with two rays of electrons striking the various layers of crystal at an angle theta and reflected back. A graph is shown of intensity variation versus theta. Intensity is along the y axis and theta is along the x axis.The shape of the curve is like a wave and each subsequent peak diminishes as we move out the x axis.](../resources/Figure_29_06_03a.jpg "The diffraction pattern at top left is produced by scattering electrons from a crystal and is graphed as a function of incident angle relative to the regular array of atoms in a crystal, as shown at bottom. Electrons scattering from the second layer of atoms travel farther than those scattered from the top layer. If the path length difference (PLD) is an integral wavelength, there is constructive interference.")
{ #Figure3}

Let us take the spacing between parallel planes of atoms in the crystal to be
$$d $$ . As mentioned, if the path length difference (PLD) for the electrons is
a whole number of wavelengths, there will be constructive interference—that is,
$$\text{PLD}=\mathrm{n\lambda }\left(n=1, 2, 3,\dots \right) $$ . Because
$$\text{AB}=\text{BC}=d \sin \theta \text{,} $$ we have constructive
interference when $$\mathrm{n\lambda }=2d \sin \mathrm{\theta .} $$ This
relationship is called the *Bragg equation* and applies not only to electrons
but also to X-rays.

The wavelength of matter is a submicroscopic characteristic that explains a
macroscopic phenomenon such as Bragg reflection. Similarly, the wavelength of
light is a submicroscopic characteristic that explains the macroscopic
phenomenon of diffraction patterns.

### Section Summary

* Particles of matter also have a wavelength, called the de Broglie wavelength,
  given by $$\lambda =\frac{h}{p} $$ , where $$p $$ is momentum.
* Matter is found to have the same **interference characteristics** as any other
  wave.
