* Discuss the pattern obtained from diffraction grating.

</div>

An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly
spaced parallel slits, called a **diffraction grating**. An interference pattern
is created that is very similar to the one formed by a double slit (
see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by
scratching glass with a sharp tool in a number of precisely positioned parallel
lines, with the untouched regions acting like slits. These can be
photographically mass produced rather cheaply. Diffraction gratings work both
for transmission of light, as in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), and for reflection of
light, as on butterfly wings and the Australian opal in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)
or the CD pictured in the opening photograph of this
chapter, [[Figure 1]](../contents/ch27WaveOptics#Figure1). In addition to their use
as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic
dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the
fact that they form a sharper pattern than double slits do. That is, their
bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are
darker. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper
pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds.
Tiny, finger-like structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings,
producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely
due to their pigmentation. This is called iridescence.

![The upper graph, which is labeled double slit, shows a smooth curve similar to a sine curve that is shifted up so that its minimum value is zero. Three peaks are shown: the middle peak is labeled m equals zero and the left and right peaks are labeled m equals one. The lower graph, which is labeled grating, is aligned under the upper graph and also shows three peaks, with each peak aligned directly underneath the peaks in the upper graph. These three peaks are also labeled m equals zero or one, as in the upper graph. However, the peaks in the lower graph are much narrower and there are lots of small peaks appearing between large peaks.](../resources/Figure_27_04_03.jpg 'Idealized graphs of the intensity of light passing through a double slit (a) and a diffraction grating (b) for monochromatic light. Maxima can be produced at the same angles, but those for the diffraction grating are narrower and hence sharper. The maxima become narrower and the regions between darker as the number of slits is increased.')
{: #Figure3}

The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double
slit (see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). As we know from our discussion of double
slits in [Young\'s Double Slit Experiment](../contents/ch27YoungsDoubleSlitExperiment), light is diffracted by each
slit and spreads out after passing through. Rays traveling in the same
direction (at an angle $$\theta $$ relative to the incident direction) are shown
in the figure. Each of these rays travels a different distance to a common point
on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of
phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths
traveled. As seen in the figure, each ray travels a distance $$d\sin \theta $$
different from that of its neighbor, where $$d $$ is the distance between slits.
If this distance equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive
in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the
condition necessary to obtain **constructive interference for a diffraction
grating** is

<div class="equation" >
 $$d \sin \theta =m \lambda, \text{ for } m=0 \text{,} 1 \text{,} -1 \text{,} 2 \text{,} -2 \text{,}\dots \text{(constructive),} $$
</div>

where $$d $$ is the distance between slits in the grating, $$\lambda $$ is the
wavelength of light, and $$m $$ is the order of the maximum. Note that this is
exactly the same equation as for double slits separated by $$d $$ . However, the
slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing
fewer maxima at larger angles.

![The figure shows a schematic of a diffraction grating, which is represented by a vertical black line into which are cut five small gaps. The gaps are evenly spaced a distance d apart. From the left five rays arrive, with one ray arriving at each gap. To the right of the line with the gaps the rays all point down and to the right at an angle theta below the horizontal. At each gap a triangle is formed where the hypotenuse is length d, one angle is theta, and the side opposite theta is labeled delta l. At the top is written delta l equals d sine theta.](../resources/Figure_27_04_04.jpg 'Diffraction grating showing light rays from each slit traveling in the same direction. Each ray travels a different distance to reach a common point on a screen (not shown). Each ray travels a distance d( d\\sin \\theta ) different from that of its neighbor.')

Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of
monochromators used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths
from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to
specifically analyze a wavelength emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a
biopsy sample or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a
selected frequency of light. Another vital use is in optical fiber technologies
where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific
wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings are available for selecting
specific wavelengths for such use.

Take-Home Experiment: Rainbows on a CD
</div>
The spacing  $$d $$
 of the grooves in a CD or DVD can be well determined by using a laser and the equation  $$d \sin \theta =m \lambda, \text{ for } m=0 \text{,} 1 \text{,} -1 \text{,} 2 \text{,} -2 \text{,}\dots  $$ .
 However, we can still make a good estimate of this spacing by using white light and the rainbow of colors that comes from the interference. Reflect sunlight from a CD onto a wall and use your best judgment of the location of a strongly diffracted color to find the separation  $$d $$.

Calculating Typical Diffraction Grating Effects
</div>
Diffraction gratings with 10 000 lines per centimeter are readily available. Suppose you have one, and you send a beam of white light through it to a screen 2.00 m away. (a) Find the angles for the first-order diffraction of the shortest and longest wavelengths of visible light (380 and 760 nm). (b) What is the distance between the ends of the rainbow of visible light produced on the screen for first-order interference? (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).)

![The image shows a vertical black bar at the left labeled grating. From the midpoint of this bar four lines fan out to the right, with two lines angled above the horizontal centerline and two lines angled symmetrically below the horizontal centerline. These four lines hit a vertical black line to the right that is labeled screen. On the screen between the two upper lines is a rainbow region, with violet nearer the centerline and red farther from the centerline. The same is true for the two lower lines, except that they are below the centerline instead of above. The distance from the centerline to the upper violet zone is labeled y sub v equals question mark and the distance from the centerline to the upper red zone is labeled y sub r equals question mark. The angle between the centerline and the line leading to the upper violet zone is labeled theta V equals question mark and the angle between the line leading to the upper red zone is labeled theta R equals question mark. The distance between the grating and the screen is labeled x equals two point zero zero meters.](../resources/Figure_27_04_05.jpg 'The diffraction grating considered in this example produces a rainbow of colors on a screen a distance ( x=2.00m ) from the grating. The distances along the screen are measured perpendicular to the ( x ) -direction. In other words, the rainbow pattern extends out of the page.')
{: #Figure5}

**Strategy**

The angles can be found using the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$d \sin \theta =m \lambda \left( \text{ for } m=0 \text{,} 1 \text{,} -1 \text{,} 2 \text{,} -2 \text{,} \dots \right) $$
</div>
once a value for the slit spacing  $$d $$
 has been determined. Since there are 10 000 lines per centimeter, each line is separated by  $$1/10 000 $$
 of a centimeter. Once the angles are found, the distances along the screen can be found using simple trigonometry.

**Solution for (a)**

The distance between slits is $$d=\left(1 cm\right)/10 000= 1.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{cm} $$ or $$ 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{m} $$ . Let us call the two angles
$${\theta }_{\text{V}} $$ for violet (380 nm) and $${\theta }_{\text{R}} $$ for
red (760 nm). Solving the equation $$d\sin {\theta }_{\text{V}}=\mathrm{m\lambda } $$ for $$\sin {\theta }_{\text{V}} $$ ,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{\text{V}}=\frac{ m\lambda_{\text{V}}}{d}\text{,} $$
</div>
where  $$m=1 $$
 for first order and  $${\lambda }_{\text{V}}=380 \text{nm}= 3.80 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m} $$ .
 Substituting these values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{\text{V}}=\frac{ 3.80 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m}}{ 1.00 \times 10^{-6}  \text{m}}=0.380\text{.} $$
</div>
Thus the angle  $${\theta }_{\text{V}} $$  is

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{\text{V}}={\sin}^{-1}  0.380= 22.33º. $$
</div>
Similarly,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{\text{R}}=\frac{ 7.60 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m}}{ 1.00 \times 10^{-6}  \text{m}}. $$
</div>
Thus the angle  $${\theta }_{\text{R}} $$  is

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{\text{R}}={\sin}^{-1}  0.760=49.46 \text{º.} $$
</div>
Notice that in both equations, we reported the results of these intermediate calculations to four significant figures to use with the calculation in part (b).

**Solution for (b)**

The distances on the screen are labeled $${y}_{\text{V}} $$ and $${y}_{\text{R}} $$ in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). Noting that $$\tan \theta =y/x $$ , we can solve
for $${y}_{\text{V}} $$ and $${y}_{\text{R}} $$ . That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $${y}_{\text{V}}=x \tan {\theta }_{\text{V}}=\left(2.00 m\right)\left(\tan 22.33\text{º}\right)=0.815 \text{m} $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation" >
 $${y}_{\text{R}}=x \tan {\theta }_{\text{R}}=\left(2.00 \text{m}\right)\left(\tan 49.46\text{º}\right)=2.338 \text{m} \text{.}  $$
</div>
The distance between them is therefore

<div class="equation" >
 $${y}_{\text{R}}-{y}_{\text{V}}=1.52 m. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The large distance between the red and violet ends of the rainbow produced from
the white light indicates the potential this diffraction grating has as a
spectroscopic tool. The more it can spread out the wavelengths (greater
dispersion), the more detail can be seen in a spectrum. This depends on the
quality of the diffraction grating—it must be very precisely made in addition to
having closely spaced lines.

</div>

### Section Summary

- A diffraction grating is a large collection of evenly spaced parallel slits
  that produces an interference pattern similar to but sharper than that of a
  double slit.
- There is constructive interference for a diffraction grating when $$d \sin \theta =m \lambda \left( \text{ for } m=0 \text{,} 1 \text{,} -1 \text{,} 2 \text{,} -2 \text{,} \dots \right) $$ , where $$d $$ is the distance between
  slits in the grating, $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength of light, and $$m $$ is
  the order of the maximum.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A diffraction grating has 2000 lines per centimeter. At what angle will the first-order maximum be for 520-nm-wavelength green light?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a diffraction grating, maxima occur at angles satisfying $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$, where d is the spacing between adjacent slits (grating constant), m is the order, and λ is the wavelength. First, calculate d from the line density, then solve for θ with m = 1.

**Solution**

Given:
- Line density: 2000 lines/cm
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 520 \text{ nm} = 520 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- Order: $$m = 1$$ (first-order maximum)

Calculate the grating constant (slit separation):

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{2000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{2000} = 5.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

For the first-order maximum:

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d} = \frac{(1)(520 \times 10^{-9})}{5.00 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{520 \times 10^{-9}}{5.00 \times 10^{-6}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = 0.104$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \arcsin(0.104) = 5.97°$$
</div>

**The first-order maximum for 520-nm green light occurs at 5.97°.**

**Discussion**

The small angle (5.97°) for the first-order maximum indicates that the grating constant (5.00 μm) is about 10 times the wavelength (520 nm). Diffraction gratings with 2000 lines/cm are relatively coarse gratings. Finer gratings (e.g., 10,000 lines/cm) would produce larger diffraction angles and better spectral separation. The green wavelength (520 nm) falls in the middle of the visible spectrum. Higher orders (m = 2, 3, ...) would appear at larger angles: the second order at about 11.96° and the third at about 18.05°.

</div>

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Find the angle for the third-order maximum for 580-nm-wavelength yellow light falling on a diffraction grating having 1500 lines per centimeter.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a diffraction grating, we use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ where d is the distance between lines. First, find d from the line density, then solve for θ with m = 3.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 580 \text{ nm} = 580 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- Line density = 1500 lines/cm
- $$m = 3$$ (third-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the distance between lines**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{1500 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{1500} = 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the angle**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d} = \frac{3 \times 580 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{1740 \times 10^{-9}}{6.67 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.261$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.261) = 15.1°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The third-order maximum appears at 15.1°. With a grating spacing of 6.67 μm (about 11.5 wavelengths), this grating can produce several orders of maxima. We can check: the maximum order would be m_max = d/λ = 6.67/0.580 ≈ 11.5, so up to 11 orders are theoretically possible (though higher orders become very dim and widely separated).

How many lines per centimeter are there on a diffraction grating that gives a first-order maximum for 470-nm blue light at an angle of  $$ 25.0º $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ to find the grating spacing d, then calculate the number of lines per centimeter as N = 1/d.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 470 \text{ nm} = 470 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$\theta = 25.0°$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{(1)(470 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{\sin 25.0°}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{470 \times 10^{-9}}{0.4226} = 1.112 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the number of lines per centimeter**

<div class="equation">
$$N = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{d} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{1.112 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 8.99 \times 10^{3} \text{ lines/cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

A grating with approximately 9000 lines/cm is a moderately fine diffraction grating. This spacing of about 1.11 μm (about 2.4 wavelengths of blue light) produces the first-order maximum at 25.0°, which is a convenient angle for observation. This is close to commercial gratings often available with 5000-10,000 lines/cm. Higher orders would appear at larger angles: the second order at about 57.1° and the third order at about 80.8°, with a maximum possible order of m_max = d/λ ≈ 2.4, meaning only orders 0, 1, and 2 would be fully observable.

What is the distance between lines on a diffraction grating that produces a second-order maximum for 760-nm red light at an angle of  $$ 60.0º $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 2 (second-order) to solve for the line spacing d.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 760 \text{ nm} = 760 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$\theta = 60.0°$$
- $$m = 2$$ (second-order maximum)

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{2 \times 760 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{\sin 60.0°}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1520 \times 10^{-9}}{0.8660} = 1.76 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.76 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The line spacing of 1.76 μm is very small - just over twice the wavelength of red light. This close spacing is necessary to produce the second-order maximum at the relatively large angle of 60°.

We can verify this makes sense: if the second-order maximum is at 60°, the first-order would be at θ₁ where sin θ₁ = (1)(760)/(1.76 × 10³) = 0.432, giving θ₁ = 25.6°. This seems reasonable.

For this grating, the maximum order observable would be: m_max = d/λ = 1.76/0.76 ≈ 2.3, so only second-order maxima (and possibly a dim third-order) would be observable before reaching 90°.

Calculate the wavelength of light that has its second-order maximum at  $$ 45.0º $$

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 2 (second-order) to solve for the wavelength λ. First, find the grating spacing d from the line density.

**Solution**

Given:
- Line density: 5000 lines/cm
- $$\theta = 45.0°$$
- $$m = 2$$ (second-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{5000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{5000} = 2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the wavelength**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{d \sin \theta}{m} = \frac{(2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}) \sin 45.0°}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{(2.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.7071)}{2} = \frac{1.414 \times 10^{-6}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = 7.07 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 707 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The wavelength of 707 nm falls in the red region of the visible spectrum (near the long-wavelength end). This is close to deep red light. The second-order maximum appears at 45.0°, which is a reasonably large angle, making it easy to observe and measure.

We can verify this is reasonable: the first-order maximum would appear at an angle where sin θ₁ = λ/d = 707/2000 = 0.354, giving θ₁ = 20.7°. The third-order would be at sin θ₃ = 3λ/d = 2121/2000 = 1.06 > 1, which is impossible, so no third-order maximum exists. This grating can show at most the zeroth, first, and second orders for this wavelength.

Following the Problem-Solving Strategies for Wave Optics:

**Step 1:** This involves a diffraction grating.

**For each angle, calculate λ using** $$\lambda = \frac{d \sin \theta}{m}$$ with m = 1:

**Angle 1: θ = 24.2°**
<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_1 = d \sin \theta = (1.00 \times 10^{-6}) \sin 24.2° = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.4101) = 410 \text{ nm (violet)}$$
</div>

**Angle 2: θ = 25.7°**
<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_2 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6}) \sin 25.7° = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.4337) = 434 \text{ nm (violet-blue)}$$

**Angle 4: θ = 41.0°**
<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_4 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6}) \sin 41.0° = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.6561) = 656 \text{ nm (red)}$$
</div>

**Step 6:** All results are in the visible range (380-760 nm), which is reasonable for hydrogen emission lines.

**Discussion**

These wavelengths correspond to prominent lines in the hydrogen Balmer series:
- **410 nm** (H-delta): violet
- **434 nm** (H-gamma): violet-blue
- **486 nm** (H-beta): blue-green
- **656 nm** (H-alpha): red

The H-alpha line at 656 nm is the brightest and most famous line in the visible hydrogen spectrum. These emission lines result from electrons transitioning from higher energy levels (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) down to n = 2. This spectral "fingerprint" is characteristic of hydrogen and is observed in stars, nebulae, and laboratory hydrogen discharge tubes. The precision of diffraction gratings makes them invaluable tools for spectroscopy and identifying elements.

(c) Discuss the relationship between integral reductions in lines per centimeter and the new angles of various order maxima.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the four hydrogen wavelengths from the previous problem (410, 434, 486, and 656 nm) with the new grating. For part (a), find first-order angles with the 5000 lines/cm grating. For part (b), find second-order angles. For part (c), compare how changing the grating spacing by a factor affects the angles.

**Solution**

The four hydrogen wavelengths are: 410 nm, 434 nm, 486 nm, and 656 nm.

For the 5000-line-per-centimeter grating:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{5000} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{5000} = 2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**(a) First-order angles with 5000 lines/cm grating:**

Using $$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d}$$ with m = 1:

**For λ = 410 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{410 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.205 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_1 = 11.8°$$
</div>

**For λ = 434 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{434 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.217 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_2 = 12.5°$$
</div>

**For λ = 486 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_3 = \frac{486 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.243 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_3 = 14.1°$$
</div>

**For λ = 656 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_4 = \frac{656 \times 10^{-9}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.328 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_4 = 19.2°$$
</div>

**First-order angles: 11.8°, 12.5°, 14.1°, 19.2°**

**(b) Second-order angles with 5000 lines/cm grating:**

Using $$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d}$$ with m = 2:

**For λ = 410 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{(2)(410 \times 10^{-9})}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.410 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_1 = 24.2°$$
</div>

**For λ = 434 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{(2)(434 \times 10^{-9})}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.434 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_2 = 25.7°$$
</div>

**For λ = 486 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_3 = \frac{(2)(486 \times 10^{-9})}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.486 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_3 = 29.1°$$
</div>

**For λ = 656 nm:**
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_4 = \frac{(2)(656 \times 10^{-9})}{2.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.656 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta_4 = 41.0°$$
</div>

**Second-order angles: 24.2°, 25.7°, 29.1°, 41.0°**

**(c) Relationship between line density and angles:**

Notice that the second-order angles for the 5000 lines/cm grating (24.2°, 25.7°, 29.1°, 41.0°) are exactly the same as the first-order angles for the 10,000 lines/cm grating from the previous problem!

This demonstrates a general principle: **When you decrease the number of lines per centimeter by a factor of n (thereby increasing d by a factor of n), the angles for the n-th order maximum with the new grating equal the angles for the first-order maximum with the original grating.**

Mathematically: If $$d_2 = n \cdot d_1$$, then $$\sin \theta_{m=1, d_1} = \frac{\lambda}{d_1}$$ equals $$\sin \theta_{m=n, d_2} = \frac{n\lambda}{n \cdot d_1} = \frac{\lambda}{d_1}$$.

In this case, halving the line density (10,000 → 5000 lines/cm) means doubling d, so the second-order (n=2) angles with the coarser grating equal the first-order angles with the finer grating.

**Discussion**

This scaling relationship is very useful in diffraction grating design. It shows that using a coarser grating with higher-order maxima can produce the same angular positions as using a finer grating with lower-order maxima. However, higher orders are generally dimmer and may suffer from overlapping spectra from different orders. The 5000 lines/cm grating produces more widely spaced orders, making them easier to observe separately, while the 10,000 lines/cm grating provides better resolution within each order.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the maximum number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a complete first-order spectrum for visible light?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a complete first-order spectrum, both the shortest (violet, ~380 nm) and longest (red, ~760 nm) wavelengths of visible light must have first-order maxima at angles less than 90°. The limiting condition is for the longest wavelength (red) at θ = 90°.

**Solution**

For the complete visible spectrum to be observable in first order, the red end (longest wavelength) must appear before 90°. Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 and $$\theta = 90°$$ (where $$\sin 90° = 1$$):

<div class="equation">
$$d = m\lambda_{\text{max}} = (1)(760 \text{ nm}) = 760 \text{ nm} = 7.60 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}$$
</div>

This is the **minimum** spacing needed. The maximum number of lines per centimeter is:

<div class="equation">
$$N = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{d} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{7.60 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}} = 13,158 \text{ lines/cm}$$
</div>

Rounding to appropriate significant figures:

<div class="equation">
$$N_{\text{max}} \approx 13,200 \text{ lines/cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

If the grating had more than ~13,200 lines/cm, the line spacing would be smaller than 760 nm, and the first-order maximum for red light would require $$\sin \theta > 1$$, which is impossible. The red end of the spectrum would not be observable in first order.

Let's verify: with d = 760 nm:
- **Red (760 nm):** sin θ = (1)(760)/760 = 1.00 → θ = 90° (just barely observable)
- **Violet (380 nm):** sin θ = (1)(380)/760 = 0.50 → θ = 30° (easily observable)

This grating would spread the complete visible spectrum from 30° to 90° in first order. Commercial gratings often have fewer lines/cm (~5000-10,000) to ensure good visibility of the complete spectrum at more convenient angles.

The yellow light from a sodium vapor lamp *seems* to be of pure wavelength, but it produces two first-order maxima at  $$ 36.093 ^\circ $$
 and  $$ 36.129 ^\circ $$
 when projected on a 10 000 line per centimeter diffraction grating. What are the two wavelengths to an accuracy of 0.1 nm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ to find each wavelength from its angle. First, calculate the grating spacing d from the line density, then solve for λ at each angle.

**Solution**

Given:
- Line density: 10,000 lines/cm
- $$\theta_1 = 36.093°$$
- $$\theta_2 = 36.129°$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order maxima)

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{10,000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{10,000} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the first wavelength**

Using $$\lambda = d \sin \theta / m$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_1 = d \sin \theta_1 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}) \sin 36.093°$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_1 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.58906) = 5.891 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 589.1 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Step 3: Find the second wavelength**

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_2 = d \sin \theta_2 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}) \sin 36.129°$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_2 = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(0.58963) = 5.896 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 589.6 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These two wavelengths, 589.1 nm and 589.6 nm, form the famous **sodium D-line doublet**. The two lines are separated by only 0.5 nm (or about 6 nm), which is why sodium light appears to be pure yellow to the eye - the two wavelengths are too close for the eye to distinguish.

The doublet arises from the fine structure of sodium's electron energy levels: transitions from two closely spaced upper states (²P₃/₂ and ²P₁/₂) to the same ground state (²S₁/₂) produce the D₂ line (589.0 nm) and D₁ line (589.6 nm).

This problem demonstrates the high resolving power of diffraction gratings. The angular separation is only 0.036°, yet the grating cleanly separates the two lines. The ability to resolve such closely spaced wavelengths is crucial for spectroscopic analysis in astronomy, chemistry, and physics.

What is the spacing between structures in a feather that acts as a reflection grating, given that they produce a first-order maximum for 525-nm light at a  $$ 30.0º $$
 angle?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a reflection grating, we use the same equation as for a transmission grating: $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$. We solve for d with m = 1.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 525 \text{ nm} = 525 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$\theta = 30.0°$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order maximum)

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{(1)(525 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{\sin 30.0°}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{525 \times 10^{-9}}{0.500} = 1.05 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.05 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The spacing of 1.05 μm (1050 nm) is about twice the wavelength of the green light being diffracted. This is typical for structural coloration in bird feathers and insect wings.

The iridescent colors in peacock feathers, hummingbird feathers, and butterfly wings are produced by such natural diffraction gratings. The spacing is created by regular arrangements of microscopic structures like barbules (in feathers) or scales (in butterfly wings). The color changes with viewing angle because different angles produce constructive interference for different wavelengths according to $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$.

This biological "engineering" produces brilliant colors without pigments - the colors are purely structural and result from wave interference. These colors often don't fade over time like pigment-based colors do, which is why museum specimens of iridescent birds and butterflies remain colorful for centuries.

Structures on a bird feather act like a reflection grating having 8000 lines per centimeter. What is the angle of the first-order maximum for 600-nm light?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 to find the angle. First, calculate the spacing d from the line density, then solve for θ.

**Solution**

Given:
- Line density: 8000 lines/cm
- $$\lambda = 600 \text{ nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the structure spacing**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{8000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{8000} = 1.25 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the angle**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d} = \frac{(1)(600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{1.25 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{600}{1250} = 0.480$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.480) = 28.7°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first-order maximum for orange-red light (600 nm) appears at 28.7° from the normal. This angle is typical for structural coloration in bird feathers. The spacing of 1.25 μm is roughly twice the wavelength, which is ideal for producing visible diffraction patterns.

Birds with iridescent feathers (like hummingbirds, peacocks, and starlings) have microscopic structures on their feather barbules that act as natural diffraction gratings. As the bird moves and the viewing angle changes, different wavelengths satisfy the constructive interference condition, causing the brilliant color shifts characteristic of iridescence. For this feather, shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) would appear at smaller angles, while longer wavelengths (red) would appear at larger angles, creating a rainbow effect with changing perspective.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ for the first-order maximum (m = 1) with d = 8 μm. Use λ ≈ 700 nm for red and λ ≈ 450 nm for blue.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$d = 8 \text{ μm} = 8 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order, typically the brightest)

**(a) Red light (λ ≈ 700 nm):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{red}} = \frac{m\lambda}{d} = \frac{(1)(700 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{8 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 0.0875$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{red}} = \sin^{-1}(0.0875) = 5.0°$$

**(b) Blue light (λ ≈ 450 nm):**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_{\text{blue}} = \frac{(1)(450 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{8 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 0.0563$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_{\text{blue}} = \sin^{-1}(0.0563) = 3.2°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The diffraction angles are quite small (3.2° for blue, 5.0° for red) because the grating spacing (8 μm) is much larger than the wavelengths of visible light. Red light appears at a larger angle than blue light, which is why when you rotate an opal, you see different colors from different angles - this is the source of opal's famous "play of color" or iridescence.

The complete visible spectrum would spread from about 3° (violet) to 5° (red). Higher orders (m = 2, 3, etc.) would appear at larger angles but with decreasing intensity. The maximum order possible is m_max = d/λ_max ≈ 8000/700 ≈ 11, so many orders are theoretically possible, though in practice only the first few are bright enough to see.

Opals contain tiny silica spheres arranged in regular patterns, creating these natural diffraction gratings. The spacing of 8 μm is roughly 10-20 wavelengths of visible light, perfect for producing brilliant iridescent colors.

At what angle does a diffraction grating produces a second-order maximum for light having a first-order maximum at  $$ 20.0º $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ for both orders. From the first-order angle, find the ratio λ/d, then use this to find the second-order angle.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\theta_1 = 20.0°$$ (first-order maximum)
- Find: $$\theta_2$$ (second-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the ratio λ/d from the first-order condition**

For the first-order maximum (m = 1):

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta_1 = (1)\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin \theta_1 = \sin 20.0° = 0.342$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the second-order angle**

For the second-order maximum (m = 2):

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta_2 = 2\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{d} = 2 \times 0.342 = 0.684$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \sin^{-1}(0.684) = 43.2°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The second-order maximum appears at 43.2°, more than twice the first-order angle (20.0°). This is because the sine function is nonlinear - while sin θ doubles from first to second order, the angle itself more than doubles.

This result is general: for any diffraction grating, if the first-order maximum is at angle θ₁, the second-order maximum is at θ₂ = sin⁻¹(2 sin θ₁). Notice that the second-order angle exists only if 2 sin θ₁ ≤ 1, which requires θ₁ ≤ 30°. Since 20° < 30°, the second-order maximum is observable. If θ₁ were greater than 30°, no second-order maximum would exist (consistent with our earlier proof).

Show that a diffraction grating cannot produce a second-order maximum for a given wavelength of light unless the first-order maximum is at an angle less than  $$ 30.0º $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ for both first and second orders. For the second-order to exist, it must occur at θ < 90°.

**Solution**

For the **first-order maximum** (m = 1):
<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta_1 = \lambda$$
</div>

For the **second-order maximum** (m = 2) to be observable, it must occur at some angle θ₂ < 90°. At the limiting case where θ₂ = 90°:

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta_2 = 2\lambda$$
</div>

With $$\sin \theta_2 = \sin 90° = 1$$:

<div class="equation">
$$d = 2\lambda$$
</div>

Now substitute this back into the first-order equation:

<div class="equation">
$$2\lambda \sin \theta_1 = \lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.500$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \sin^{-1}(0.500) = 30.0°$$
</div>

**Therefore:** If θ₁ = 30.0°, the second-order maximum just barely appears at θ₂ = 90°. If θ₁ > 30.0°, then d < 2λ, which would require $$\sin \theta_2 > 1$$ for the second-order maximum - which is impossible.

**Conclusion:** A second-order maximum can only exist if the first-order maximum appears at θ₁ < 30.0°. **Q.E.D.**

**Discussion**

This result has important practical implications for diffraction grating design. If you observe that a first-order maximum appears at an angle greater than 30°, you immediately know that:
1. No second-order maximum exists for that wavelength
2. The grating spacing is less than twice the wavelength (d < 2λ)
3. At most, only first-order maxima will be observable (plus the zero-order central maximum)

For example, if violet light (380 nm) produces its first maximum at 35°, the grating spacing is only about 600 nm, and no higher orders can be observed for visible light.

Given:
- Shortest visible wavelength: $$\lambda_V = 380 \text{ nm}$$ (violet)
- Longest visible wavelength: $$\lambda_R = 760 \text{ nm}$$ (red)
- $$\theta_V = 30.0°$$ for violet light
- $$m = 1$$ (first-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing from the violet condition**

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin \theta_V = m\lambda_V$$

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{m\lambda_V}{\sin \theta_V} = \frac{(1)(380 \text{ nm})}{\sin 30.0°} = \frac{380}{0.500} = 760 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the angle for red light**

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_R = \frac{m\lambda_R}{d} = \frac{(1)(760 \text{ nm})}{760 \text{ nm}} = 1.00$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_R = \sin^{-1}(1.00) = 90.0°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The remarkable result is that the red end of the visible spectrum appears at exactly 90°! This is the limiting case where the first-order maximum just barely exists.

Notice that the grating spacing d = 760 nm exactly equals the wavelength of red light. This is the critical condition: when d = λ_max, the longest wavelength appears at 90°. If the grating had even slightly finer spacing (d < 760 nm), red light would not produce a first-order maximum at all.

This grating with d = 760 nm produces a complete visible spectrum spreading from 30° (violet) to 90° (red) in first order. The complete visible spectrum is compressed into a 60° angular range. This is actually the finest-spacing grating that can show the complete visible spectrum in first order - any finer and the red end would be cut off.

(a) Find the maximum number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a maximum for the smallest wavelength of visible light. (b) Would such a grating be useful for ultraviolet spectra? (c) For infrared spectra?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), the smallest visible wavelength (violet, ~380 nm) must produce at least a first-order maximum before θ = 90°. For parts (b) and (c), we check if UV and IR wavelengths can produce maxima with this grating spacing.

**Solution**

**(a) Maximum lines per centimeter:**

The smallest visible wavelength is approximately λ = 380 nm (violet). For a first-order maximum to just barely exist at θ = 90°:

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin 90° = (1)\lambda$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = \lambda = 380 \text{ nm} = 3.80 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}$$
</div>

Maximum number of lines per centimeter:

<div class="equation">
$$N_{\text{max}} = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{d} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{3.80 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}} = 26,316 \text{ lines/cm}$$
</div>

Rounding: **N ≈ 26,300 lines/cm**

**(b) Useful for ultraviolet spectra?**

UV wavelengths are shorter than visible light (λ < 380 nm). For example, UV-A is around 315-380 nm.

Since d = 380 nm and λ_UV < 380 nm, we have d > λ_UV, so:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda_{\text{UV}}}{d} < \frac{m \times 380}{380} = m$$
</div>

For first order (m = 1), sin θ < 1, so maxima will exist for UV light.

**Yes, this grating would be useful for UV spectra.** In fact, UV wavelengths would produce maxima at smaller angles than violet light, making them easier to observe.

**(c) Useful for infrared spectra?**

IR wavelengths are longer than visible light. For example, near-IR is around 760 nm - 2500 nm.

For λ_IR = 760 nm with d = 380 nm:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{(1)(760 \text{ nm})}{380 \text{ nm}} = 2$$
</div>

Since sin θ cannot exceed 1, **no first-order maximum exists** for 760 nm IR light.

**No, this grating would NOT be useful for infrared spectra** because d < λ for all IR wavelengths, making it impossible to produce even first-order maxima.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates an important principle: gratings with very fine spacing (high line density) are excellent for short wavelengths (UV, violet) but useless for long wavelengths (IR, red). The ideal grating depends on the wavelength range of interest. For IR spectroscopy, gratings with much wider spacing (fewer lines/cm) are needed.

(a) Show that a 30 000-line-per-centimeter grating will not produce a maximum for visible light. (b) What is the longest wavelength for which it does produce a first-order maximum? (c) What is the greatest number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a complete second-order spectrum for visible light?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), find the grating spacing d, then determine the maximum wavelength that can produce a first-order maximum (at θ = 90°). For part (b), this maximum wavelength is the answer. For part (c), the longest visible wavelength (760 nm) must produce a second-order maximum at θ < 90°.

**Solution**

**(a) Show that 30,000 lines/cm won't produce visible light maxima:**

First, find the grating spacing:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{30,000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{30,000} = 3.333 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 333.3 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

For a first-order maximum to exist, we need θ ≤ 90°. At the limiting case (θ = 90°):

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin 90° = (1)\lambda_{\text{max}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_{\text{max}} = d = 333.3 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

Since the visible spectrum ranges from 380 nm (violet) to 760 nm (red), and the maximum wavelength this grating can diffract is 333.3 nm (which is in the ultraviolet range), **no visible light wavelengths can produce even a first-order maximum**. All visible wavelengths exceed the grating spacing, making sin θ > 1, which is impossible.

**(b) Longest wavelength for first-order maximum:**

From part (a), the longest wavelength that can produce a first-order maximum is:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_{\text{max}} = d = 333 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

This is in the **ultraviolet (UV) range**.

**(c) Greatest number of lines/cm for complete second-order visible spectrum:**

For a complete second-order spectrum, the longest visible wavelength (760 nm, red) must have its second-order maximum at θ ≤ 90°. At the limiting case:

<div class="equation">
$$d \sin 90° = m\lambda_{\text{red}}$$
</div>

With m = 2 and λ_red = 760 nm:

<div class="equation">
$$d = 2 \times 760 \text{ nm} = 1520 \text{ nm} = 1.520 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
</div>

Maximum number of lines per centimeter:

<div class="equation">
$$N_{\text{max}} = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{d} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{1.520 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 6579 \text{ lines/cm}$$
</div>

Rounding to three significant figures: **N ≈ 6.58 × 10³ lines/cm**

**Discussion**

Part (a) demonstrates an important limitation: extremely fine gratings (like 30,000 lines/cm with d = 333 nm) cannot diffract visible light at all because the wavelengths exceed the grating spacing. Such fine gratings are useful only for short-wavelength radiation like UV or X-rays.

For part (c), the result shows that to observe a complete second-order visible spectrum, the grating cannot have more than about 6,580 lines/cm. If it had more lines, the red end of the spectrum wouldn't appear in second order. This is roughly half the maximum for a first-order spectrum (~13,200 lines/cm), which makes sense because second-order requires twice the path difference (2λ instead of λ).

Practical commercial gratings typically have 300-10,000 lines/cm, comfortably within the range to show complete visible spectra in both first and second orders.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A He–Ne laser beam is reflected from the surface of a CD onto a wall. The brightest spot is the reflected beam at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. However, fringes are also observed. If the wall is 1.50 m from the CD, and the first fringe is 0.600 m from the central maximum, what is the spacing of grooves on the CD?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The CD acts as a reflection grating. We use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ with m = 1 for the first fringe. First, find the angle θ from the geometry, then solve for d. He-Ne laser wavelength is 633 nm.

**Solution**

Given:
- Distance to wall: L = 1.50 m
- Position of first fringe: y = 0.600 m
- λ = 633 nm (He-Ne laser)
- m = 1 (first-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the angle**

From geometry:

<div class="equation">
$$\tan \theta = \frac{y}{L} = \frac{0.600 \text{ m}}{1.50 \text{ m}} = 0.400$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(0.400) = 21.8°$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \sin 21.8° = 0.371$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the groove spacing**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin \theta} = \frac{(1)(633 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{0.371}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = 1.71 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.71 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The groove spacing of 1.71 μm is typical for CDs. The actual standard spacing for CDs is 1.6 μm (corresponding to about 625 grooves per mm). Our calculated value of 1.71 μm is quite close, with the small difference possibly due to:
- Measurement uncertainties in the fringe position
- The angle of incidence affecting the effective spacing
- Rounding in the given measurements

This demonstrates how CDs can be used as inexpensive diffraction gratings for educational demonstrations. The regular spacing of pits and lands on a CD creates a periodic structure that diffracts laser light, producing the colorful iridescent patterns you see when white light reflects from a CD surface.

The analysis shown in the figure below also applies to diffraction gratings with lines separated by a distance  $$d $$ .
 What is the distance between fringes produced by a diffraction grating having 125 lines per centimeter for 600-nm light, if the screen is 1.50 m away?

![The figure shows a schematic of a double slit experiment. A double slit is at the left and a screen is at the right. The slits are separated by a distance d. From the midpoint between the slits a horizontal line labeled x extends to the screen. From the same point, a line angled upward at an angle theta above the horizontal also extends to the screen. The distance between where the horizontal line hits the screen and where the angled line hits the screen is marked y, and the distance between adjacent fringes is given by delta y, which equals x times lambda over d](../resources/Figure_27_04_06.jpg 'The distance between adjacent fringes is ( \\Delta y=x \\lambda/d ), assuming the slit separation ( d ) is large compared with ( \\lambda ).')
{: #Figure6}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the formula for fringe spacing: $$\Delta y = x\lambda/d$$, where x is the distance to the screen. First, find d from the line density, then calculate Δy.

**Solution**

Given:
- Line density: 125 lines/cm
- $$\lambda = 600 \text{ nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- Distance to screen: $$x = 1.50 \text{ m}$$

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{125 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{125} = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Calculate the fringe spacing**

Using $$\Delta y = \frac{x\lambda}{d}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta y = \frac{(1.50 \text{ m})(600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{8.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta y = \frac{9.00 \times 10^{-7}}{8.00 \times 10^{-5}} = 1.125 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta y = 1.13 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} = 1.13 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The fringe spacing of 1.13 cm is quite large and easily observable. This is because the grating has a relatively coarse spacing (125 lines/cm = 80 μm between lines), which is about 133 wavelengths. The formula Δy = xλ/d shows that:
- Larger screen distance (x) increases fringe spacing
- Larger wavelength (λ) increases fringe spacing
- Smaller slit separation (d) increases fringe spacing

With adjacent fringes separated by over 1 cm at a distance of 1.5 m, this pattern would be very easy to observe and measure. Finer gratings (more lines/cm) would produce smaller fringe spacings. For example, a 1000 lines/cm grating would have fringes separated by only 1.4 mm at the same distance.

**Unreasonable Results**

Red light of wavelength of 700 nm falls on a double slit separated by 400 nm. (
a) At what angle is the first-order maximum in the diffraction pattern? (b) What
is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or
inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ for double-slit interference with m = 1. Examine whether the result is physically possible.

**Solution**

**(a) Angle for first-order maximum:**

Given:
- $$\lambda = 700 \text{ nm} = 700 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$d = 400 \text{ nm} = 400 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$
- $$m = 1$$

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{d} = \frac{(1)(700 \text{ nm})}{400 \text{ nm}} = 1.75$$
</div>

This requires $$\theta = \sin^{-1}(1.75)$$, which is **undefined** (no solution exists).

**(b) What is unreasonable about this result?**

The sine function can only have values between -1 and +1 for real angles. A value of sin θ = 1.75 is **impossible** - there is no real angle whose sine equals 1.75. This means no first-order maximum can exist for this configuration.

**(c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?**

The unreasonable assumption is that a **slit separation of 400 nm can produce an interference pattern for 700-nm light**.

For a double-slit interference pattern to show at least one maximum (besides the central maximum), we need:

<div class="equation">
$$d \geq \lambda$$
</div>

In this problem, d = 400 nm < λ = 700 nm. When the slit separation is smaller than the wavelength, no off-axis maxima can occur. The only observable feature would be the central maximum (m = 0), which exists for all wavelengths.

**The inconsistency** is assuming that red light (700 nm) with a relatively long wavelength can create a normal double-slit pattern with slits separated by only 400 nm.  Either:
- The wavelength should be shorter (≤ 400 nm, like UV or violet light), OR
- The slit separation should be larger (≥ 700 nm)

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates an important physical limitation: you cannot create interference patterns of a certain order if the wavelength exceeds the slit separation. In practical terms, attempting this experiment would result in only seeing a broad central diffraction maximum with no side fringes - essentially no interference pattern. This is why diffraction gratings and double-slit apparatus must have appropriate spacing for the wavelength being studied.

**Strategy**

Use $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$ to find the wavelength. First, calculate the grating spacing d from the line density, then solve for λ with m = 4. Examine whether the result makes sense.

**Solution**

**(a) Calculate the wavelength:**

Given:
- Line density: 25,000 lines/cm
- $$\theta = 25.0°$$
- $$m = 4$$ (fourth-order maximum)

**Step 1: Find the grating spacing**

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{1 \text{ cm}}{25,000 \text{ lines}} = \frac{0.01 \text{ m}}{25,000} = 4.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 400 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Step 2: Find the wavelength**

Using $$d \sin \theta = m\lambda$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{d \sin \theta}{m} = \frac{(4.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}) \sin 25.0°}{4}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{(4.00 \times 10^{-7})(0.4226)}{4} = \frac{1.690 \times 10^{-7}}{4}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = 4.23 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m} = 42.3 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**(b) What is unreasonable about this result?**

The calculated wavelength of **42.3 nm is NOT visible light**. The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 760 nm (red). A wavelength of 42.3 nm falls in the **extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range**, which is far beyond what the human eye can detect. The problem asks for a "visible wavelength," but the result is not visible at all.

**(c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?**

There are two unreasonable aspects to this problem:

**1. The grating is too fine for visible light diffraction:**

The grating spacing is only 400 nm, which is barely larger than the shortest visible wavelength (380 nm). For a fourth-order maximum to exist for visible light, we would need:

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{4\lambda}{d} \leq 1$$
</div>

For the shortest visible wavelength (380 nm):

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta = \frac{4 \times 380}{400} = 3.8 > 1 \quad \text{(impossible!)}$$
</div>

**No visible wavelength can produce even a first-order maximum** with a 400 nm grating spacing at any reasonable angle, let alone a fourth-order maximum at 25°.

**2. Practical manufacturing limitations:**

A grating with 25,000 lines/cm (d = 400 nm) is at the very edge of what can be manufactured using advanced nanofabrication techniques. While modern electron-beam lithography can achieve features around 50 nm, creating uniform, large-area diffraction gratings with such fine spacing is extremely challenging and expensive. Such gratings would be more suitable for X-ray or EUV spectroscopy, not visible light.

**The inconsistent assumptions are:**
- Expecting visible light to produce a fourth-order maximum with such fine grating spacing
- Assuming 25,000 lines/cm is reasonable for a visible-light spectrometer (it's far too fine)
- For visible light spectroscopy, gratings typically have 300-10,000 lines/cm

**Discussion**

This problem highlights the importance of matching grating spacing to wavelength. The grating spacing should be several times larger than the wavelength of interest to produce observable higher-order maxima. A grating with d = 400 nm is appropriate for ultraviolet or extreme ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths < 100 nm), not for visible light. For visible light and fourth-order maxima, a grating with d ≥ 4 × 760 nm = 3040 nm (corresponding to ~3300 lines/cm or fewer) would be more appropriate.
