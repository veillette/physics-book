### Work Done Against Gravity

Climbing stairs and lifting objects is work in both the scientific and everyday
sense—it is work done against the gravitational force. When there is work, there
is a transformation of energy. The work done against the gravitational force
goes into an important form of stored energy that we will explore in this
section.

Let us calculate the work done in lifting an object of mass $$ m $$ through a
height $$ h $$, such as in [Figure 1](#Figure1). If the object is lifted straight
up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its weight $$
mg $$. The work done on the mass is then $$ W = Fd = mgh $$. We define this to
be the **gravitational potential energy** $$ \left(\PE_{\text{g}}\right) $$ put
into (or gained by) the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with the
state of separation between two objects that attract each other by the
gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the $$ \PE_{\text{g}}

$$
gained by the object, recognizing that this is energy stored in the
gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word “system”? Potential energy
is a property of a system rather than of a single object—due to its physical
position. An object’s gravitational potential is due to its position relative to
the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object
is an external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it
increases the gravitational potential energy of the system. Because
gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference
level at which to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this
point to be Earth’s surface, but this point is arbitrary; what is important is
the *difference* in gravitational potential energy, because this difference is
what relates to the work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy
of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two rungs of a ladder will be
the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs.

### Converting Between Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy

Gravitational potential energy may be converted to other forms of energy, such
as kinetic energy. If we release the mass, gravitational force will do an amount
of work equal to $$ mgh $$ on it, thereby increasing its kinetic energy by that
same amount (by the work-energy theorem). We will find it more useful to
consider just the conversion of $$ \PE_{\text{g}} $$ to $$ \KE $$ without
explicitly considering the intermediate step of work. (
See [Example 2](#example2).) This shortcut makes it is easier to solve problems
using energy (if possible) rather than explicitly using forces.

![(a) The weight attached to the cuckoo clock is raised by a height h shown by a displacement vector d pointing upward. The weight is attached to a winding chain labeled with a force F vector pointing downward. Vector d is also shown in the same direction as force F. E in is equal to W and W is equal to m g h. (b) The weight attached to the cuckoo clock moves downward. E out is equal to m g h.](../resources/Figure_07_03_01.jpg "(a) The work done to lift the weight is stored in the mass-Earth system as gravitational potential energy. (b) As the weight moves downward, this gravitational potential energy is transferred to the cuckoo clock.")
{: #Figure1}

More precisely, we define the *change* in gravitational potential energy
$$

\Delta \PE\_{\text{g}} $$ to be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=mgh , $$
</div>

where, for simplicity, we denote the change in height by $$ h $$ rather than the
usual $$ \Delta h $$. Note that $$ h $$ is positive when the final height is
greater than the initial height, and vice versa. For example, if a 0.500-kg mass
hung from a cuckoo clock is raised 1.00 m, then its change in gravitational
potential energy is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
mgh &=& \left(0.500 \kg \right)\left( 9.80\mss \right)\left(1.00 \m \right)\\
mgh &=& 4.90 \kg \cdot \mmss= 4.90 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>

Note that the units of gravitational potential energy turn out to be joules, the
same as for work and other forms of energy. As the clock runs, the mass is
lowered. We can think of the mass as gradually giving up its 4.90 J of
gravitational potential energy, _without directly considering the force of
gravity that does the work_.

### Using Potential Energy to Simplify Calculations

The equation $$ \Delta \PE\_{\text{g}}=mgh $$ applies for any path that has a
change in height of $$ h $$, not just when the mass is lifted straight up. (
See [Figure 2](#Figure2).) It is much easier to calculate $$ mgh $$
(a simple multiplication) than it is to calculate the work done along a
complicated path. The idea of gravitational potential energy has the double
advantage that it is very broadly applicable and it makes calculations easier.
From now on, we will consider that any change in vertical position $$ h $$ of a
mass $$ m $$ is accompanied by a change in gravitational potential energy $$ mgh

$$
, and we will avoid the equivalent but more difficult task of calculating work
done by or against the gravitational force.

A girl is standing outside the building and is lifting a similar television with the help of a pulley.](../resources/Figure_07_03_02.jpg "The change in gravitational potential energy \( (\Delta \PE_\text{g} ) \) between points A and B is independent of the path. \( \Delta \PE_\text{g} =mgh \) for any path between the two points. Gravity is one of a small class of forces where the work done by or against the force depends only on the starting and ending points, not on the path between them.")

The Force to Stop Falling
</div>
A 60.0-kg person jumps onto the floor from a height of 3.00 m. If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints
compressing by 0.500 cm), calculate the force on the knee joints.

**Strategy**

This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on
him by the floor as he stops. The initial $$ \PE_{\text{g}} $$ is transformed
into $$ \KE $$ as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic
energy to zero.

**Solution**

The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} =-F d , $$
</div>
with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions $$ \left(\cos{\theta} =\cos{ 180^\circ }=-1\right) $$. The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work.

The kinetic energy the person has upon reaching the floor is the amount of
potential energy lost by falling through height $$ h $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \KE=-\Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=-mgh , $$
</div>
The distance $$ d $$ that the person’s knees bend is much smaller than the height $$ h $$ of the
fall, so the additional change in gravitational potential energy during the knee
bend is ignored.

The work $$ W $$ done by the floor on the person stops the person and brings the
person’s kinetic energy to zero:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W=-\KE=mgh . $$
</div>
Combining this equation with the expression for $$ W $$ gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ -F d =mgh . $$
</div>
Recalling that $$ h $$ is negative because the person fell *down*,
the force on the knee joints is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ F=-\frac{mgh }{d}=-\frac{ \left(60.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(-3.00 \m \right)}{5.00\times 10^{-3}\m }=3.53\times 10^{5}N. $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Such a large force (500 times more than the person’s weight) over the short
impact time is enough to break bones. A much better way to cushion the shock is
by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the
force acts. A bending motion of 0.5 m this way yields a force 100 times smaller
than in the example. A kangaroo\'s hopping shows this method in action. The
kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for locomotion, but the shock
in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).)

</div>

![A hopping kangaroo is shown landing on the ground in one photograph and in the air just after taking another jump in the second photograph.](../resources/Figure_07_03_03.jpg "The work done by the ground upon the kangaroo reduces its kinetic energy to zero as it lands.

Finding the Speed of a Roller Coaster from its Height
</div>
(a) What is the final speed of the roller coaster shown in [Figure 3](#Figure3) if it starts from rest at the top of the 20.0 m hill and work done by frictional forces is negligible?
(b) What is its final speed (again assuming negligible friction) if its initial speed is 5.00 m/s?

![A roller coaster track is shown with a car about to go downhill. The initial height of the roller coaster car on the track is twenty-five meters from the lowest part of the track and its speed v sub zero is equal to zero. The roller coaster&#x2019;s height from the level part of the track is twenty meters. The finish point of the car is on the level part of the track and the speed at that point is unknown.](../resources/Figure_07_03_04.jpg "The speed of a roller coaster increases as gravity pulls it downhill and is greatest at its lowest point. Viewed in terms of energy, the roller-coaster-Earth system&#x2019;s gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If work done by friction is negligible, all \( \Delta \PE_\text{g} \) is converted to \( \Delta \KE \) .")
{: #Figure4 height="200"}

**Strategy**

The roller coaster loses potential energy as it goes downhill. We neglect
friction, so that the remaining force exerted by the track is the normal force,
which is perpendicular to the direction of motion and does no work. The net work
on the roller coaster is then done by gravity alone. The *loss* of gravitational
potential energy from moving *downward*
through a distance $$ h $$ equals the *gain* in kinetic energy. This can be
written in equation form as $$ -\Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=\Delta \KE $$. Using the
equations for $$ \PE_{\text{g}} $$ and $$ \KE $$, we can solve for the final
speed $$ v $$, which is the desired quantity.

**Solution for (a)**

Here the initial kinetic energy is zero, so that $$ \Delta \KE=\frac{1}{2}m
v^{2} $$. The equation for change in potential energy states that $$ \Delta \PE_
{\text{g}}=mgh $$. Since $$ h $$ is negative in this case, we will rewrite this
as $$ \Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=-mg \mid h\mid $$ to show the minus sign clearly.
Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ -\Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=\Delta \KE $$
</div>
becomes

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg \mid h\mid =\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}. $$
</div>
Solving for $$ v $$, we find that mass cancels and that

<div class="equation">
 $$ v=\sqrt{2g\mid h\mid }. $$
</div>
Substituting known values,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v&=& \sqrt{2\left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(20.0 \m \right)}\\
v&=&19.6 \ms .
\end{array}
$$

</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Again $$ -\Delta \PE_{\text{g}}=\Delta \KE $$. In this case there is initial
kinetic energy, so $$ \Delta \KE=\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m v_{0}^{2} $$.
Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg \mid h\mid =\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m v_{0}^{2}. $$
</div>
Rearranging gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=mg \mid h\mid +\frac{1}{2}m  v_{0}^{2}. $$
</div>
This means that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy. Mass again cancels, and

<div class="equation">
 $$ v=\sqrt{2g\mid h\mid +v_{0}^{2}}. $$
</div>
This equation is very similar to the kinematics equation $$ v=\sqrt{ v_{0}^{2}+2ad} $$,
but it is more general—the kinematics equation is valid only for constant
acceleration, whereas our equation above is valid for any path regardless of
whether the object moves with a constant acceleration. Now, substituting known
values gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v&=& \sqrt{2\left(9.80\mss \right)\left(20.0 \m \right)+\left(5.00 \ms \right)^{2}}\\
v&=& 20.4 \ms .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion and Implications**

First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made
in [Falling Objects](./ch2FallingObjects)
that all objects fall at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only
the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no information about its
direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is
negligible, the speed of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and
height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the roller coaster
will have the same final speed whether it falls 20.0 m straight down or takes a
more complicated path like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps
unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but by
far less than 5.00 m/s. Finally, note that speed can be found at _any_ height
along the way by simply using the appropriate value of $$ h $$ at the point of
interest.

</div>

We have seen that work done by or against the gravitational force depends only
on the starting and ending points, and not on the path between, allowing us to
define the simplifying concept of gravitational potential energy. We can do the
same thing for a few other forces, and we will see that this leads to a formal
definition of the law of conservation of energy.

Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy
</div>
One can study the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy in this experiment. On a smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an incline (see [Figure 5](#Figure5)). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll 1 m on the level surface. Find the velocity of the marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble’s kinetic energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point.

### Section Summary

- Work done against gravity in lifting an object becomes potential energy of the
  object-Earth system.
- The change in gravitational potential energy, $$ \Delta \PE_{\text{g}} $$, is
  $$ \Delta \PE_{g}=mgh $$, with $$ h $$ being the increase in height and $$ g
  $$ the acceleration due to gravity.
- The gravitational potential energy of an object near Earth’s surface is due to
  its position in the mass-Earth system. Only differences in gravitational
  potential energy, $$ \Delta \PE\_{g} $$, have physical significance.
- As an object descends without friction, its gravitational potential energy
  changes into kinetic energy corresponding to increasing speed, so that $$
  \Delta \KE=-\Delta \PE_{\text{g}} $$.

(a) Use the gravitational potential energy formula $$ \PE_g = mgh $$ with the given mass and height.
(b) Compare this to the energy of a 9-megaton fusion bomb, where 1 megaton TNT equivalent = $$ 4.18 \times 10^{15} $$ J.

**Solution**

**(a) Gravitational potential energy of the lake:**

**Given:**
- Mass of water: $$ m = 5.00 \times 10^{13}\text{ kg} $$
- Average height above generators: $$ h = 40.0\text{ m} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \PE_g = mgh = (5.00 \times 10^{13}\text{ kg})(9.80\mss)(40.0\text{ m}) $$

**(b) Comparison with 9-megaton fusion bomb:**

Energy in a 9-megaton bomb:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{bomb} = 9 \times 4.18 \times 10^{15}\text{ J} = 3.76 \times 10^{16}\text{ J} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{\PE_g}{E_{bomb}} = \frac{1.96 \times 10^{16}}{3.76 \times 10^{16}} = 0.52 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The gravitational potential energy stored in this reservoir is enormous - about $$ 2 \times 10^{16} $$ joules. This is approximately half the energy of a 9-megaton nuclear fusion bomb, which puts the scale of hydroelectric power into perspective. Unlike a bomb that releases its energy in an instant, hydroelectric facilities release this energy gradually over time, converting it to useful electrical power. A 50 km³ reservoir is quite large (for comparison, Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam holds about 35 km³), but the energy it stores demonstrates why hydroelectric power is such a significant energy source.

**Answer**

(a) The gravitational potential energy is $$ 1.96 \times 10^{16}\text{ J} $$.

(b) The ratio is 0.52, meaning the lake stores about half the energy of a 9-megaton fusion bomb.

(a) How much gravitational potential energy (relative to the ground on which it is built) is stored in the

(b) How does this energy compare with the daily food intake of a person?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the gravitational potential energy formula $$ \PE\_{g} = mgh $$, where $$ m $$ is the mass of the pyramid, $$ g = 9.80\mss $$, and $$ h $$ is the height of the center of mass.

For part (b), we compare this energy to the typical daily food intake of about $$ 1.2 \times 10^{7}\J $$ (or 2400 kcal).

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\PE_{g} &=& mgh\\
\PE_{g} &=& (7 \times 10^{9}\kg)(9.80\mss)(36.5\m)\\

**Discussion**

The gravitational potential energy stored in the Great Pyramid is approximately $$ 2.5 \times 10^{12}\J $$, which is equivalent to about 210,000 days of food intake for one person, or roughly 575 years worth of food energy. This immense amount of potential energy was stored by doing work to lift millions of stone blocks to build the pyramid. The comparison with daily food intake helps illustrate the enormous amount of human labor that went into constructing this ancient monument over approximately 20 years.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Work done against gravity equals the change in gravitational potential energy: $$ W = mgh $$. Calculate separately for the snake and for the bird's own mass.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Bird mass: $$ m_{bird} = 350\text{ g} = 0.350\text{ kg} $$
- Snake mass: $$ m_{snake} = 75\text{ g} = 0.075\text{ kg} $$

**(a) Work done on the snake:**

**Discussion**

The bird does significantly more work lifting itself (8.6 J) than lifting the snake (1.8 J), even though the snake represents extra payload. The total work done is 10.4 J. This illustrates that for flying animals, the energy cost of carrying prey is relatively small compared to the energy needed for their own flight. The kookaburra, famous for eating snakes, must be strong enough to lift its own body weight repeatedly, and carrying a snake that's about 21% of its body mass is a modest additional burden.

**Strategy**

We calculate the change in potential energy $$ \Delta \PE = mg\mid h\mid $$ and the initial kinetic energy $$ \KE_{\text{i}} = \frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2} $$, then find their ratio. The mass will cancel out.

**Solution**

The change in potential energy is:

**Discussion**

The change in potential energy is approximately 16 times greater than the initial kinetic energy, confirming that $$ \Delta \PE \gg \KE\_{\text{i}} $$. This explains why the final speed is only slightly greater when starting with an initial speed of 5.00 m/s compared to starting from rest—the gravitational potential energy converted to kinetic energy dominates over the initial kinetic energy. This result is important in many practical situations: when objects fall from significant heights, their initial velocity has little effect on the final velocity.

<div class="equation">

$$ v_f = \sqrt{4.00 - 3.528} = \sqrt{0.472} = 0.687\ms $$

**Discussion**

The toy car slows from 2.00 m/s to 0.687 m/s as it climbs 0.180 m. Most of its initial kinetic energy (88%) is converted to gravitational potential energy at the top of the slope. This problem illustrates conservation of mechanical energy on a frictionless surface - the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) remains constant throughout the motion.

**Answer**

The final speed is $$ v_f = 0.687\ms $$, as required.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
In a downhill ski race, surprisingly, little advantage is gained by getting a running start.
(This is because the initial kinetic energy is small compared with the gain in gravitational potential energy on even small hills.) To demonstrate this, find the final speed and the time taken for a skier who skies 70.0 m along a $$ 30^\circ $$
slope neglecting friction:
(a) Starting from rest.
(b) Starting with an initial  speed of 2.50 m/s.
(c) Does the answer surprise you? Discuss why it is still advantageous to get a running start in very competitive events.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use conservation of energy: $$ \KE_{\text{i}} + \PE_{\text{i}} = \KE_{\text{f}} + \PE_{\text{f}} $$. The height descended is $$ h = d\sin{\theta} = (70.0\m)\sin{30^\circ} = 35.0\m $$. For the time, we use kinematics with constant acceleration $$ a = g\sin{\theta} $$ down the slope.

**Solution for (a)**

Starting from rest ($$ v\_{0} = 0 $$):

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
mgh &=& \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\
v &=& \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2(9.80\mss)(35.0\m)}\\
v &=& \sqrt{686\text{ m}^{2}/\text{s}^{2}} = 26.2\ms
\end{array} $$
</div>

For time, using $$ v^{2} = v\_{0}^{2} + 2ad $$ with $$ a = g\sin{30^\circ} = 4.90\mss $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ v = v_{0} + at \Rightarrow t = \frac{v-v_{0}}{a} = \frac{26.2\ms}{4.90\mss} = 5.35\s $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

With initial speed $$ v\_{0} = 2.50\ms $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2} + mgh &=& \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\
v &=& \sqrt{v_{0}^{2} + 2gh}\\
v &=& \sqrt{(2.50\ms)^{2} + 2(9.80\mss)(35.0\m)}\\
v &=& \sqrt{6.25 + 686}\text{ m/s} = \sqrt{692.25}\text{ m/s}\\
v &=& 26.3\ms
\end{array} $$
</div>

For time, using $$ v = v\_{0} + at $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ t = \frac{v-v_{0}}{a} = \frac{26.3\ms - 2.50\ms}{4.90\mss} = 4.86\s $$
</div>

**Discussion for (c)**

The answer is somewhat surprising—the final speeds differ by only 0.1 m/s! The running start saves only about 0.5 seconds. However, in very competitive events, even a fraction of a second can mean the difference between winning and losing. Additionally, in actual skiing, friction and air resistance play important roles, and starting with higher speed may provide advantages in maintaining momentum through turns and rough sections of the course. The small difference in final speeds confirms the statement that $$ \Delta \PE \gg \KE_{\text{i}} $$ for the descent.

**Answer**

(a) Starting from rest: final speed = **26.2 m/s**, time = **5.35 s**

(b) Starting with initial speed of 2.50 m/s: final speed = **26.3 m/s**, time = **4.86 s**

(c) The results are surprising because the running start provides only a 0.1 m/s advantage in final speed and saves just 0.5 seconds. However, this time difference can be crucial in competitive racing, and other factors like maintaining momentum through friction and turns also favor a running start.
