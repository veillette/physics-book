* Describe the effects of a magnetic field on a moving charge.
* Calculate the radius of curvature of the path of a charge that is moving in a magnetic field.
</div>

Magnetic force can cause a charged particle to move in a circular or spiral
path. Cosmic rays are energetic charged particles in outer space, some of which
approach the Earth. They can be forced into spiral paths by the Earth’s magnetic
field. Protons in giant accelerators are kept in a circular path by magnetic
force. The bubble chamber photograph in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows charged
particles moving in such curved paths. The curved paths of charged particles in
magnetic fields are the basis of a number of phenomena and can even be used
analytically, such as in a mass spectrometer.

![A drawing representing trails of bubbles in a bubble chamber.](../resources/Figure_22_05_01.jpg 'Trails of bubbles are produced by high-energy charged particles moving through the superheated liquid hydrogen in this artist’s rendition of a bubble chamber. There is a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the page that causes the curved paths of the particles. The radius of the path can be used to find the mass, charge, and energy of the particle.')
{: #Figure1}

So does the magnetic force cause circular motion? Magnetic force is always
perpendicular to velocity, so that it does no work on the charged particle. The
particle’s kinetic energy and speed thus remain constant. The direction of
motion is affected, but not the speed. This is typical of uniform circular
motion. The simplest case occurs when a charged particle moves perpendicular to
a uniform $$B $$ -field, such as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). (If this takes
place in a vacuum, the magnetic field is the dominant factor determining the
motion.) Here, the magnetic force supplies the centripetal force $${F}_{c}=mv^{2}/r $$ . Noting that $$\sin \theta =1 $$ , we see that $$F=qvB $$.

![Diagram showing an electrical charge moving clockwise in the plane of the page. Velocity vectors are tangent to the circular path. The magnetic field B is oriented into the page. Force vectors show that the force on the charge is toward the center of the charge’s circular path as the charge moves.](../resources/Figure_22_05_02.jpg 'A negatively charged particle moves in the plane of the page in a region where the magnetic field is perpendicular into the page (represented by the small circles with x’s—like the tails of arrows). The magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, and so velocity changes in direction but not magnitude. Uniform circular motion results.')
{: #Figure2}

Because the magnetic force $$F $$ supplies the centripetal force $${F}_{c} $$ , we have

<div class="equation" >
 $$qvB=\frac{ mv^{2}}{r}\text{.} $$
</div>

Solving for $$r $$ yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$r=\frac{mv}{qB}\text{.} $$
</div>

Here, $$r $$ is the radius of curvature of the path of a charged particle with
mass $$m $$ and charge $$q $$ , moving at a speed $$v $$ perpendicular to a
magnetic field of strength $$B $$ . If the velocity is not perpendicular to the
magnetic field, then $$v $$ is the component of the velocity perpendicular to
the field. The component of the velocity parallel to the field is unaffected,
since the magnetic force is zero for motion parallel to the field. This produces
a spiral motion rather than a circular one.

Calculating the Curvature of the Path of an Electron Moving in a Magnetic Field: A Magnet on a TV Screen
</div>
A magnet brought near an old-fashioned TV screen such as in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) (TV sets with cathode ray tubes instead of LCD screens) severely distorts its picture by altering the path of the electrons that make its phosphors glow. **(Don’t try this at home, as it will permanently magnetize and ruin the TV.) ** To illustrate this, calculate the radius of curvature of the path of an electron having a velocity of  $$ 6.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{m/s} $$
 (corresponding to the accelerating voltage of about 10.0 kV used in some TVs) perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength  $$B=0.500\text{ T} $$
 (obtainable with permanent magnets).

![A bar magnet with the north pole set against the glass of a computer monitor. The magnetic field lines are shown running from the south pole through the magnet to the north pole. Paths of electrons that are emanating from the computer monitor are shown moving in straight lines until they encounter the magnetic field of the magnet. At that point, they change course and spiral around the magnetic field lines and toward the magnet.](../resources/Figure_22_05_03.jpg 'Side view showing what happens when a magnet comes in contact with a computer monitor or TV screen. Electrons moving toward the screen spiral about magnetic field lines, maintaining the component of their velocity parallel to the field lines. This distorts the image on the screen.')
{: #Figure3}

**Strategy**

We can find the radius of curvature $$r $$ directly from the equation
$$r=\frac{mv}{qB} $$ , since all other quantities in it are given or known.

**Solution**

Using known values for the mass and charge of an electron, along with the given
values of $$v $$ and $$B $$ gives us

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}r=\frac{mv}{qB}& =& \frac{\left( 9.11 \times 10^{-31}  \text{kg}\right)\left( 6.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{m/s}\right)}{\left( 1.60 \times 10^{-19}  \text{C}\right)\left(0.500 \text{T}\right)}\\ & =&  6.83 \times 10^{-4}  \text{m}\end{array} $$
</div>
or

<div class="equation" >
 $$r=0.683 \text{mm}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The small radius indicates a large effect. The electrons in the TV picture tube
are made to move in very tight circles, greatly altering their paths and
distorting the image.

</div>

[[Figure 4]](#Figure4) shows how electrons not moving perpendicular to magnetic
field lines follow the field lines. The component of velocity parallel to the
lines is unaffected, and so the charges spiral along the field lines. If field
strength increases in the direction of motion, the field will exert a force to
slow the charges, forming a kind of magnetic mirror, as shown below.

![Diagram showing charged particles moving with velocity v along magnetic field lines. The velocity vector of a particle is parallel to the field line when it is in a region of weak magnetic field. When it moves into a stronger region, where field lines are denser, the vector is oriented at an angle to the field lines.](../resources/Figure_22_05_04.jpg 'When a charged particle moves along a magnetic field line into a region where the field becomes stronger, the particle experiences a force that reduces the component of velocity parallel to the field. This force slows the motion along the field line and here reverses it, forming a “magnetic mirror.”')
{: #Figure4}

The properties of charged particles in magnetic fields are related to such
different things as the Aurora Australis or Aurora Borealis and particle
accelerators. _Charged particles approaching magnetic field lines may get
trapped in spiral orbits about the lines rather than crossing them_, as seen in
[[Figure 5]](#Figure5). Some cosmic rays, for example, follow the Earth’s magnetic field lines,
entering the atmosphere near the magnetic poles and causing the southern or
northern lights through their ionization of molecules in the atmosphere. This
glow of energized atoms and molecules is seen
in [[Figure 1]](../contents/ch22Magnetism#Figure1). Those particles that approach
middle latitudes must cross magnetic field lines, and many are prevented from
penetrating the atmosphere. Cosmic rays are a component of background radiation;
consequently, they give a higher radiation dose at the poles than at the
equator.

![Diagram of the Earth showing its magnetic field lines running from the south pole, out around the Earth and to the north pole, and then through Earth back to the south pole. Charged particles travel on straight line.](../resources/Figure_22_05_05.jpg 'Energetic electrons and protons, components of cosmic rays, from the Sun and deep outer space often follow the Earth’s magnetic field lines rather than cross them. (Recall that the Earth’s north magnetic pole is really a south pole in terms of a bar magnet.)')
{: #Figure5}

Some incoming charged particles become trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field,
forming two belts above the atmosphere known as the Van Allen radiation belts
after the discoverer James A. Van Allen, an American astrophysicist. (
See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).) Particles trapped in these belts form radiation
fields (similar to nuclear radiation) so intense that manned space flights avoid
them and satellites with sensitive electronics are kept out of them. In the few
minutes it took lunar missions to cross the Van Allen radiation belts,
astronauts received radiation doses more than twice the allowed annual exposure
for radiation workers. Other planets have similar belts, especially those having
strong magnetic fields like Jupiter.

![Diagram showing the Earth with magnetic field lines running from the south pole around to the north pole. A region near the Earth circling the equatorial to mid-latitudes and oriented along a magnetic field line is highlighted and labeled Inner Van Allen radiation belt. A region farther out circles the Earth, except in the polar regions, also following the magnetic field lines, and is labeled Outer Van Allen radiation belt.](../resources/Figure_22_05_06.jpg 'The Van Allen radiation belts are two regions in which energetic charged particles are trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field. One belt lies about 300 km above the Earth’s surface, the other about 16 000 km. Charged particles in these belts migrate along magnetic field lines and are partially reflected away from the poles by the stronger fields there. The charged particles that enter the atmosphere are replenished by the Sun and sources in deep outer space.')
{: #Figure6}

Back on Earth, we have devices that employ magnetic fields to contain charged
particles. Among them are the giant particle accelerators that have been used to
explore the substructure of matter. (See [[Figure 7]](#Figure7).) Magnetic
fields not only control the direction of the charged particles, they also are
used to focus particles into beams and overcome the repulsion of like charges in
these beams.

![A view of a section of the accelerator at Fermilab. Down each side of a long corridor are tubes surrounded by orange magnets. Lots of tubes and wires and other electronics are visible.](../resources/Figure_22_05_07.jpg 'The Fermilab facility in Illinois has a large particle accelerator (the most powerful in the world until 2008) that employs magnetic fields (magnets seen here in orange) to contain and direct its beam. This and other accelerators have been in use for several decades and have allowed us to discover some of the laws underlying all matter. (credit: ammcrim, Flickr)')
{: #Figure7}

Thermonuclear fusion (like that occurring in the Sun) is a hope for a future
clean energy source. One of the most promising devices is the _tokamak_, which
uses magnetic fields to contain (or trap) and direct the reactive charged
particles. (See [[Figure 8]](#Figure8).) Less exotic, but more immediately
practical, amplifiers in microwave ovens use a magnetic field to contain
oscillating electrons. These oscillating electrons generate the microwaves sent
into the oven.

![Figure a shows a tokamak in a lab. Figure b is a diagram of a tokamak. A current-carrying wire wraps around a donut-shaped vacuum chamber. Inside the chamber is plasma. The magnetic field has a toroidal and poloidal shape inside the chamber.](../resources/Figure_22_05_08.jpg 'Tokamaks such as the one shown in the figure are being studied with the goal of economical production of energy by nuclear fusion. Magnetic fields in the doughnut-shaped device contain and direct the reactive charged particles. (credit: David Mellis, Flickr)')
{: #Figure8}

Mass spectrometers have a variety of designs, and many use magnetic fields to
measure mass. The curvature of a charged particle’s path in the field is related
to its mass and is measured to obtain mass information. (
See [More Applications of Magnetism](../contents/ch22MoreApplicationsOfMagnetism).)
Historically, such techniques were employed in the first direct observations of
electron charge and mass. Today, mass spectrometers (sometimes coupled with gas
chromatographs) are used to determine the make-up and sequencing of large
biological molecules.

A cosmic ray electron moves at  $$ 7.50 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s} $$
 perpendicular to the Earth’s magnetic field at an altitude where field strength is  $$ 1.00 \times 10^{-5}   T $$ .
 What is the radius of the circular path the electron follows?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When a charged particle moves perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force for circular motion. We equate the magnetic force $$F = qvB$$ to the centripetal force $$F_c = mv^2/r$$ and solve for the radius $$r = mv/(qB)$$.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Electron speed: $$v = 7.50 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field strength: $$B = 1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge: $$|q| = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

*Unknown:* Radius $$r$$

Using the circular motion radius formula:

$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

$$r = \frac{(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(7.50 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s})}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T})}$$

$$r = \frac{6.83 \times 10^{-24} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.60 \times 10^{-24} \text{ C·T}}$$

$$r = 4.27 \text{ m}$$

**Discussion**

This radius of about 4.3 meters is quite large—much larger than what we'd observe in a laboratory setting with stronger magnets. This is because Earth's magnetic field at high altitude (where the problem specifies $$B = 1.00 \times 10^{-5}$$ T, weaker than at the surface) is relatively weak. Cosmic ray electrons indeed follow curved paths of this scale in Earth's magnetic field, which is part of how they become trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. In particle physics laboratories, much stronger fields (1-10 T) are used to bend particle paths into tight curves for detection.

**The radius of the electron's circular path is 4.27 m.**

A proton moves at  $$ 7.50 \times 10^{7}  \text{m/s} $$
 perpendicular to a magnetic field. The field causes the proton to travel in a circular path of radius 0.800 m. What is the field strength?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the same relationship between radius, velocity, charge, mass, and magnetic field: $$r = mv/(qB)$$. Here we know the radius and velocity and need to solve for the magnetic field strength $$B$$.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Proton speed: $$v = 7.50 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$$
- Radius of circular path: $$r = 0.800 \text{ m}$$
- Proton mass: $$m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$$
- Proton charge: $$q = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

*Unknown:* Magnetic field strength $$B$$

From $$r = mv/(qB)$$, solving for $$B$$:

$$B = \frac{mv}{qr}$$

$$B = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg})(7.50 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(0.800 \text{ m})}$$

$$B = \frac{1.25 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.28 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·m}}$$

$$B = 0.977 \text{ T} \approx 0.98 \text{ T}$$

**Discussion**

A field strength just under 1 T is readily achievable with modern permanent magnets or electromagnets. The proton is moving at 25% of the speed of light, which is very fast but not so fast that relativistic corrections are essential (though they would improve accuracy). This type of setup—high-speed protons in a strong magnetic field—is the basis of cyclotrons and synchrotrons used in particle physics and medical proton therapy.

**The magnetic field strength is 0.977 T (approximately 0.98 T).**

(a) Viewers of *Star Trek* hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship *Enterprise*. One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store antimatter charged particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, and then extract them as needed. Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy. What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons, moving at  $$ 5.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{m/s} $$
 in a circular path 2.00 m in radius? Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but the opposite (negative) charge. (b) Is this field strength obtainable with today’s technology or is it a futuristic possibility?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but opposite (negative) charge. The magnitude of the charge is still $$e$$. We use $$r = mv/(|q|B)$$ and solve for $$B$$. For part (b), we compare the required field strength to what can be achieved with current technology.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Antiproton speed: $$v = 5.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$$
- Desired radius: $$r = 2.00 \text{ m}$$
- Antiproton mass: $$m = m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$$ (same as proton)
- Antiproton charge magnitude: $$|q| = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a) Required magnetic field:**

$$B = \frac{mv}{|q|r}$$

$$B = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg})(5.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(2.00 \text{ m})}$$

$$B = \frac{8.35 \times 10^{-20} \text{ kg·m/s}}{3.20 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·m}}$$

$$B = 0.261 \text{ T}$$

**(b) Technological feasibility:**

A field of 0.261 T is easily achievable with today's technology:
- Good permanent magnets (neodymium): 0.5–1.5 T
- Standard laboratory electromagnets: 1–2 T
- Superconducting magnets: up to 20+ T

This is well within the capabilities of even relatively inexpensive magnets.

**Discussion**

Antimatter storage is actually done at facilities like CERN, where antiprotons and positrons are stored in magnetic "bottles" called Penning traps and storage rings. The challenge isn't the magnetic field strength but rather maintaining the ultra-high vacuum needed to prevent annihilation with residual gas molecules, and the difficulty of producing significant quantities of antimatter in the first place. The curvature direction for antiprotons would be opposite to protons in the same field because of their negative charge.

**(a) The required magnetic field strength is 0.261 T.**

**(b) This field strength is readily obtainable with current technology. Even permanent magnets can produce fields of 0.5 T or more, so containing antiprotons magnetically is technologically feasible today.**

(a) An oxygen-16 ion with a mass of  $$ 2.66 \times 10^{-26}  \text{kg} $$

 perpendicular to a 1.20-T magnetic field, which makes it move in a circular arc with a 0.231-m radius. What positive charge is on the ion? (b) What is the ratio of this charge to the charge of an electron? (c) Discuss why the ratio found in (b) should be an integer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the circular motion equation $$r = mv/(qB)$$ and solve for the charge $$q$$. Then we compare this charge to the elementary charge to find the ionization state.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Ion mass: $$m = 2.66 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg}$$
- Ion speed: $$v = 5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 1.20 \text{ T}$$
- Radius: $$r = 0.231 \text{ m}$$
- Elementary charge: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a) Charge on the ion:**

From $$r = mv/(qB)$$, solving for $$q$$:

$$q = \frac{mv}{rB}$$

$$q = \frac{(2.66 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg})(5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s})}{(0.231 \text{ m})(1.20 \text{ T})}$$

$$q = \frac{1.33 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}}{0.277 \text{ m·T}}$$

$$q = 4.80 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(b) Ratio to electron charge:**

$$\frac{q}{e} = \frac{4.80 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}} = 3.00$$

**(c) Why the ratio should be an integer:**

Electric charge is quantized—it comes only in integer multiples of the elementary charge $$e$$. This is because charge carriers are discrete particles:
- Removing 1 electron from a neutral atom gives charge +1e
- Removing 2 electrons gives charge +2e
- Removing 3 electrons gives charge +3e

The oxygen-16 ion has lost 3 electrons, making it O$$^{3+}$$ (triply ionized oxygen). Fractional charges are not observed for isolated particles in nature. The slight deviation from exactly 3.00 in calculations is due to rounding in the given values.

**Discussion**

Mass spectrometers exploit this quantization of charge. Since $$r \propto m/q$$, ions with different charge states will follow different radii, allowing them to be separated. The O$$^{3+}$$ ion would follow a different path than O$$^{2+}$$ or O$$^{+}$$ in the same field, even though they have the same mass.

**(a) The charge on the ion is $$4.80 \times 10^{-19}$$ C.**

**(b) The ratio of this charge to the electron charge is 3.00 (the ion is triply ionized: O$$^{3+}$$).**

**(c) The ratio must be an integer because electric charge is quantized—charges exist only in integer multiples of the elementary charge $$e$$, corresponding to the number of electrons removed from or added to an atom.**

What radius circular path does an electron travel if it moves at the same speed and in the same magnetic field as the proton in [[Exercise2]](#Exercise2)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The radius of circular motion is $$r = mv/(qB)$$. Since the electron has the same charge magnitude as the proton but much smaller mass (about 1/1836 of the proton mass), it will travel in a much smaller circle at the same speed and in the same field.

**Solution**

*Known quantities (from Exercise 2):*
- Speed: $$v = 7.50 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 0.977 \text{ T}$$ (calculated in Exercise 2)
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge magnitude: $$|q| = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

$$r_e = \frac{m_e v}{|q|B}$$

$$r_e = \frac{(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(7.50 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(0.977 \text{ T})}$$

$$r_e = \frac{6.83 \times 10^{-23} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.56 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·T}}$$

$$r_e = 4.38 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} = 0.438 \text{ mm}$$

**Discussion**

The electron's radius is about 1836 times smaller than the proton's 0.800 m radius. This ratio equals the proton-to-electron mass ratio, which makes sense since $$r \propto m$$ when $$v$$, $$q$$, and $$B$$ are the same. This dramatic difference in path radius is exploited in mass spectrometers to separate particles by mass. The electron's tiny radius (less than half a millimeter) would require very precise measurement to detect the curvature.

A velocity selector in a mass spectrometer uses a 0.100-T magnetic field. (a) What electric field strength is needed to select a speed of  $$ 4.00 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s} $$ ?
 (b) What is the voltage between the plates if they are separated by 1.00 cm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A velocity selector uses crossed electric and magnetic fields. Charged particles experience both forces, but only those with a specific velocity travel straight through—when the electric force equals the magnetic force: $$qE = qvB$$. This gives the selection condition $$v = E/B$$. The voltage is then found from $$V = Ed$$ for a uniform field between parallel plates.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Magnetic field: $$B = 0.100 \text{ T}$$
- Selected speed: $$v = 4.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
- Plate separation: $$d = 1.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0100 \text{ m}$$

**(a) Electric field strength:**

From the velocity selector condition $$v = E/B$$:

$$E = vB$$

$$E = (4.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s})(0.100 \text{ T})$$

$$E = 4.00 \times 10^{5} \text{ V/m} = 400 \text{ kV/m}$$

**(b) Voltage between plates:**

$$V = Ed$$

$$V = (4.00 \times 10^{5} \text{ V/m})(0.0100 \text{ m})$$

$$V = 4.00 \times 10^{3} \text{ V} = 4.00 \text{ kV}$$

**Discussion**

The velocity selector is a crucial component of mass spectrometers because it ensures all ions entering the magnetic separation region have the same speed. Without this, particles with different speeds but the same mass-to-charge ratio would follow different paths, reducing the resolution of the instrument. A voltage of 4 kV across a 1 cm gap is substantial but manageable in laboratory settings. Note that the selection condition is independent of the charge and mass of the particles—only their velocity determines whether they pass through undeflected.

**(a) The electric field strength needed is $$4.00 \times 10^{5}$$ V/m (400 kV/m).**

**(b) The voltage between the plates is 4.00 kV (4000 V).**

An electron in a TV CRT moves with a speed of  $$ 6.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{m/s} $$ ,
 in a direction perpendicular to the Earth’s field, which has a strength of  $$ 5.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{T} $$ .
 (a) What strength electric field must be applied perpendicular to the Earth’s field to make the electron moves in a straight line? (b) If this is done between plates separated by 1.00 cm, what is the voltage applied? (Note that TVs are usually surrounded by a ferromagnetic material to shield against external magnetic fields and avoid the need for such a correction.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is similar to the velocity selector problem. To make the electron travel in a straight line, the electric force must balance the magnetic force: $$eE = evB$$, giving $$E = vB$$. The voltage is then $$V = Ed$$.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Electron speed: $$v = 6.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s}$$
- Earth's magnetic field: $$B = 5.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$
- Plate separation: $$d = 1.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0100 \text{ m}$$

**(a) Electric field strength:**

For the electron to travel in a straight line, the electric force must equal the magnetic force:

$$E = vB$$

$$E = (6.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})(5.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T})$$

$$E = 3.00 \times 10^{3} \text{ V/m} = 3.00 \text{ kV/m}$$

**(b) Voltage between plates:**

$$V = Ed$$

$$V = (3.00 \times 10^{3} \text{ V/m})(0.0100 \text{ m})$$

$$V = 30.0 \text{ V}$$

**Discussion**

This relatively modest voltage of 30 V (less than that of a typical laptop charger) would be needed to counteract Earth's magnetic field effect on the electron beam. However, TVs were typically surrounded by ferromagnetic shielding (mu-metal) to reduce the influence of external magnetic fields, making this correction unnecessary in practice. The shielding approach is more practical than actively applying correcting fields, especially since Earth's field direction varies with the TV's orientation.

**(a) The electric field strength needed is 3.00 kV/m (3000 V/m).**

**(b) The voltage between the plates is 30.0 V.**

(a) At what speed will a proton move in a circular path of the same radius as the electron in [[Exercise1]](#Exercise1)? (b) What would the radius of the path be if the proton had the same speed as the electron? (c) What would the radius be if the proton had the same kinetic energy as the electron? (d) The same momentum?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use $$r = mv/(qB)$$ for all parts. For particles with the same charge magnitude, the radius depends on the mass-velocity product (momentum). We'll compare the proton and electron under different conditions specified in each part.

**Solution**

*Reference values from Exercise 1:*
- Electron speed: $$v_e = 7.50 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
- Electron radius: $$r_e = 4.27 \text{ m}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$
- Mass ratio: $$m_p/m_e = 1836$$

**(a) Proton speed for same radius:**

For the same radius with $$r = mv/(qB)$$ and same $$q$$ and $$B$$:

$$\frac{r_p}{r_e} = \frac{m_p v_p}{m_e v_e}$$

For $$r_p = r_e$$:

$$v_p = v_e \frac{m_e}{m_p} = (7.50 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}) \times \frac{1}{1836}$$

$$v_p = 4.08 \times 10^{3} \text{ m/s}$$

**(b) Proton radius at same speed:**

$$r_p = r_e \times \frac{m_p}{m_e} = 4.27 \text{ m} \times 1836 = 7840 \text{ m} = 7.84 \text{ km}$$

**(c) Proton radius at same kinetic energy:**

If $$\frac{1}{2}m_p v_p^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_e v_e^2$$, then $$v_p = v_e\sqrt{m_e/m_p}$$

$$r_p = \frac{m_p v_p}{qB} = \frac{m_p v_e \sqrt{m_e/m_p}}{qB} = r_e \times \frac{m_p}{m_e}\sqrt{\frac{m_e}{m_p}} = r_e\sqrt{\frac{m_p}{m_e}}$$

$$r_p = 4.27 \text{ m} \times \sqrt{1836} = 4.27 \times 42.8 = 183 \text{ m}$$

**(d) Proton radius at same momentum:**

If $$m_p v_p = m_e v_e$$, then $$v_p = v_e(m_e/m_p)$$

$$r_p = \frac{m_p v_p}{qB} = \frac{m_p \cdot v_e(m_e/m_p)}{qB} = \frac{m_e v_e}{qB} = r_e$$

$$r_p = 4.27 \text{ m}$$

**Discussion**

These results reveal important physics:
- Part (d) shows that particles with the same momentum follow the same radius—this is because $$r = p/(qB)$$ where $$p = mv$$ is momentum.
- Part (c) shows that at the same kinetic energy, the heavier proton has a larger radius by a factor of $$\sqrt{m_p/m_e} \approx 43$$.
- Part (b) shows that at the same speed, the radius scales directly with mass.

**(a) The proton speed would be $$4.08 \times 10^{3}$$ m/s (about 4 km/s).**

**(b) The proton radius would be 7.84 km (7840 m).**

**(c) The proton radius with equal kinetic energy would be 183 m.**

**(d) The proton radius with equal momentum would be 4.27 m (same as the electron).**

A mass spectrometer is being used to separate common oxygen-16 from the much rarer oxygen-18, taken from a sample of old glacial ice. (The relative abundance of these oxygen isotopes is related to climatic temperature at the time the ice was deposited.) The ratio of the masses of these two ions is 16 to 18, the mass of oxygen-16 is  $$ 2.66 \times 10^{-26}  \text{kg}, $$
 and they are singly charged and travel at  $$ 5.00 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s} $$
 in a 1.20-T magnetic field. What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

In a mass spectrometer, ions with the same charge and velocity but different masses follow circular paths with different radii. Since $$r = mv/(qB)$$, heavier ions follow larger-radius paths. After a semicircle, ions are separated by the difference in their diameters: separation = $$2(r_{18} - r_{16})$$.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Mass of O-16: $$m_{16} = 2.66 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg}$$
- Mass ratio: $$m_{18}/m_{16} = 18/16$$, so $$m_{18} = 2.66 \times 10^{-26} \times (18/16) = 2.99 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg}$$
- Speed: $$v = 5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 1.20 \text{ T}$$
- Charge: $$q = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$ (singly charged)

*Calculate the radii:*

$$r_{16} = \frac{m_{16}v}{qB} = \frac{(2.66 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg})(5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s})}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(1.20 \text{ T})}$$

$$r_{16} = \frac{1.33 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.92 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·T}} = 0.693 \text{ m}$$

$$r_{18} = r_{16} \times \frac{m_{18}}{m_{16}} = 0.693 \times \frac{18}{16} = 0.780 \text{ m}$$

*Separation after semicircle:*

$$\text{Separation} = 2(r_{18} - r_{16}) = 2(0.780 - 0.693) = 2(0.0866) = 0.173 \text{ m}$$

**Discussion**

The separation of 17.3 cm is quite large and easily measurable. This is why mass spectrometry can distinguish isotopes with high precision. The key factor is the mass difference (12.5% between O-16 and O-18), which produces a proportional difference in radius. Paleoclimatologists use oxygen isotope ratios in ice cores to reconstruct ancient temperatures because the ratio of O-18 to O-16 in precipitation varies with temperature.

**The separation between the oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 paths is 0.173 m (17.3 cm).**

(a) Triply charged uranium-235 and uranium-238 ions are being separated in a mass spectrometer. (The much rarer uranium-235 is used as reactor fuel.) The masses of the ions are  $$ 3.90 \times 10^{-25}  \text{kg} $$
 and  $$ 3.95 \times 10^{-25}  \text{kg} $$ ,
 respectively, and they travel at  $$ 3.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{m/s} $$
 in a 0.250-T field. What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle? (b) Discuss whether this distance between their paths seems to be big enough to be practical in the separation of uranium-235 from uranium-238.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is similar to the oxygen isotope problem, but with triply charged ions ($$q = 3e$$) and heavier masses. We calculate the radius for each isotope using $$r = mv/(qB)$$, then find the separation as the difference in diameters.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Mass of U-235: $$m_{235} = 3.90 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg}$$
- Mass of U-238: $$m_{238} = 3.95 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg}$$
- Speed: $$v = 3.00 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 0.250 \text{ T}$$
- Charge: $$q = 3e = 3(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) = 4.80 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a) Calculate the radii:**

$$r_{235} = \frac{m_{235}v}{qB} = \frac{(3.90 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg})(3.00 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s})}{(4.80 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(0.250 \text{ T})}$$

$$r_{235} = \frac{1.17 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.20 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·T}} = 0.975 \text{ m}$$

$$r_{238} = \frac{m_{238}v}{qB} = \frac{(3.95 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg})(3.00 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s})}{(4.80 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(0.250 \text{ T})}$$

$$r_{238} = \frac{1.185 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}}{1.20 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C·T}} = 0.988 \text{ m}$$

*Separation after semicircle:*

$$\text{Separation} = 2(r_{238} - r_{235}) = 2(0.988 - 0.975) = 2(0.0125) = 0.025 \text{ m} = 2.5 \text{ cm}$$

**(b) Practical considerations:**

A separation of 2.5 cm is large enough to be practical for separating uranium isotopes. This is detectable and sufficient for directing the ion beams into separate collectors. However, several challenges make large-scale separation difficult:

- The mass difference between U-235 and U-238 is only about 1.3%, requiring precision equipment
- High throughput is needed since natural uranium is only 0.7% U-235
- Multiple passes through the separator increase enrichment level
- The process is energy-intensive and slow

During World War II, electromagnetic separation (calutrons) using this principle was one method used to enrich uranium for the first atomic bombs at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Today, gas centrifuge technology is more efficient for large-scale enrichment.

**Discussion**

The small mass difference between U-235 and U-238 (compared to oxygen isotopes) results in smaller separation. However, 2.5 cm is still workable with precision engineering. Modern mass spectrometers can resolve mass differences much smaller than this.

**(a) The separation between U-235 and U-238 paths is 0.025 m (2.5 cm).**

**(b) Yes, 2.5 cm is large enough to be practical for isotope separation. While challenging, electromagnetic separation was historically used to enrich uranium, and this separation distance is sufficient for collecting the isotopes separately.**
