What is the mechanism by which one magnet exerts a force on another? The answer
is related to the fact that all magnetism is caused by current, the flow of
charge. _Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges_, and so they exert
forces on other magnets, all of which have moving charges.

### Right Hand Rule 1

The magnetic force on a moving charge is one of the most fundamental known.
Magnetic force is as important as the electrostatic or Coulomb force. Yet the
magnetic force is more complex, in both the number of factors that affects it
and in its direction, than the relatively simple Coulomb force. The magnitude of
the **magnetic force** $$\mag{F} $$ on a charge $$q $$ moving at a velocity $$\vb{v} $$ in a
magnetic field of strength $$\vb{B} $$ is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\mag{F}=q \mag{v} \mag{B} \sin \theta \text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\theta $$ is the angle between the directions of $$\vb{v} $$
and $$\vb{B}. $$ This force is often called the **Lorentz force**. In fact, this is how we define the magnetic field strength $$\mag{B} $$
—in terms of the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. The SI
unit for magnetic field strength $$B $$ is called the **tesla** (T) after the eccentric but brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla (1856–1943). To
determine how the tesla relates to other SI units, we solve $$\mag{F}=q\mag{v}\mag{B} \sin \theta
$$ for $$\mag{B} $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\mag{B}=\frac{\mag{F}}{q\mag{v} \sin \theta } $$
</div>

Because $$\sin \theta $$ is unitless, the tesla is

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{T}=\frac{1 \text{N}}{\text{C}\cdot \text{m/s}}=\frac{1 \text{N}}{\text{A}\cdot \text{m}} $$
</div>

(note that C/s = A).

Another smaller unit, called the **gauss** (G), where $$1 G=10^{-4} \text{T} $$
, is sometimes used. The strongest permanent magnets have fields near 2 T;
superconducting electromagnets may attain 10 T or more. The Earth’s magnetic
field on its surface is only about $$5 \times 10^{-5} \text{T} $$ , or 0.5 G.

The _direction_ of the magnetic force $$\vb{F} $$ is perpendicular to
the plane formed by $$\vb{v} $$ and $$\vb{B} $$ , as
determined by the **right hand rule 1** (or RHR-1), which is
illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). RHR-1 states that, to determine the
direction of the magnetic force on a positive moving charge, you point the thumb
of the right hand in the direction of $$\vb{v} $$ , the fingers in
the direction of $$\vb{B} $$ , and a perpendicular to the palm points
in the direction of $$\vb{F} $$ . One way to remember this is that
there is one velocity, and so the thumb represents it. There are many field
lines, and so the fingers represent them. The force is in the direction you
would push with your palm. The force on a negative charge is in exactly the
opposite direction to that on a positive charge.

![The right hand rule 1. An outstretched right hand rests palm up on a piece of paper on which a vector arrow v points to the right and a vector arrow B points toward the top of the paper. The thumb points to the right, in the direction of the v vector arrow. The fingers point in the direction of the B vector. B and v are in the same plane. The F vector points straight up, perpendicular to the plane of the paper, which is the plane made by B and v. The angle between B and v is theta. The magnitude of the magnetic force F equals q v B sine theta.](../resources/Figure_22_04_01.jpg 'Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges. This force is one of the most basic known. The direction of the magnetic force on a moving charge is perpendicular to the plane formed by v and ( B ) and follows right hand rule–1 (RHR-1) as shown. The magnitude of the force is proportional to ( q ) , ( v ) , ( B ) , and the sine of the angle between ( v ) and ( B ) .')

Making Connections: Charges and Magnets
</div>
There is no magnetic force on static charges. However, there is a magnetic force on moving charges. When charges are stationary, their electric fields do not affect magnets. But, when charges move, they produce magnetic fields that exert forces on other magnets. When there is relative motion, a connection between electric and magnetic fields emerges—each affects the other.

Calculating Magnetic Force: Earth’s Magnetic Field on a Charged Glass Rod
</div>
With the exception of compasses, you seldom see or personally experience forces due to the Earth’s small magnetic field. To illustrate this, suppose that in a physics lab you rub a glass rod with silk, placing a 20-nC positive charge on it. Calculate the force on the rod due to the Earth’s magnetic field, if you throw it with a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s due west in a place where the Earth’s field is due north parallel to the ground. (The direction of the force is determined with right hand rule 1 as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

![The effects of the Earth’s magnetic field on moving charges. Figure a shows a positive charge with a velocity vector due west, a magnetic field line B oriented due north, and a magnetic force vector F straight down. Figure b shows the right hand facing down, with the fingers pointing north with B, the thumb pointing west with v, and force down away from the hand.](../resources/Figure_22_04_02.jpg 'A positively charged object moving due west in a region where the Earth’s magnetic field is due north experiences a force that is straight down as shown. A negative charge moving in the same direction would feel a force straight up.')
{: #Figure2}

**Strategy**

We are given the charge, its velocity, and the magnetic field strength and
direction. We can thus use the equation $$F=qvB \sin \theta $$ to find the
force.

**Solution**

The magnetic force is

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=q v B \sin \theta . $$
</div>
We see that  $$\sin \theta =1 $$ ,
 since the angle between the velocity and the direction of the field is  $$90 ^\circ $$ .
 Entering the other given quantities yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}F& =& \left(20 \times 10^{-9} \text{C}\right)\left(10 \text{m/s}\right)\left(5 \times 10^{-5} \text{T} \right)\\ & =& 1 \times 10^{-11} \left( \text{C}\cdot \text{m/s}\right)\left(\frac{N}{ \text{C}\cdot \text{m/s}}\right)=1 \times 10^{-11} \text{N}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This force is completely negligible on any macroscopic object, consistent with
experience. (It is calculated to only one digit, since the Earth’s field varies
with location and is given to only one digit.) The Earth’s magnetic field,
however, does produce very important effects, particularly on submicroscopic
particles. Some of these are explored
in [Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field: Examples and Applications](../contents/ch22ForceOnAMovingChargeInAMagneticField) .

### Section Summary

- Magnetic fields exert a force on a moving charge _q_, the magnitude of which
  is
  <div class="equation" >
   $$F=qvB \sin \theta , $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\theta  $$ is the angle between the directions of    $$v $$ and    $$B $$ .

- The SI unit for magnetic field strength $$B $$ is the tesla (T), which is
  related to other units by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$1 \text{T}=\frac{1 \text{N}}{\text{C} \cdot \text{m/s}}=\frac{1 \text{N}}{\text{A}\cdot \text{m}}. $$
  </div>

- The _direction_ of the force on a moving charge is given by right hand rule
  1 (RHR-1): Point the thumb of the right hand in the direction of $$\vb{v} $$ , the
  fingers in the direction of $$\vb{B} $$ , and a perpendicular to the palm points in
  the direction of $$\vb{F} $$ .
- The force is perpendicular to the plane formed by $$\vb{v} $$ and
  $$\vb{B} $$ . Since the force is zero if $$\vb{v} $$ is
  parallel to $$\vb{B} $$ , charged particles often follow magnetic
  field lines rather than cross them.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the right hand rule 1 (RHR-1) to determine the direction of the magnetic force on a positive moving charge. Point the thumb in the direction of velocity $$\vb{v}$$, the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field $$\vb{B}$$, and the palm pushes in the direction of the force $$\vb{F}$$. We apply this to each scenario, noting the orientations of $$\vb{v}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$ given in the figure.

**Solution**

**(a)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points down, $$\vb{B}$$ points out of the page. Using RHR-1: thumb down, fingers out of page → palm pushes **left (West)**.

**(b)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points up, $$\vb{B}$$ points right. Using RHR-1: thumb up, fingers right → palm pushes **into the page**.

**(c)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points right, $$\vb{B}$$ points into the page. Using RHR-1: thumb right, fingers into page → palm pushes **up (North)**.

**(d)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points left, $$\vb{B}$$ points right. The velocity is antiparallel to the magnetic field, so $$\theta = 180°$$ and $$\sin\theta = 0$$. Therefore, there is **no force**.

**(e)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points into the page, $$\vb{B}$$ points up. Using RHR-1: thumb into page, fingers up → palm pushes **right (East)**.

**(f)** Velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points out of the page, $$\vb{B}$$ points left. Using RHR-1: thumb out of page, fingers left → palm pushes **down (South)**.

**Discussion**

The magnetic force is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. When $$\vb{v}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$ are parallel or antiparallel (as in case d), the cross product is zero and there is no magnetic force. This is why charged particles can travel along magnetic field lines without being deflected—only the component of velocity perpendicular to the field produces a force.

Repeat the above [[Exercise]](#Exercise1) for a negative charge.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a negative charge, the magnetic force is in the opposite direction compared to a positive charge. We can either apply RHR-1 and then reverse the direction, or use a "left hand rule" where the thumb points in the direction of velocity, fingers point in the direction of $$\vb{B}$$, and the palm pushes in the direction of force on the negative charge.

**Solution**

Since the force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a positive charge in the same situation, we simply reverse each answer from Exercise 1:

**(a)** Force on positive charge was left → Force on negative charge is **right (East)**.

**(b)** Force on positive charge was into page → Force on negative charge is **out of the page**.

**(c)** Force on positive charge was up → Force on negative charge is **down (South)**.

**(d)** There was no force on the positive charge → There is still **no force** on the negative charge (since $$\sin\theta = 0$$).

**(e)** Force on positive charge was right → Force on negative charge is **left (West)**.

**(f)** Force on positive charge was down → Force on negative charge is **up (North)**.

**Discussion**

The reversal of force direction for negative charges is fundamental to understanding phenomena like the Hall effect, where electrons and positive charge carriers deflect in opposite directions in a magnetic field. This difference allows us to determine the sign of charge carriers in conductors. Note that in case (d), the zero force remains zero regardless of charge sign because it depends on $$\sin\theta$$, not on the charge sign.

What is the direction of the velocity of a negative charge that experiences the magnetic force shown in each of the three cases in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), assuming it moves perpendicular to  $$\vb{B}$$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a negative charge, the force is opposite to what RHR-1 predicts. We can work backwards: if we know $$\vb{F}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$, we can find $$\vb{v}$$ by reversing the logic. For a negative charge, we point fingers in the direction of $$\vb{B}$$, and the palm faces opposite to $$\vb{F}$$ (since force on negative charge is reversed). The thumb then points in the direction of $$\vb{v}$$.

**Solution**

**(a)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, $$\vb{B}$$ points out of the page. For a negative charge, the actual magnetic force equation gives $$\vb{F}$$ opposite to $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$. Working backwards with $$\vb{B}$$ out of page and needing force up (opposite to $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ pointing down), we need $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ pointing down. With $$\vb{B}$$ out of page, velocity must point **East (right)**.

**(b)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, $$\vb{B}$$ points right. For the negative charge to experience an upward force, $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ must point down. With $$\vb{B}$$ pointing right, velocity must be **into the page**.

**(c)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points left, $$\vb{B}$$ points into the page. For the negative charge to experience a leftward force, $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ must point right. With $$\vb{B}$$ into the page, velocity must point **South (down)**.

**Discussion**

Working backwards from force to velocity requires careful application of the right hand rule in reverse. Remember that for negative charges, the actual force is opposite to $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$. This inverse problem-solving skill is useful in analyzing particle trajectories in bubble chambers and mass spectrometers, where we observe the curved paths and must deduce properties of the particles.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a positive charge, the force direction follows directly from RHR-1: $$\vb{F} = q\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$. Working backwards, given $$\vb{F}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$, we find $$\vb{v}$$ by requiring that the cross product $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ points in the same direction as $$\vb{F}$$.

**Solution**

Since positive charges experience force in the direction of $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$, and negative charges experience force opposite to $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$, the velocity for a positive charge must be opposite to that found for a negative charge with the same force direction:

**(a)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, $$\vb{B}$$ points out of the page. For $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ to point up with $$\vb{B}$$ out of page, velocity must point **West (left)**.

**(b)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, $$\vb{B}$$ points right. For $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ to point up with $$\vb{B}$$ right, velocity must be **out of the page**.

**(c)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points left, $$\vb{B}$$ points into the page. For $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ to point left with $$\vb{B}$$ into page, velocity must point **North (up)**.

**Discussion**

Comparing the answers for positive and negative charges (Exercise 3 vs. Exercise 4), we see that they move in exactly opposite directions to produce the same force direction. This is a direct consequence of the sign difference in the Lorentz force law. In particle physics experiments, observing the direction of deflection in a known magnetic field immediately tells us the sign of the charge.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a positive charge, $$\vb{F} = q\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$, and the force is in the direction of the cross product. Given $$\vb{F}$$ and $$\vb{v}$$, we need to find $$\vb{B}$$ such that $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ points in the direction of $$\vb{F}$$. Using RHR-1 in reverse: with thumb along $$\vb{v}$$ and palm facing $$\vb{F}$$, fingers point in the direction of $$\vb{B}$$.

**Solution**

**(a)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points left, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points up. Using RHR-1: thumb up ($$\vb{v}$$), palm faces left ($$\vb{F}$$), so fingers point **into the page**. Thus $$\vb{B}$$ is into the page.

**(b)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points into the page, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points down. Using RHR-1: thumb down ($$\vb{v}$$), palm faces into page ($$\vb{F}$$), so fingers point **West (left)**. Thus $$\vb{B}$$ is to the left.

**(c)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points left. Using RHR-1: thumb left ($$\vb{v}$$), palm faces up ($$\vb{F}$$), so fingers point **out of the page**. Thus $$\vb{B}$$ is out of the page.

**Discussion**

This type of problem—finding the magnetic field direction from known force and velocity—is important for understanding how magnetic field measurements are made. By observing how charged particles deflect in an unknown field, we can map out the field direction. This principle underlies how cosmic ray detectors and magnetic field probes work.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a negative charge, the force is opposite to $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$. So if we observe a force $$\vb{F}$$ on a negative charge, then $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ points in the direction of $$-\vb{F}$$. We use RHR-1 with the force direction reversed.

**Solution**

For each case, the magnetic field direction for a negative charge will be opposite to that for a positive charge experiencing the same force:

**(a)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points left, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points up. For a negative charge, $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ must point right (opposite to $$\vb{F}$$). With thumb up and palm facing right, fingers point **out of the page**.

**(b)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points into the page, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points down. For a negative charge, $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ must point out of the page. With thumb down and palm facing out of page, fingers point **East (right)**.

**(c)** Force $$\vb{F}$$ points up, velocity $$\vb{v}$$ points left. For a negative charge, $$\vb{v} \times \vb{B}$$ must point down. With thumb left and palm facing down, fingers point **into the page**.

**Discussion**

The reversal of $$\vb{B}$$ direction for opposite charge signs (with the same $$\vb{F}$$ and $$\vb{v}$$) is a mathematical consequence of the Lorentz force law. In practice, if you don't know the sign of the charge, you cannot uniquely determine $$\vb{B}$$ from a single observation of force and velocity—you need additional information about the particle.

What is the maximum force on an aluminum rod with a  $$ 0.100\text{-μC} $$
 charge that you pass between the poles of a 1.50-T permanent magnet at a speed of 5.00 m/s? In what direction is the force?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by $$F = qvB\sin\theta$$. The maximum force occurs when the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field ($$\theta = 90°$$, so $$\sin\theta = 1$$). The direction of the force is perpendicular to both $$\vb{v}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$, as determined by RHR-1.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Charge: $$q = 0.100 \text{ μC} = 0.100 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C} = 1.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C}$$
- Speed: $$v = 5.00 \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field strength: $$B = 1.50 \text{ T}$$

*Unknown:* Maximum force $$F_{\text{max}}$$

The maximum force occurs when $$\sin\theta = 1$$:

$$F_{\text{max}} = qvB$$

$$F_{\text{max}} = (1.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C})(5.00 \text{ m/s})(1.50 \text{ T})$$

$$F_{\text{max}} = 7.50 \times 10^{-7} \text{ N}$$

The direction is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, as determined by RHR-1.

**Discussion**

This force of about 0.75 μN is extremely small—far too weak to be felt or to have any practical effect on the aluminum rod. For comparison, the weight of a single grain of sand is about $$10^{-5}$$ N, roughly 10 times larger than this magnetic force. However, this small force is detectable with sensitive instruments and becomes significant when dealing with very strong magnets or highly charged objects moving at high speeds.

**The maximum force is $$7.50 \times 10^{-7}$$ N, directed perpendicular to both the magnetic field lines and the velocity.**

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the Lorentz force equation $$F = qvB\sin\theta$$ to find the magnitude. Since the plane flies due west (horizontal) and the magnetic field points straight up (vertical), the angle between them is 90°. The direction is found using RHR-1: thumb points west (velocity), fingers point up ($$\vb{B}$$), so the palm—and thus the force—points in a specific direction.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Charge: $$q = 0.500 \text{ μC} = 5.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C}$$
- Speed: $$v = 660 \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$
- Angle: $$\theta = 90°$$ (velocity horizontal, field vertical)

**(a) Magnitude and direction:**

$$F = qvB\sin\theta = qvB\sin(90°) = qvB$$

$$F = (5.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C})(660 \text{ m/s})(8.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T})$$

$$F = 2.64 \times 10^{-8} \text{ N}$$

For the direction, using RHR-1 with thumb pointing west and fingers pointing up: the palm pushes toward the **south**. (Alternatively: velocity west × field up = force south.)

**(b) Significance:**

This force of about 26 nN (nanonewtons) is incredibly small. To put it in perspective:
- A typical supersonic jet has a mass of about 20,000 kg
- Its weight is about $$2 \times 10^{5}$$ N
- The magnetic force is about $$10^{13}$$ times smaller than the weight

This force is completely negligible for any practical purpose. Even over the course of a long flight, the impulse from this force would produce an imperceptible change in momentum. The magnetic effect of Earth's field on charged aircraft is not something pilots or engineers need to consider.

**Discussion**

While Earth's magnetic field is crucial for navigation (compasses) and protects us from solar radiation, its direct magnetic force on slowly moving charged objects is negligible. The situation would be different for very fast-moving particles (like cosmic rays at near-light speeds) or particles in very strong artificial magnetic fields (like those in particle accelerators).

**(a) The magnetic force is $$2.64 \times 10^{-8}$$ N directed toward the south.**

**(b) This force is completely negligible—it is about $$10^{13}$$ times smaller than the aircraft's weight and has no practical effect on the plane's motion.**

$$B = \frac{1.70 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(5.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})(\sin 45°)}$$

$$B = \frac{1.70 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(5.00 \times 10^{7} \text{ m/s})(0.7071)}$$

$$B = \frac{1.70 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}{5.66 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C·m/s}}$$

$$B = 3.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$

**(b) Consistency with Earth's field:**

The calculated field strength of $$3.00 \times 10^{-5}$$ T is comparable to Earth's magnetic field at the surface, which ranges from about $$2.5 \times 10^{-5}$$ T at the equator to $$6.5 \times 10^{-5}$$ T near the poles, with a typical value of about $$5 \times 10^{-5}$$ T. Our calculated value is within this range, so it is consistent with this being Earth's magnetic field experienced by a cosmic ray.

**Discussion**

Cosmic ray protons travel at significant fractions of the speed of light (this one is moving at about 17% of light speed). The force they experience from Earth's magnetic field causes them to curve, which is why cosmic rays tend to follow Earth's field lines and enter the atmosphere preferentially near the magnetic poles. This gives rise to the aurora (Northern and Southern Lights) and is part of why Earth's magnetic field provides protection from cosmic radiation.

**(a) The magnetic field strength is $$3.01 \times 10^{-5}$$ T.**

**(b) This value is consistent with Earth's surface magnetic field (typically $$\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$$ T), confirming that the measured force could be due to Earth's magnetic field.**

An electron moving at  $$ 4.00 \times 10^{3}  \text{m/s} $$
 in a 1.25-T magnetic field experiences a magnetic force of  $$ 1.40 \times 10^{-16}  \text{N} $$ .
 What angle does the velocity of the electron make with the magnetic field? There are two answers.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the magnetic force equation $$F = qvB\sin\theta$$ and solve for $$\theta$$. Since $$\sin\theta$$ has the same value for angles $$\theta$$ and $$(180° - \theta)$$ in the range $$0°$$ to $$180°$$, there will indeed be two possible angles.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Electron speed: $$v = 4.00 \times 10^{3} \text{ m/s}$$
- Magnetic field: $$B = 1.25 \text{ T}$$
- Magnetic force: $$F = 1.40 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}$$
- Electron charge magnitude: $$|q| = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

From $$F = |q|vB\sin\theta$$, we solve for $$\sin\theta$$:

$$\sin\theta = \frac{F}{|q|vB}$$

$$\sin\theta = \frac{1.40 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(4.00 \times 10^{3} \text{ m/s})(1.25 \text{ T})}$$

$$\sin\theta = \frac{1.40 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}{8.00 \times 10^{-16} \text{ N}}$$

$$\sin\theta = 0.175$$

The two angles with this sine value are:

$$\theta_1 = \arcsin(0.175) = 10.1°$$

$$\theta_2 = 180° - 10.1° = 169.9° \approx 170°$$

**Discussion**

Both angles are physically meaningful. At $$\theta = 10.1°$$, the electron is moving nearly parallel to the magnetic field with a small perpendicular component. At $$\theta = 170°$$, the electron is moving nearly antiparallel to the field, again with a small perpendicular component. In both cases, only the perpendicular component of velocity contributes to the magnetic force, and since $$\sin(10.1°) = \sin(169.9°)$$, both produce the same force magnitude. This is why charged particles spiraling along magnetic field lines experience periodic force variations as their velocity direction changes.

**The angle between the electron's velocity and the magnetic field is either $$10.1°$$ or $$170°$$ (equivalently, $$169.9°$$).**

(a) A physicist performing a sensitive measurement wants to limit the magnetic force on a moving charge in her equipment to less than  $$ 1.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{N} $$ .
 What is the greatest the charge can be if it moves at a maximum speed of 30.0 m/s in the Earth’s field? (b) Discuss whether it would be difficult to limit the charge to less than the value found in (a) by comparing it with typical static electricity and noting that static is often absent.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the magnetic force equation $$F = qvB\sin\theta$$ to find the maximum allowable charge. The maximum force occurs when $$\sin\theta = 1$$ (velocity perpendicular to field), so we use $$F_{\text{max}} = qvB$$ and solve for $$q$$. We'll use Earth's typical surface field strength.

**Solution**

*Known quantities:*
- Maximum allowable force: $$F_{\text{max}} = 1.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ N}$$
- Maximum speed: $$v = 30.0 \text{ m/s}$$
- Earth's magnetic field: $$B = 5.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$ (typical value)

**(a) Maximum charge:**

From $$F = qvB$$, solving for $$q$$:

$$q = \frac{F}{vB}$$

$$q = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ N}}{(30.0 \text{ m/s})(5.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T})}$$

$$q = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ N}}{1.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ T·m/s}}$$

$$q = 6.67 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C}$$

**(b) Practicality discussion:**

This charge of about 0.67 nC (nanocoulombs) is actually quite small compared to typical static electricity charges:
- Rubbing a balloon on hair: ~10 nC to 100 nC
- Walking across a carpet: ~1 μC = 1000 nC
- A static shock: typically involves several μC

So the physicist would need to limit static charge to well below what typically accumulates through everyday activities. This would be challenging without specific measures such as:
- Using ionizers to neutralize static charge
- Working in a humidity-controlled environment (higher humidity reduces static)
- Using anti-static mats, straps, and coatings
- Grounding all equipment and personnel

The constraint could also be relaxed by reducing the speed of motion or by magnetically shielding the sensitive region.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates why precision physics experiments often require careful control of electromagnetic environments. The constraint of limiting magnetic force to piconewton levels is relevant in experiments like those measuring fundamental constants or testing small deviations from known physics. At this level, even tiny static charges—normally ignored—become significant sources of systematic error.

**(a) The maximum allowable charge is $$6.67 \times 10^{-10}$$ C or about 0.67 nC (assuming Earth's field is $$5.00 \times 10^{-5}$$ T).**

**(b) This is less than typical static electricity charges (which range from nC to μC), so it would be difficult to maintain charges below this limit without specific anti-static measures.**
