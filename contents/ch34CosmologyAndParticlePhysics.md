* Discuss the expansion of the universe.

</div>

Look at the sky on some clear night when you are away from city lights. There
you will see thousands of individual stars and a faint glowing background of
millions more. The Milky Way, as it has been called since ancient times, is an
arm of our galaxy of stars—the word _galaxy_ coming from the Greek word _
galaxias_, meaning milky. We know a great deal about our Milky Way galaxy and of
the billions of other galaxies beyond its fringes. But they still provoke wonder
and awe (see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). And there are still many questions to be
answered. Most remarkable when we view the universe on the large scale is that
once again explanations of its character and evolution are tied to the very
small scale. Particle physics and the questions being asked about the very small
scales may also have their answers in the very large scales.

Some spots show evidence of an interior spiral structure whereas others are more uniform.](../resources/Figure_34_01_01.jpg 'Take a moment to contemplate these clusters of galaxies, photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.

As has been noted in numerous Things Great and Small vignettes, this is not the
first time the large has been explained by the small and vice versa. Newton
realized that the nature of gravity on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground
could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Minute
atoms and molecules explain the chemistry of substances on a much larger scale.
Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei
likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in particle physics
seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the
nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle
physics.

**Cosmology** is the study of the character and evolution of the universe. What
are the major characteristics of the universe as we know them today? First,
there are approximately $$ 10^{11} $$ galaxies in the observable part of the
universe. An average galaxy contains more than $$ 10^{11} $$ stars, with our
Milky Way galaxy being larger than average, both in its number of stars and its
dimensions. Ours is a spiral-shaped galaxy with a diameter of about 100 000
light years and a thickness of about 2000 light years in the arms with a central
bulge about 10 000 light years across. The Sun lies about 30 000 light years
from the center near the galactic plane. There are significant clouds of gas,
and there is a halo of less-dense regions of stars surrounding the main body. (
See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) Evidence strongly suggests the existence of a
large amount of additional matter in galaxies that does not produce light—the
mysterious dark matter we shall later discuss.

![The figure contains three images of the Milky Way galaxy. The first is a side view from outer space and shows a long thin grouping of bright stars against a black background. In the middle of this thin line of stars is a bright yellow ball that looks a bit like an egg yolk in the middle of the egg white. The length of the thin line is given as one hundred thousand light years and it thickness is given as two thousand light years. The diameter of the egg-yolk-like cluster in the middle is given as ten thousand light years. Thirty thousand light years to the left of the center of the egg yolk is the Sun. The second image is a view from above of the Milky Way galaxy and shows several spiral arms twisting outward from the center egg-yolk form. The last image is a photograph from Earth of the Milky Way galaxy in the nighttime sky. It shows a dusting of stars in the sky, with a slight concentration of star dust forming a horizontal stripe across the image.](../resources/Figure_34_01_02.jpg 'The Milky Way galaxy is typical of large spiral galaxies in its size, its shape, and the presence of gas and dust.

{: #Figure2}

Distances are great even within our galaxy and are measured in light years (the
distance traveled by light in one year). The average distance between galaxies
is on the order of a million light years, but it varies greatly with galaxies
forming clusters such as shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The Magellanic Clouds,
for example, are small galaxies close to our own, some 160 000 light years from
Earth. The Andromeda galaxy is a large spiral galaxy like ours and lies 2
million light years away. It is just visible to the naked eye as an extended
glow in the Andromeda constellation. Andromeda is the closest large galaxy in
our local group, and we can see some individual stars in it with our larger
telescopes. The most distant known galaxy is 14 billion light years from Earth—a
truly incredible distance. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![The first image shows a shining spiral cloud of light and dust. The second image contains three sub images. The first is a large scale view of numerous points of lights and light clouds against a black background. A small square appears in the upper left of the image, and the second image is the zoom-in of this square. In the center of this second image appears a small red dot, which is again boxed in by a square. The third image shows a zoomed-in view of the square from the second image and shows a hazy picture of a circular bright spot surrounded by darker regions.](../resources/Figure_34_01_03.jpg '(a) Andromeda is the closest large galaxy, at 2 million light years distance, and is very similar to our Milky Way. The blue regions harbor young and emerging stars, while dark streaks are vast clouds of gas and dust. A smaller satellite galaxy is clearly visible.

Illingworth (University of California, Santa Cruz), R. Bouwens (University of California, Santa Cruz and Leiden University), and the HUDF09 Team) ')
{: #Figure3}

Consider the fact that the light we receive from these vast distances has been
on its way to us for a long time. In fact, the time in years is the same as the
distance in light years. For example, the Andromeda galaxy is 2 million light
years away, so that the light now reaching us left it 2 million years ago. If we
could be there now, Andromeda would be different. Similarly, light from the most
distant galaxy left it 14 billion years ago. We have an incredible view of the
past when looking great distances. We can try to see if the universe was
different then—if distant galaxies are more tightly packed or have
younger-looking stars, for example, than closer galaxies, in which case there
has been an evolution in time. But the problem is that the uncertainties in our
data are great. Cosmology is almost typified by these large uncertainties, so
that we must be especially cautious in drawing conclusions. One consequence is
that there are more questions than answers, and so there are many competing
theories. Another consequence is that any hard data produce a major result.
Discoveries of some importance are being made on a regular basis, the hallmark
of a field in its golden age.

Perhaps the most important characteristic of the universe is that all galaxies
except those in our local cluster seem to be moving away from us at speeds
proportional to their distance from our galaxy. It looks as if a gigantic
explosion, universally called the **Big Bang**, threw matter out some billions
of years ago. This amazing conclusion is based on the pioneering work of Edwin
Hubble (1889–1953), the American astronomer. In the 1920s, Hubble first
demonstrated conclusively that other galaxies, many previously called nebulae or
clouds of stars, were outside our own. He then found that all but the closest
galaxies have a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that is proportional to
their distance. The explanation is that there is a **cosmological red shift**
due to the expansion of space itself. The photon wavelength is stretched in
transit from the source to the observer. Double the distance, and the red shift
is doubled. While this cosmological red shift is often called a Doppler shift,
it is not—space itself is expanding. There is no center of expansion in the
universe. All observers see themselves as stationary; the other objects in space
appear to be moving away from them. Hubble was directly responsible for
discovering that the universe was much larger than had previously been imagined
and that it had this amazing characteristic of rapid expansion.

Universal expansion on the scale of galactic clusters (that is, galaxies at
smaller distances are not uniformly receding from one another) is an integral
part of modern cosmology. For galaxies farther away than about 50 Mly (50
million light years), the expansion is uniform with variations due to local
motions of galaxies within clusters. A representative recession velocity $$v $$
can be obtained from the simple formula

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{v}={H}_{0}d\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$d $$ is the distance to the galaxy and $${H}_{0} $$ is the **Hubble
constant**. The Hubble constant is a central concept in cosmology. Its value is
determined by taking the slope of a graph of velocity versus distance, obtained
from red shift measurements, such as shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). We shall
use an approximate value of $${H}_{0}=20\text{km/s}\cdot \text{Mly}. $$ Thus,
$$v={H}\_{0}d $$ is an average behavior for all but the closest galaxies. For
example, a galaxy 100 Mly away (as determined by its size and brightness)
typically moves away from us at a speed of $$v=\left(20\text{km/s}\cdot \text{Mly}\right)\left(100\text{Mly}\right)=2000\text{km/s}. $$ There can be
variations in this speed due to so-called local motions or interactions with
neighboring galaxies. Conversely, if a galaxy is found to be moving away from us
at speed of 100 000 km/s based on its red shift, it is at a distance

$$ d=v/{H}_{0}=\left(10 000\text{km/s}\right)/\left(20\text{km/s}\cdot \text{Mly}\right)=5000\text{Mly}=5\text{Gly} $$ or $$5 \times 10^{9} \text{ly} $$ . This last calculation is approximate, because it assumes the expansion rate 
was the same 5 billion years ago as now. A similar calculation in Hubble’s
measurement changed the notion that the universe is in a steady state.

![A graph of red shift versus distance that contains a lot of points through which fits a straight line passing through the origin.](../resources/Figure_34_01_04.jpg "This graph of red shift versus distance for galaxies shows a linear relationship, with larger red shifts at greater distances, implying an expanding universe. The slope gives an approximate value for the expansion rate. (credit: John Cub).")
{: #Figure4}

One of the most intriguing developments recently has been the discovery that the
expansion of the universe may be *faster now* than in the past, rather than
slowing due to gravity as expected. Various groups have been looking, in
particular, at supernovas in moderately distant galaxies (less than 1 Gly) to
get improved distance measurements. Those distances are larger than expected for
the observed galactic red shifts, implying the expansion was slower when that
light was emitted. This has cosmological consequences that are discussed
in [Dark Matter and Closure](../contents/ch34DarkMatterAndClosure). The first results, published in 1999, are
only the beginning of emerging data, with astronomy now entering a data-rich
era.

[[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows how the recession of galaxies looks like the
remnants of a gigantic explosion, the famous Big Bang. Extrapolating backward in
time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago when
all matter would have been at a point. Questions instantly arise. What caused
the explosion? What happened before the Big Bang? Was there a before, or did
time start then? Will the universe expand forever, or will gravity reverse it
into a Big Crunch? And is there other evidence of the Big Bang besides the
well-documented red shifts?

![The figure shows an artist&#x2019;s rendition of galaxies of different shapes moving away from the center, where a spiral galaxy labeled M W is located.](../resources/Figure_34_01_05.jpg "Galaxies are flying apart from one another, with the more distant moving faster as if a primordial explosion expelled the matter from which they formed. The most distant known galaxies move nearly at the speed of light relative to us. ")
{: #Figure5}

The Russian-born American physicist George Gamow (1904–1968) was among the first
to note that, if there was a Big Bang, the remnants of the primordial fireball
should still be evident and should be blackbody radiation. Since the radiation
from this fireball has been traveling to us since shortly after the Big Bang,
its wavelengths should be greatly stretched. It will look as if the fireball has
cooled in the billions of years since the Big Bang. Gamow and collaborators
predicted in the late 1940s that there should be blackbody radiation from the
explosion filling space with a characteristic temperature of about 7 K. Such
blackbody radiation would have its peak intensity in the microwave part of the
spectrum. (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).) In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert
Wilson, two American scientists working with Bell Telephone Laboratories on a
low-noise radio antenna, detected the radiation and eventually recognized it for
what it is.

[[Figure 6]](#Figure6)(b) shows the spectrum of this microwave radiation
that permeates space and is of cosmic origin. It is the most perfect blackbody
spectrum known, and the temperature of the fireball remnant is determined from
it to be $$ 2.725± 0.002\text{K} $$ . The detection of what is now called the **cosmic microwave background** (CMBR) was so important (generally considered as
important as Hubble’s detection that the galactic red shift is proportional to
distance) that virtually every scientist has accepted the expansion of the
universe as fact. Penzias and Wilson shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for
their discovery.

![Figure a shows an artist&#x2019;s rendition of the Big Bang explosion. Here, the explosion is depicted as a flash of light then a nonuniform purple-colored sphere containing galaxies. With each galaxy is associated an arrow pointing radially outward. The length of the arrows varies from one galaxy to the next. Figure b shows a graph of intensity versus wavelength. The intensity is on an arbitrary scale and the wavelength ranges from zero point five to 10 millimeters. The intensity begins at zero point two then rises sharply to one point two at a wavelength of one millimeter. It then descends to near zero by ten millimeters.](../resources/Figure_34_01_06.jpg "(a) The Big Bang is used to explain the present observed expansion of the universe.

It is characteristic of a temperature of 2.725 K, the expansion-cooled temperature of the Big Bang&#x2019;s remnant.

It is compelling evidence of the creation of the universe in a gigantic explosion, already indicated by galactic red shifts. ")

Making Connections: Cosmology and Particle Physics
</div>
There are many connections of cosmology—by definition involving physics on the largest scale—with particle physics—by definition physics on the smallest scale. Among these are the dominance of matter over antimatter, the nearly perfect uniformity of the cosmic microwave background, and the mere existence of galaxies.

</div>

<span class="title">**Matter versus antimatter**</span>We know from direct
observation that antimatter is rare. The Earth and the solar system are nearly
pure matter. Space probes and cosmic rays give direct evidence—the landing of
the Viking probes on Mars would have been spectacular explosions of mutual
annihilation energy if Mars were antimatter. We also know that most of the
universe is dominated by matter. This is proven by the lack of annihilation
radiation coming to us from space, particularly the relative absence of
0.511-MeV $$\gamma $$ rays created by the mutual annihilation of electrons and
positrons. It seemed possible that there could be entire solar systems or
galaxies made of antimatter in perfect symmetry with our matter-dominated
systems. But the interactions between stars and galaxies would sometimes bring
matter and antimatter together in large amounts. The annihilation radiation they
would produce is simply not observed. Antimatter in nature is created in
particle collisions and in $${\beta }^{+} $$ decays, but only in small amounts
that quickly annihilate, leaving almost pure matter surviving.

Particle physics seems symmetric in matter and antimatter. Why isn’t the cosmos?
The answer is that particle physics is not quite perfectly symmetric in this
regard. The decay of one of the neutral $$K $$ -mesons, for example,
preferentially creates more matter than antimatter. This is caused by a
fundamental small asymmetry in the basic forces. This small asymmetry produced
slightly more matter than antimatter in the early universe. If there was only
one part in $$10^{9} $$ more matter (a small asymmetry), the rest would
annihilate pair for pair, leaving nearly pure matter to form the stars and
galaxies we see today. So the vast number of stars we observe may be only a tiny
remnant of the original matter created in the Big Bang. Here at last we see a
very real and important asymmetry in nature. Rather than be disturbed by an
asymmetry, most physicists are impressed by how small it is. Furthermore, if the
universe were completely symmetric, the mutual annihilation would be more
complete, leaving far less matter to form us and the universe we know.

<span class="title">**How can something so old have so few wrinkles?**</span>A
troubling aspect of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was soon
recognized. True, the CMBR verified the Big Bang, had the correct temperature,
and had a blackbody spectrum as expected. But the CMBR was *too* smooth—it
looked identical in every direction. Galaxies and other similar entities could
not be formed without the existence of fluctuations in the primordial stages of
the universe and so there should be hot and cool spots in the CMBR, nicknamed
wrinkles, corresponding to dense and sparse regions of gas caused by turbulence
or early fluctuations. Over time, dense regions would contract under gravity and
form stars and galaxies. Why aren’t the fluctuations there? (This is a good
example of an answer producing more questions.) Furthermore, galaxies are
observed very far from us, so that they formed very long ago. The problem was to
explain how galaxies could form so early and so quickly after the Big Bang if
its remnant fingerprint is perfectly smooth. The answer is that if you look very
closely, the CMBR is not perfectly smooth, only extremely smooth.

A satellite called the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) carried an instrument
that made very sensitive and accurate measurements of the CMBR. In April of
1992, there was extraordinary publicity of COBE’s first results—there were small
fluctuations in the CMBR. Further measurements were carried out by experiments
including NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which launched in
2001. Data from WMAP provided a much more detailed picture of the CMBR  fluctuations. (See [[Figure 7]](#Figure7).) These amount to
temperature fluctuations of only $$200 \mu \text{k} $$ out of 2.7 K,
better than one part in 1000.

Planck Surveyor, which launched in 2009.

Let us now examine the various stages of the overall evolution of the universe
from the Big Bang to the present, illustrated in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8). Note
that scientific notation is used to encompass the many orders of magnitude in
time, energy, temperature, and size of the universe. Going back in time, the two
lines approach but do not cross (there is no zero on an exponential scale).
Rather, they extend indefinitely in ever-smaller time intervals to some
infinitesimal point.

![The figure shows a horizontal bar whose left end is white and right end is black. Between these ends the bar is rainbow colored with blue at the left and red at the right. On the top of the bar is a time scale that starts at the left at ten to the minus forty three seconds and goes to one point five times ten  to the eleven years, which is the present time. On the bottom of the bar is an energy scale that starts at the left at ten to the nineteenth G E V and goes to below one G E V. The left end of the bar is labeled T O E and complete symmetry, identical particles. Progressing to the right, the next section of the bar, from ten to the minus forty three seconds to ten to the minus thirty five seconds, is labeled G U T and leptons, gluons, quarks, weak bosons, photons. The next section of the bar, out to ten to the minus thirty two seconds (or ten to the fourteenth G E V) is labeled spontaneous symmetry breaking, inflation. During this stage, the bar widens significantly. The next section goes to ten to the minus eleven seconds (or one hundred G E V) and is labeled electroweak and leptons, quarks, w plus minus, z zero, photons. The point ten to the minus eleven seconds is labeled leptons, hadrons, photons. The next section goes to three times ten to the fifth years. The point about midway through this stage is labeled one G E V. In this stage are labeled the following eras: at about ten to the minus six seconds is the quark era, at about ten to the minus four seconds is the lepton era, at about ten seconds is the photon era, then at about ten seconds is the nucleosynthesis era. The point three times ten to the fifth years is labeled light nuclei. The next section goes to ten to the eighth years and is labeled atoms. The  point ten to the eighth years is labeled stars and protogalaxies. Next comes galaxies at ten to the ninth years, then Earth comes at ten to the eleventh years, life at one point zero five times ten to the eleventh years, then finally the present time at one point five times ten to the eleventh years.](../resources/Figure_34_01_08.jpg "The evolution of the universe from the Big Bang onward is intimately tied to the laws of physics, especially those of particle physics at the earliest stages. The universe is relativistic throughout its history. Theories of the unification of forces at high energies may be verified by their shaping of the universe and its evolution. ")
{: #Figure8}

Going back in time is equivalent to what would happen if expansion stopped and
gravity pulled all the galaxies together, compressing and heating all matter. At
a time long ago, the temperature and density were too high for stars and
galaxies to exist. Before then, there was a time when the temperature was too
great for atoms to exist. And farther back yet, there was a time when the
temperature and density were so great that nuclei could not exist. Even farther
back in time, the temperature was so high that average kinetic energy was great
enough to create short-lived particles, and the density was high enough to make
this likely. When we extrapolate back to the point of $${W}^{±} $$ and $${Z}^{0} $$ production (thermal energies reaching 1 TeV, or a temperature of about $$ 10^{15} \text{K} $$ ), we reach the limits of what we know directly about particle physics. This is at a time about $$ 10^{-12} \text{s} $$ after the Big
Bang. While $$ 10^{-12} \text{s} $$ may seem to be negligibly close to the
instant of creation, it is not. There are important stages before this time that
are tied to the unification of forces. At those stages, the universe was at
extremely high energies and average particle separations were smaller than we
can achieve with accelerators. What happened in the early stages before

10^{-12} \text{s} $$ is crucial to all later stages and is possibly discerned by $$
observing present conditions in the universe. One of these is the smoothness of
the CMBR.

Names are given to early stages representing key conditions. The stage before $$ 10^{-11} \text{s} $$ back to $$ 10^{-34} \text{s} $$ is called the **electroweak
epoch**, because the electromagnetic and weak forces become identical for
energies above about 100 GeV. As discussed earlier, theorists expect that the
strong force becomes identical to and thus unified with the electroweak force at
energies of about $$ 10^{14} \text{GeV} $$ . The average particle energy would
be this great at $$ 10^{-34} \text{s} $$ after the Big Bang, if there are no
surprises in the unknown physics at energies above about 1 TeV. At the immense
energy of $$ 10^{14} \text{GeV} $$
(corresponding to a temperature of about $$ 10^{26} \text{K} $$ ), the $${W}^{±} $$ and $${Z}^{0} $$ carrier particles would be transformed into massless gauge
bosons to accomplish the unification. Before $$ 10^{-34} \text{s} $$ back to
about $$ 10^{-43} \text{s} $$ , we have Grand Unification in the **GUT epoch**,
in which all forces except gravity are identical. At $$ 10^{-43} \text{s} $$ ,
the average energy reaches the immense $$ 10^{19} \text{GeV} $$ needed to unify
gravity with the other forces in TOE, the Theory of Everything. Before that time
is the **TOE epoch**, but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the
universe then, since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity. We call the
hypothetical unified force **superforce**.

Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type
of universe is created from various events along the way. As temperatures and
average energies decrease with expansion, the universe reaches the stage where
average particle separations are large enough to see differences between the
strong and electroweak forces (at about $$ 10^{-35} \text{s} $$ ). After this
time, the forces become distinct in almost all interactions—they are no longer
unified or symmetric. This transition from GUT to electroweak is an example
of **spontaneous symmetry breaking**, in which conditions spontaneously evolved
to a point where the forces were no longer unified, breaking that symmetry. This
is analogous to a phase transition in the universe, and a clever proposal by
American physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980s ties it to the smoothness of the
CMBR. Guth proposed that spontaneous symmetry breaking (like a phase transition
during cooling of normal matter) released an immense amount of energy that
caused the universe to expand extremely rapidly for the brief time from $$ 10^{-35} \text{s} $$ to about $$ 10^{-32} \text{s} $$ . This expansion may have
been by an incredible factor of $$ 10^{50} $$ or more in the size of the
universe and is thus called the **inflationary scenario**. One result of this
inflation is that it would stretch the wrinkles in the universe nearly flat,
leaving an extremely smooth CMBR. While speculative, there is as yet no other
plausible explanation for the smoothness of the CMBR. Unless the CMBR is not
really cosmic but local in origin, the distances between regions of similar
temperatures are too great for any coordination to have caused them, since any
coordination mechanism must travel at the speed of light. Again, particle
physics and cosmology are intimately entwined. There is little hope that we may
be able to test the inflationary scenario directly, since it occurs at energies
near $$ 10^{14} \text{GeV} $$ , vastly greater than the limits of modern
accelerators. But the idea is so attractive that it is incorporated into most
cosmological theories.

Characteristics of the present universe may help us determine the validity of
this intriguing idea. Additionally, the recent indications that the universe’s
expansion rate may be _increasing_ (see [Dark Matter and Closure](../contents/ch34DarkMatterAndClosure))
could even imply that we are _in_ another inflationary epoch.

It is important to note that, if conditions such as those found in the early
universe could be created in the laboratory, we would see the unification of
forces directly today. The forces have not changed in time, but the average
energy and separation of particles in the universe have. As discussed
in [The Four Basic Forces](../contents/ch33TheFourBasicForces), the four basic forces in nature are
distinct under most circumstances found today. The early universe and its
remnants provide evidence from times when they were unified under most
circumstances.

### Section Summary

- Cosmology is the study of the character and evolution of the universe.
- The two most important features of the universe are the cosmological red
  shifts of its galaxies being proportional to distance and its cosmic microwave
  background (CMBR). Both support the notion that there was a gigantic
  explosion, known as the Big Bang that created the universe.
- Galaxies farther away than our local group have, on an average, a recessional
  velocity given by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$v={H}_{0}d\text{,} $$
  </div>
     where  $$d $$
     is the distance to the galaxy and  $${H}_{0} $$
     is the Hubble constant, taken to have the average value  $${H}_{0}=20 \text{km/s}\cdot \text{Mly}\text{.} $$

- Explanations of the large-scale characteristics of the universe are intimately
  tied to particle physics.
- The dominance of matter over antimatter and the smoothness of the CMBR are two
  characteristics that are tied to particle physics.
- The epochs of the universe are known back to very shortly after the Big Bang,
  based on known laws of physics.
- The earliest epochs are tied to the unification of forces, with the
  electroweak epoch being partially understood, the GUT epoch being speculative,
  and the TOE epoch being highly speculative since it involves an unknown single
  superforce.
- The transition from GUT to electroweak is called spontaneous symmetry
  breaking. It released energy that caused the inflationary scenario, which in
  turn explains the smoothness of the CMBR.

Find the approximate mass of the dark and luminous matter in the Milky Way galaxy. Assume the luminous matter is due to approximately  $$ 10^{11} $$
 stars of average mass 1.5 times that of our Sun, and take the dark matter to be 10 times as massive as the luminous matter.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the total mass of both luminous and dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy. From the previous problem, we know the mass of luminous matter is $$ 3 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} $$. The problem states that dark matter is 10 times as massive as the luminous matter, so we can calculate the dark matter mass and then add both components to get the total mass.

**Solution**

From the previous problem, the mass of luminous matter in the Milky Way is:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{luminous}} = 3 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

The mass of dark matter is 10 times the luminous matter:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{dark}} = 10 \times m_{\text{luminous}} = 10 \times 3 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} = 3 \times 10^{42} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

The total mass is the sum of luminous and dark matter:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{luminous}} + m_{\text{dark}} = 3 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} + 3 \times 10^{42} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} + 30 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} = 33 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} = 3.3 \times 10^{42} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The total mass of the Milky Way galaxy, including both dark and luminous matter, is approximately **3.3 × 10⁴² kg**. This result reveals a profound truth about our galaxy: the vast majority (about 91%) of its mass is in the form of dark matter, which does not emit light and can only be detected through its gravitational effects. The luminous matter—all the stars, gas, and dust we can observe—represents only about 9% of the total mass. This is consistent with observations of galactic rotation curves, which show that stars far from the galactic center orbit faster than would be expected based on the visible matter alone. The presence of this massive dark matter halo is necessary to explain the observed dynamics of our galaxy and prevent the outer stars from flying off into intergalactic space. This dark matter problem is one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in modern physics, and understanding its nature is crucial for our comprehension of galaxy formation, structure, and evolution throughout the universe.

If a galaxy is 500 Mly away from us, how fast do we expect it to be moving and in what direction?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We can use Hubble's law to determine the recession velocity of a galaxy at a given distance. Hubble's law states that $$ v = H_0 d $$, where $$ v $$ is the recession velocity, $$ H_0 $$ is the Hubble constant, and $$ d $$ is the distance to the galaxy. From the chapter, we know that $$ H_0 = 20 \text{ km/s} \cdot \text{Mly} $$. The direction of motion for distant galaxies is always away from us due to the expansion of the universe.

**Solution**

Using Hubble's law:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = H_0 d $$
</div>

Substituting the given values:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = \left(20 \text{ km/s} \cdot \text{Mly}\right) \times 500 \text{ Mly} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = 10{,}000 \text{ km/s} = 1.0 \times 10^4 \text{ km/s} $$
</div>

The galaxy is moving **away from us** at a speed of approximately **10,000 km/s** (or **1.0 × 10⁴ km/s**).

**Discussion**

This velocity of 10,000 km/s is quite substantial—about 3.3% of the speed of light. The fact that the galaxy is moving away from us is not because we are at the center of the universe, but rather because space itself is expanding uniformly in all directions. Every observer in the universe would see distant galaxies receding from them, with velocities proportional to distance. This is a fundamental characteristic of the expanding universe first discovered by Edwin Hubble. The recession velocity we calculated represents the rate at which the space between us and the galaxy is expanding. It's important to note that this is not motion through space in the conventional sense, but rather the expansion of space itself. For a galaxy at 500 Mly, this velocity is well within the regime where Hubble's law gives accurate predictions. For much more distant galaxies (several billion light years away), relativistic corrections become necessary, and the simple linear relationship between distance and velocity begins to break down.

Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Assuming a circular orbit 30 000 ly in radius and an orbital speed of 250 km/s, how many years does it take for one revolution? Note that this is approximate, assuming constant speed and circular orbit, but it is representative of the time for our system and local stars to make one revolution around the galaxy.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the orbital period, we need to calculate the circumference of the circular orbit and divide by the orbital speed. The orbital radius is given in light years (ly), so we'll need to work with consistent units. We can either convert the speed to ly/year or convert the circumference to kilometers. The former approach is more elegant for this problem since it allows us to directly calculate the period in years.

**Solution**

First, let's find the orbital circumference:
<div class="equation">
$$ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi \times 30{,}000 \text{ ly} = 188{,}496 \text{ ly} $$
</div>

Next, we need to convert the orbital speed from km/s to ly/year.

The speed of light is $$ c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} $$, and one light year is the distance light travels in one year. Therefore:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{v}{c} = \frac{250 \text{ km/s}}{3.00 \times 10^5 \text{ km/s}} = 8.33 \times 10^{-4} $$
</div>

This means the orbital speed is $$ 8.33 \times 10^{-4} $$ light years per year.

The orbital period is:
<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{C}{v} = \frac{188{,}496 \text{ ly}}{8.33 \times 10^{-4} \text{ ly/year}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = 2.26 \times 10^8 \text{ years} = 226 \text{ million years} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Our solar system takes approximately **226 million years** to complete one orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. This immense period is often called a "galactic year" or "cosmic year." Since the Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago, it has completed roughly 20 orbits around the galactic center during its lifetime. This long orbital period reflects the enormous size of our galaxy and the relatively modest orbital speed of the Sun. During one complete orbit, the solar system travels a distance of nearly 190,000 light years—a truly astronomical journey! This orbital motion has important implications for Earth's long-term evolution: as we move through different regions of the galaxy, we may encounter varying densities of interstellar material, different radiation environments, and even spiral arm crossings that could affect the rate of star formation and supernova frequency in our cosmic neighborhood. The last time the Sun was in its current position in the galaxy, dinosaurs had not yet evolved on Earth, illustrating the vast timescales involved in galactic dynamics.

(a) Calculate the approximate age of the universe from the average value of the Hubble constant,  $${H}_{0}=20\text{km/s}\cdot \text{Mly} $$ .
 To do this, calculate the time it would take to travel 1 Mly at a constant expansion rate of 20 km/s. (b) If deceleration is taken into account, would the actual age of the universe be greater or less than that found here? Explain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The age of the universe can be estimated by calculating the Hubble time, which is the time it would take for two galaxies separated by 1 Mly to reach that separation if they have been moving apart at a constant rate of 20 km/s. This requires converting 1 Mly to kilometers and then calculating the time as distance divided by speed.

(b) We need to consider how the expansion rate has changed over time. If the universe has been decelerating (slowing down), this means it was expanding faster in the past, which would affect our age estimate.

**Solution**

(a) The time to travel 1 Mly at 20 km/s is:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{1 \text{ Mly}}{20 \text{ km/s}} $$
</div>

First, convert 1 Mly to kilometers:
<div class="equation">
$$ 1 \text{ Mly} = 10^6 \text{ ly} \times 9.46 \times 10^{12} \text{ km/ly} = 9.46 \times 10^{18} \text{ km} $$
</div>

Now calculate the time:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{9.46 \times 10^{18} \text{ km}}{20 \text{ km/s}} = 4.73 \times 10^{17} \text{ s} $$
</div>

Converting to years (using $$ 1 \text{ year} = 3.156 \times 10^7 \text{ s} $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{4.73 \times 10^{17} \text{ s}}{3.156 \times 10^7 \text{ s/year}} = 1.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ years} = 15 \text{ billion years} $$
</div>

(b) If deceleration is taken into account, the actual age of the universe would be **less** than the value calculated above.

**Discussion**

(a) Our calculation gives an approximate age of the universe of **15 billion years** (or 1.5 × 10¹⁰ years). This is reasonably close to the currently accepted age of approximately 13.8 billion years, demonstrating that the Hubble constant provides a useful way to estimate the universe's age. This calculation assumes the expansion rate has been constant throughout the universe's history, which is why we call it the "Hubble time."

(b) The reasoning for part (b) is crucial: If the universe has been decelerating (as was long believed due to gravitational attraction between galaxies), this means the expansion was faster in the past. If galaxies were moving apart faster in the earlier universe, they would have reached their current separations in less time than our constant-rate calculation suggests. Think of it this way: if you're currently traveling at 20 km/s but you used to be traveling at 30 km/s and have been slowing down, you would have covered the same distance in less time than if you had been traveling at a constant 20 km/s the entire time. Therefore, accounting for deceleration would give a younger universe than our Hubble time estimate. Interestingly, recent observations suggest the universe's expansion may actually be accelerating (not decelerating), which is attributed to dark energy. If acceleration is occurring, the actual age would be greater than our estimate, since the universe was expanding more slowly in the past. This shows how the dynamics of cosmic expansion directly affect our understanding of the universe's age and evolution.

(a) What is the approximate force of gravity on a 70-kg person due to the Andromeda galaxy, assuming its total mass is  $$ 10^{13} $$
 that of our Sun and acts like a single mass 2 Mly away? (b) What is the ratio of this force to the person's weight? Note that Andromeda is the closest large galaxy.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We can use Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the gravitational force between the person and the Andromeda galaxy. We'll need to convert the galaxy's mass (given in solar masses) to kilograms and the distance (given in Mly) to meters.

(b) To find the ratio, we'll divide the gravitational force from Andromeda by the person's weight on Earth (which is the gravitational force due to Earth).

**Solution**

(a) Newton's law of universal gravitation is:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$
</div>

where $$ G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N·m}^2\text{/kg}^2 $$, $$ M $$ is the mass of Andromeda, $$ m = 70 \text{ kg} $$ is the person's mass, and $$ r $$ is the distance.

The mass of Andromeda:
<div class="equation">
$$ M = 10^{13} \times M_{\text{Sun}} = 10^{13} \times 2.0 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} = 2.0 \times 10^{43} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

The distance in meters:
<div class="equation">
$$ r = 2 \text{ Mly} = 2 \times 10^6 \text{ ly} \times 9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m/ly} = 1.892 \times 10^{22} \text{ m} $$
</div>

Substituting into Newton's law:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(2.0 \times 10^{43})(70)}{(1.892 \times 10^{22})^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{9.34 \times 10^{34}}{3.58 \times 10^{44}} = 2.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ N} $$
</div>

(b) The person's weight on Earth is:
<div class="equation">
$$ W = mg = 70 \text{ kg} \times 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 = 686 \text{ N} $$
</div>

The ratio is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F}{W} = \frac{2.6 \times 10^{-10} \text{ N}}{686 \text{ N}} = 3.8 \times 10^{-13} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The gravitational force exerted by the entire Andromeda galaxy on a person is extraordinarily small: only **2.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ N**. To put this in perspective, this is about the weight of a single bacterium! The ratio of this force to the person's weight is **3.8 × 10⁻¹³**, meaning Andromeda's gravitational pull is less than a trillionth of Earth's pull on the same person. This demonstrates a fundamental principle: while gravity has infinite range and never goes to zero, it becomes vanishingly weak over astronomical distances due to the inverse square law. Even though Andromeda contains hundreds of billions of stars and has a total mass 10 trillion times that of our Sun, its enormous distance (2 million light years) makes its gravitational effect on us utterly negligible. This is why we don't feel the gravitational pull of distant galaxies in our daily lives, and why the universe's expansion can overcome gravity on the largest scales. The calculation also shows that local gravitational effects (from Earth, the Sun, and even our own galaxy) completely dominate over the pull from external galaxies. This is reassuring—if Andromeda's gravity were significant, we'd be in serious trouble, as it's on a collision course with the Milky Way (though that collision won't happen for about 4 billion years)!

(a) A particle and its antiparticle are at rest relative to an observer and annihilate (completely destroying both masses), creating two  $$\gamma  $$

-ray energy you would look for if searching for evidence of proton-antiproton annihilation? (The fact that such radiation is rarely observed is evidence that there is very little antimatter in the universe.) (b) How does this compare with the 0.511-MeV energy associated with electron-positron annihilation?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) When a particle and antiparticle at rest annihilate, conservation of energy and momentum requires that two photons of equal energy be produced (moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum). The total energy available is the sum of the rest mass energies of both particles. For a proton-antiproton pair, each has a rest mass energy of approximately 938 MeV, so the total is divided equally between the two photons.

(b) We'll compare the proton-antiproton annihilation energy per photon with the electron-positron annihilation energy per photon (0.511 MeV).

**Solution**

(a) The rest mass energy of a proton is:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_p = m_p c^2 = 938.3 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

When a proton and antiproton annihilate at rest, the total energy is:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{total}} = 2m_p c^2 = 2 \times 938.3 \text{ MeV} = 1877 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

This energy is shared equally between two photons, so each photon has energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_\gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{1877 \text{ MeV}}{2} = 938 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

(b) The ratio of the proton-antiproton annihilation photon energy to the electron-positron annihilation photon energy is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{E_{\gamma}(\text{p-}\bar{\text{p}})}{E_{\gamma}(\text{e}^+-\text{e}^-)} = \frac{938 \text{ MeV}}{0.511 \text{ MeV}} = 1836 $$
</div>

The proton-antiproton annihilation produces photons with **1836 times** more energy than electron-positron annihilation.

**Discussion**

We would look for **938-MeV gamma rays** as evidence of proton-antiproton annihilation. This is a very specific signature—gamma rays of this energy would be a clear indicator of matter-antimatter annihilation involving baryons. The fact that we don't observe significant amounts of 938-MeV gamma radiation from space provides strong evidence that the universe is dominated by matter, not antimatter. If there were substantial amounts of antimatter in the form of anti-galaxies or anti-stars, we would expect to see annihilation radiation at the boundaries where matter and antimatter regions meet.

The comparison with electron-positron annihilation is revealing: the energy ratio of 1836 is exactly the mass ratio of the proton to the electron. This makes perfect sense from Einstein's mass-energy relation $$ E = mc^2 $$—the annihilation energy is directly proportional to the particle mass. The 0.511-MeV photons from electron-positron annihilation are relatively common in certain astrophysical environments and can be detected by gamma-ray telescopes. The 938-MeV photons from proton-antiproton annihilation would be even more energetic and equally detectable if they existed in significant quantities. The rarity of such observations confirms that the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe is profound: essentially all of the universe we can observe is made of ordinary matter, with antimatter being produced only briefly in high-energy collisions or certain radioactive decays before quickly annihilating with the abundant matter around it.

where $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$, $$ c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} $$, and $$ \lambda = 1.1 \text{ mm} = 1.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} $$.

<div class="equation">
$$ E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.1 \times 10^{-3}} = 1.81 \times 10^{-22} \text{ J} $$
</div>

Converting to eV (using $$ 1 \text{ eV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ E = \frac{1.81 \times 10^{-22} \text{ J}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} = 0.00113 \text{ eV} $$

(b) The energy of $$ 10^9 $$ such photons:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{photons}} = 10^9 \times 1.13 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} = 1.13 \times 10^6 \text{ eV} = 1.13 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

(c) The rest mass energy of a particle with half the proton mass:
<div class="equation">
$$ E = mc^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_p c^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 938.3 \text{ MeV} = 469 \text{ MeV} $$

Yes, this implies that space is **"matter dominated"** because the energy density in matter is about 415 times greater than the energy density in radiation.

(a) The CMBR photons are very low energy: only **0.00113 eV** (or 1.13 meV). This is characteristic of microwave radiation from a blackbody at 2.7 K, confirming that the primordial fireball has cooled dramatically since the Big Bang.

(b) Even though there are a billion photons for each massive particle, their combined energy is only **1.13 MeV** due to their individual low energies. This demonstrates that while photons vastly outnumber massive particles in the universe, their total energy contribution is limited by their low individual energies.

(c) A single particle with half the proton's mass has a rest energy of **469 MeV**, which is much larger than the combined energy of a billion CMBR photons.

(d) The universe today is indeed **matter-dominated**: the energy density in matter exceeds that in radiation by a factor of about 400. However, this wasn't always the case! In the early universe, when temperatures were much higher, photons had much more energy, and radiation dominated. The transition from radiation-dominated to matter-dominated occurred about 50,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently that the energy density in matter began to exceed that in radiation. This transition is a crucial epoch in cosmology because it affects how structure formation proceeded. The fact that we live in a matter-dominated era means that gravity acting on matter (both ordinary and dark) is the primary driver of cosmic structure, allowing galaxies, stars, and planets to form. Interestingly, even though matter dominates over radiation today, recent evidence suggests that dark energy now dominates over matter, making our current era "dark energy dominated."

Show that the velocity of a star orbiting its galaxy in a circular orbit is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the mass of the stars inside its orbit acts like a single mass at the center of the galaxy. You may use an equation from a previous chapter to support your conclusion, but you must justify its use and define all terms used.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a star in a circular orbit around the galactic center, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force needed to maintain the circular motion. We'll equate these two forces and solve for the orbital velocity. By examining how velocity depends on radius, we can demonstrate the inverse square root relationship.

**Solution**

Consider a star of mass $$ m $$ orbiting at radius $$ r $$ from the galactic center with orbital speed $$ v $$. Let $$ M $$ be the total mass of all stars within the orbit, which we treat as concentrated at the galactic center.

The gravitational force on the star is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$
</div>

where $$ G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N·m}^2\text{/kg}^2 $$ is the gravitational constant.

For circular motion, the required centripetal force is:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{cent}} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$
</div>

This equation comes from Newton's second law applied to circular motion, where the centripetal acceleration is $$ a_c = v^2/r $$.

Setting the gravitational force equal to the centripetal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$
</div>

Canceling $$ m $$ from both sides and multiplying both sides by $$ r $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{GM}{r} = v^2 $$
</div>

Solving for $$ v $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = \sqrt{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}} $$
</div>

This can be written as:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{k}{\sqrt{r}} $$
</div>

where $$ k = \sqrt{GM} $$ is a constant (assuming $$ M $$ is constant).

Therefore, **the orbital velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius**: $$ v \propto r^{-1/2} $$ or $$ v \propto 1/\sqrt{r} $$.

**Discussion**

This derivation shows that for a star orbiting a galaxy, if all the mass interior to the orbit can be treated as concentrated at the center, then the orbital velocity should decrease as we move farther from the galactic center, following a $$ 1/\sqrt{r} $$ relationship. This is exactly analogous to planetary motion in our solar system, where planets farther from the Sun orbit more slowly according to Kepler's laws.

However, this prediction is **not** what astronomers observe when they measure galactic rotation curves! Actual observations show that the orbital velocities of stars remain roughly constant (or even slightly increase) at large radii, rather than decreasing as $$ 1/\sqrt{r} $$. This discrepancy is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark matter. The flat rotation curves can be explained if there is a massive dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, such that the mass $$ M $$ enclosed within radius $$ r $$ continues to increase with radius, rather than remaining constant. If $$ M \propto r $$, then $$ v = \sqrt{GM/r} \propto \sqrt{r/r} = \text{constant} $$, which matches observations. The study of galactic rotation curves has therefore revealed that galaxies contain far more mass than can be accounted for by visible stars, gas, and dust—this additional mass is the mysterious dark matter that makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe.

Using data from the previous problem, find the increase in rotational kinetic energy, given the core's mass is 1.3 times that of our Sun. Where does this increase in kinetic energy come from?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to calculate the rotational kinetic energy before and after the collapse using $$ KE_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 $$, where the moment of inertia for a sphere is $$ I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2 $$. From the previous problem, we know the initial and final radii and angular velocities. The increase in kinetic energy comes from gravitational potential energy released during the collapse.

**Solution**

From the previous problem:
- Initial radius: $$ R_i = 5.0 \times 10^5 \text{ km} = 5.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m} $$
- Final radius: $$ R_f = 10.0 \text{ km} = 1.0 \times 10^4 \text{ m} $$
- Initial angular velocity: $$ \omega_i = \frac{1 \text{ rev}}{30.0 \text{ days}} = \frac{2\pi}{30.0 \times 24 \times 3600} = 2.42 \times 10^{-6} \text{ rad/s} $$
- Final angular velocity: $$ \omega_f = 960 \text{ rev/s} = 960 \times 2\pi = 6030 \text{ rad/s} $$
- Mass: $$ M = 1.3 M_{\text{Sun}} = 1.3 \times 2.0 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} = 2.6 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} $$

Initial moment of inertia:
<div class="equation">
$$ I_i = \frac{2}{5}MR_i^2 = \frac{2}{5}(2.6 \times 10^{30})(5.0 \times 10^8)^2 = 2.6 \times 10^{47} \text{ kg·m}^2 $$
</div>

Initial rotational kinetic energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ KE_i = \frac{1}{2}I_i\omega_i^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2.6 \times 10^{47})(2.42 \times 10^{-6})^2 = 7.6 \times 10^{35} \text{ J} $$
</div>

Final moment of inertia:
<div class="equation">
$$ I_f = \frac{2}{5}MR_f^2 = \frac{2}{5}(2.6 \times 10^{30})(1.0 \times 10^4)^2 = 1.04 \times 10^{38} \text{ kg·m}^2 $$
</div>

Final rotational kinetic energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ KE_f = \frac{1}{2}I_f\omega_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1.04 \times 10^{38})(6030)^2 = 1.9 \times 10^{45} \text{ J} $$
</div>

Increase in rotational kinetic energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i = 1.9 \times 10^{45} - 7.6 \times 10^{35} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{45} \text{ J} $$
</div>

(Note that $$ KE_i $$ is negligible compared to $$ KE_f $$.)

**Where does this energy come from?** This enormous increase in rotational kinetic energy comes from **gravitational potential energy** released during the collapse of the core.

**Discussion**

The increase in rotational kinetic energy is approximately **1.9 × 10⁴⁵ J**, which is an absolutely staggering amount of energy. To put this in perspective, this is about 100,000 times the energy our Sun will radiate over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime! The initial rotational kinetic energy (7.6 × 10³⁵ J) is completely negligible compared to the final value, demonstrating the dramatic acceleration that occurs during collapse.

This energy comes from gravitational potential energy released as the core contracts. When a star's core collapses during a supernova, it falls inward under its own gravity, releasing enormous amounts of gravitational potential energy. Most of this energy (about 99%) is actually carried away by neutrinos, but some goes into the kinetic energy of the explosion, heating the surrounding material, and—as we see here—into rotational kinetic energy. Because angular momentum is conserved during the collapse ($$ L = I\omega = \text{constant} $$), as the moment of inertia decreases by a factor of about $$ 10^9 $$ (due to the radius shrinking by a factor of 50,000), the angular velocity must increase by the same factor. This results in the spectacular increase in rotational kinetic energy we calculated.

Neutron stars are among the fastest-rotating objects in the universe, and pulsars (rotating neutron stars that emit beams of radiation) can spin hundreds of times per second, as in this problem. The regular pulses we detect from pulsars are like cosmic lighthouses, and they are among the most precise clocks in nature. Some millisecond pulsars are even more stable than atomic clocks over certain time scales!

(a) Use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to calculate the uncertainty in energy for a corresponding time interval of  $$ 10^{-43} \text{s} $$ .
 (b) Compare this energy with the  $$ 10^{19} \text{GeV} $$
 unification-of-forces energy and discuss why they are similar.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relating energy and time states that $$ \Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar/2 $$, where $$ \hbar = h/(2\pi) $$ is the reduced Planck constant. We can rearrange this to find the minimum energy uncertainty for a given time interval.

(b) We'll compare our calculated energy with the unification energy and explain the physical significance of the time interval $$ 10^{-43} \text{ s} $$, which is the Planck time.

**Solution**

(a) The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$
</div>

where $$ \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi} = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$.

For the minimum uncertainty:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-43} \text{ s}} = 5.28 \times 10^{8} \text{ J} $$
</div>

Converting to GeV (using $$ 1 \text{ GeV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J} $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = \frac{5.28 \times 10^{8} \text{ J}}{1.60 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J/GeV}} = 3.3 \times 10^{18} \text{ GeV} $$
</div>

(b) Comparing with the unification energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{\Delta E}{E_{\text{unification}}} = \frac{3.3 \times 10^{18} \text{ GeV}}{10^{19} \text{ GeV}} \approx 0.3 $$
</div>

The calculated energy uncertainty is **of the same order of magnitude** as the unification-of-forces energy (within a factor of 3).

**Discussion**

The remarkable similarity between these two energies is not a coincidence—it reveals a profound connection between quantum mechanics, gravity, and the fundamental structure of spacetime. The time interval $$ 10^{-43} \text{ s} $$ is known as the **Planck time**, the fundamental quantum timescale below which our current understanding of physics breaks down. It is defined as:

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{Planck}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \text{ s} $$
</div>

At this timescale, quantum fluctuations in spacetime itself become significant, and a complete theory of quantum gravity (Theory of Everything) would be needed to describe physics. The corresponding energy scale, called the **Planck energy**, is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{Planck}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{19} \text{ GeV} $$
</div>

This is exactly the energy scale at which all four fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational) are expected to unify into a single superforce! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle provides the bridge: for processes occurring on the Planck timescale, the energy uncertainty is necessarily on the order of the Planck energy.

This connection tells us that the TOE epoch immediately after the Big Bang (before $$ 10^{-43} \text{ s} $$) was governed by physics at the Planck scale, where spacetime itself was subject to violent quantum fluctuations. At these energies and timescales, the distinctions between forces disappear, and the universe was truly unified. The fact that these fundamental scales emerge from combining the constants of quantum mechanics ($$ \hbar $$), gravity ($$ G $$), and relativity ($$ c $$) suggests that a complete theory of nature must incorporate all three domains—which is exactly what physicists are striving to achieve with theories like string theory and loop quantum gravity.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Sample Problem**

Astronomers observe a star in a circular orbit at the outer edge of a spiral galaxy. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that the star is moving at a velocity of 220 km/s, and its distance from the galactic center is measured to be 50,000 light years. Calculate the mass of the galaxy (a) in kilograms, and (b) in multiples of the solar mass. Assume all the galaxy's mass is contained within the star's orbit and acts as if concentrated at the galactic center.

**Strategy**

For a star in circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force. Setting these equal gives us $$ GMm/r^2 = mv^2/r $$, which simplifies to $$ M = v^2r/G $$. We need to convert the distance to meters, calculate the mass in kilograms, then convert to solar masses.

**Solution**

Given information:
- Orbital velocity: $$ v = 220 \text{ km/s} = 2.20 \times 10^5 \text{ m/s} $$
- Orbital radius: $$ r = 50{,}000 \text{ ly} $$

Convert the radius to meters:
<div class="equation">
$$ r = 50{,}000 \text{ ly} \times 9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m/ly} = 4.73 \times 10^{20} \text{ m} $$
</div>

From the condition that gravitational force equals centripetal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$
</div>

Solving for the galactic mass $$ M $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{v^2 r}{G} $$
</div>

(a) Substituting values (with $$ G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N·m}^2\text{/kg}^2 $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{(2.20 \times 10^5)^2 \times 4.73 \times 10^{20}}{6.67 \times 10^{-11}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{4.84 \times 10^{10} \times 4.73 \times 10^{20}}{6.67 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{2.29 \times 10^{31}}{6.67 \times 10^{-11}} = 3.4 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

(b) Converting to solar masses (using $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = 2.0 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{3.4 \times 10^{41} \text{ kg}}{2.0 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}} = 1.7 \times 10^{11} M_{\text{Sun}} $$
</div>

**Answer:** The mass of the galaxy is **(a) 3.4 × 10⁴¹ kg** and **(b) 1.7 × 10¹¹ solar masses** (or 170 billion solar masses).

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates how astronomers determine galactic masses using orbital dynamics. The calculated mass of 170 billion solar masses is typical for a large spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. This method, based on Newtonian mechanics, is remarkably powerful—it allows us to "weigh" entire galaxies from Earth by observing the motion of stars or gas clouds at their edges.

However, this calculation reveals only the mass within the star's orbit. Additional mass may exist beyond this radius, which is why astronomers study rotation curves at various distances to build up a complete picture of a galaxy's mass distribution. When this analysis is performed for most galaxies, a surprising result emerges: the orbital velocities of stars remain nearly constant (or even increase slightly) at large radii, rather than decreasing as expected from the visible matter distribution. This observation, first made by astronomer Vera Rubin in the 1970s, provided some of the strongest evidence for dark matter—invisible matter that extends far beyond the visible edges of galaxies in massive halos.

Students constructing their own version of this problem should choose reasonable values: orbital velocities typically range from 150-300 km/s for spiral galaxies, and orbital radii from 10,000 to 100,000 light years. The resulting masses should be on the order of 10¹⁰ to 10¹² solar masses for typical galaxies. This exercise reinforces the connection between observable kinematics and invisible mass—a fundamental technique in modern astrophysics.
