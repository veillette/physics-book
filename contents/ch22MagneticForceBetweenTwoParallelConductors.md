* Describe the effects of the magnetic force between two conductors.
* Calculate the force between two parallel conductors.
</div>

You might expect that there are significant forces between current-carrying
wires, since ordinary currents produce significant magnetic fields and these
fields exert significant forces on ordinary currents. But you might not expect
that the force between wires is used to *define* the ampere. It might also
surprise you to learn that this force has something to do with why large circuit
breakers burn up when they attempt to interrupt large currents.

The force between two long straight and parallel conductors separated by a
distance $$r $$ can be found by applying what we have developed in preceding
sections. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows the wires, their currents, the fields
they create, and the subsequent forces they exert on one another. Let us
consider the field produced by wire 1 and the force it exerts on wire 2 (call
the force $${F}_{2} $$ ). The field due to $${I}_{1} $$ at a distance $$r $$ is
given to be

<div class="equation" >
 $${B}_{1}=\frac{ {\mu }_{0}{I}_{1}}{2 \pi r}\text{.} $$
</div>

![Figure a shows two parallel wires, both with currents going up. The magnetic field lines of the first wire are shown as concentric circles centered on wire 1 and in a plane perpendicular to the wires. The magnetic field is in the counter clockwise direction as viewed from above. Figure b shows a view from above and shows the current-carrying wires as two dots. Around wire one is a circle that represents a magnetic field line due to that wire. The magnetic field passes directly through wire two. The magnetic field is in the counter clockwise direction. The force on wire two is to the left, toward wire one.](../resources/Figure_22_10_01a.jpg "(a) The magnetic field produced by a long straight conductor is perpendicular to a parallel conductor, as indicated by RHR-2. (b) A view from above of the two wires shown in (a), with one magnetic field line shown for each wire. RHR-1 shows that the force between the parallel conductors is attractive when the currents are in the same direction. A similar analysis shows that the force is repulsive between currents in opposite directions.")
{ #Figure1}

This field is uniform along wire 2 and perpendicular to it, and so the force
$${F}_{2} $$ it exerts on wire 2 is given by $$F= IlB \sin \theta $$ with $$\sin
\theta =1 $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{2}={I}_{2} l B_{1}. $$
</div>

By Newton’s third law, the forces on the wires are equal in magnitude, and so we
just write $$F $$ for the magnitude of $${F}_{2} $$ .
(Note that $${F}_{1}=-{F}_{2} $$ .)
Since the wires are very long, it is convenient to think in terms of $$F/l $$ ,
the force per unit length. Substituting the expression for $${B}_{1} $$ into the
last equation and rearranging terms gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{F}{l}=\frac{ {\mu }_{0}{I}_{1}{I}_{2}}{2 \pi r}\text{.} $$
</div>

$$F/l $$ is the force per unit length between two parallel currents $${I}_{1} $$
and $${I}_{2} $$ separated by a distance $$r $$ . The force is attractive if the
currents are in the same direction and repulsive if they are in opposite
directions.

This force is responsible for the *pinch effect* in electric arcs and plasmas.
The force exists whether the currents are in wires or not. In an electric arc,
where currents are moving parallel to one another, there is an attraction that
squeezes currents into a smaller tube. In large circuit breakers, like those
used in neighborhood power distribution systems, the pinch effect can
concentrate an arc between plates of a switch trying to break a large current,
burn holes, and even ignite the equipment. Another example of the pinch effect
is found in the solar plasma, where jets of ionized material, such as solar
flares, are shaped by magnetic forces.

The *operational definition of the ampere* is based on the force between
current-carrying wires. Note that for parallel wires separated by 1 meter with
each carrying 1 ampere, the force per meter is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{F}{l}=\frac{\left(4\pi  \times 10^{-7} \text{T}\cdot \text{m/A}\right){\left(1 A\right)}^{2}}{\left(2\pi \right)\left(1 m\right)}=2 \times 10^{-7}  \text{N/m} \text{.}  $$
</div>

Since $${\mu }_{0} $$ is exactly $$4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{T}\cdot \text{m/A}
$$ by definition, and because $$1 \text{T}=1 \text{N/}\left(\text{A} \cdot
\text{m}\right) $$ , the force per meter is exactly $$2 \times 10^{-7}
\text{N/m} $$ . This is the basis of the operational definition of the ampere.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
The Ampere
</div>
The official definition of the ampere is:

One ampere of current through each of two parallel conductors of infinite
length, separated by one meter in empty space free of other magnetic fields,
causes a force of exactly $$2 \times 10^{-7} \text{N/m} $$ on each conductor.

</div>

Infinite-length straight wires are impractical and so, in practice, a current
balance is constructed with coils of wire separated by a few centimeters. Force
is measured to determine current. This also provides us with a method for
measuring the coulomb. We measure the charge that flows for a current of one
ampere in one second. That is, $$1 \text{C} =1 \text{A} \cdot \text{s} $$ . For
both the ampere and the coulomb, the method of measuring force between
conductors is the most accurate in practice.

### Section Summary

* The force between two parallel currents $${I}_{1} $$ and $${I}_{2} $$,
  separated by a distance $$r $$ , has a magnitude per unit length given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{F}{l}=\frac{ {\mu }_{0}{I}_{1}{I}_{2}}{2 \pi r}. $$
  </div>

* The force is attractive if the currents are in the same direction, repulsive
  if they are in opposite directions.
