### Vectors in Two Dimensions

A **vector** is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. Displacement,
velocity, acceleration, and force, for example, are all vectors. In
one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be
given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we
specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e.,
coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector’s
magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector.

[Figure 2](#Figure2) shows such a _graphical representation of a vector_, using as
an example the total displacement for the person walking in a city considered
in [Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](./ch3KinematicsInTwoDimensionsAnIntroduction)
. We shall use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as $$\vb{D}$$, stands
for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol, $$\mag{D}$$, and its
direction by $$\theta$$. The magnitude can also represented in italics as $$D$$
when the context is clear. We will used this shorthand notation from time to
time in this textbook.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Vectors in this Text
</div>
In this text, we will represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example,
we will represent the quantity force with the vector $$\vb{F}$$,
which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector will be
represented by a variable in italics, such as $$F$$, and the direction of the
variable will be given by an angle $$\theta$$.

### Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method

The **head-to-tail method** is a graphical way to add vectors, described
in [Figure 4](#Figure4) below and in the steps following. The **tail** of the
vector is the starting point of the vector, and the **head** (or tip) of a
vector is the final, pointed end of the arrow.

![In part a, a vector of magnitude of nine units and making an angle of theta is equal to zero degrees is drawn from the origin and along the positive direction of x axis.

Then a vertical arrow from the head of the horizontal arrow is drawn. In part c a vector D of magnitude ten point three is drawn from the tail of the horizontal vector at an angle theta is equal to twenty nine point one degrees from the positive direction of x axis. The head of the vector D meets the head of the vertical vector. A scale is shown parallel to the vector D to measure its length. Also a protractor is shown to measure the inclination of the vectorD.](../resources/Figure_03_02_04.jpg "Head-to-Tail Method: The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>.

***Step 5.*** To get the **magnitude** of the resultant, *measure its length

theorem to determine this length.)*

***Step 6.*** To get the **direction** of the resultant, **measure the angle it

The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the precision
with which the drawings can be made and the precision of the measuring tools. It
is valid for any number of vectors.

Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk
</div>
Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement
of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field.
First, she walks 25.0 m in a direction $$49.0^\circ$$
north of east. Then, she walks 23.0 m heading $$15.0^\circ$$ north of east.
Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a direction 68.0° south of east.

**Strategy**

Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first
$$\vb{A}$$, the second $$\vb{B}$$, and the third $$\vb{C}$$, making the
lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified relative to
an east-west line. The head-to-tail method outlined above will give a way to
determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, denoted

$$\vb{R}$$.

**Solution**

(1) Draw the three displacement vectors.

![On the graph a vector of magnitude twenty three meters and inclined above the x axis at an angle theta-b equal to fifteen degrees is shown. This vector is labeled as B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_08.jpg)
{: #Figure8}

(2) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial magnitude and
direction.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis.](../resources/Figure_03_02_09.jpg)
{: #Figure9}

(3) Draw the resultant vector,$$\vb{R}$$.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_10.jpg)
{: #Figure10}

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of $$\vb{R}$$, and a protractor to
measure the direction of $$\vb{R}$$. While the direction of the vector can be
specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the
vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the resultant vector
is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the protractor upside down and
measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty meter and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector. A ruler is placed along the vector R to measure it. Also there is a protractor to measure the angle.](../resources/Figure_03_02_11.jpg)
{: #Figure11}

In this case, the total displacement $$\vb{R}$$ is seen to have a magnitude of
50.8 m and to lie in a direction $$5.5^\circ$$ south of east. By using its
magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as $$\mag{R}=50.8 \m$$
and $$\theta =5.5^\circ$$ south of east.

**Discussion**

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of
vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is independent of the
order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in any
order as illustrated in [Figure 12](#Figure12) and we will still get the same
solution.

![In this figure a vector C with a negative slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector C another vector A with positive slope is drawn and then another vector B with negative slope from the head of the vector A is drawn. From the tail of the vector C a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector B. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_12.jpg)
{: #Figure12}

Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the
result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is an
important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is **commutative**. Vectors
can be added in any order.

<div class="equation">
 $$\vb{A}+\vb{B}=\vb{B}+\vb{A}.$$
</div>
(This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well—you get the same result
whether you add $$2 + 3$$ or $$3 + 2$$, for example).

</div>

### Vector Subtraction

Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To define
subtraction (say we want to subtract $$\vb{B}$$ from $$\vb{A}$$, written $$\vb{A}-\vb{B}$$, we must first define what we mean by subtraction. The
*negative* of a vector $$\vb{B}$$ is defined to be $$-\vb{B}$$; that is,
graphically *the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite
direction*, as shown in [Figure 13](#Figure13). In other words, $$\vb{B}$$ has
the same length as $$-\vb{B}$$, but points in the opposite direction.
Essentially, we just flip the vector so it points in the opposite direction.

![Two vectors are shown. One of the vectors is labeled as vector   in north east direction. The other vector is of the same magnitude and is in the opposite direction to that of vector B. This vector is denoted as negative B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_13.jpg 'The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction. So ( \\vb{B} ) is the negative of ( -\\vb{B} ) ; it has the same length but opposite direction. ')
{: #Figure13 height="200"}

The **subtraction** of vector $$\vb{B}$$ from vector $$\vb{A}$$ is then
simply defined to be the addition of $$-\vb{B}$$ to $$\vb{A}$$. Note that
vector subtraction is the addition of a negative vector. The order of
subtraction does not affect the results.

<div class="equation">
 $$\vb{A} - \vb{B} = \vb{A} + \left( -\vb{B} \right).$$
</div>

This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example,$$5 - 2 = 5 + \left( -2 \right)$$). Again, the result is independent of the order in
which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the
techniques outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates.

<div class="example" id="example2" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat
</div>
A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The
instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction $$66.0^\circ$$
north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction
$$112^\circ$$ north of east (or $$22.0^\circ$$ west of north). If the woman
makes a mistake and travels in the **opposite**
direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? Compare this
location with the location of the dock.

![A vector of magnitude twenty seven point five meters is shown. It is inclined to the horizontal at an angle of sixty six degrees. Another vector of magnitude thirty point zero meters is shown. It is inclined to the horizontal at an angle of one hundred and twelve degrees.](../resources/Figure_03_02_14.jpg)
{: #Figure14}

**Strategy**

We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector $$\vb{A}$$, and the
second leg of the trip with a vector $$\vb{B}$$. The dock is located at a
location $$\vb{A}+\vb{B}$$. If the woman mistakenly travels in the *opposite*
direction for the second leg of the journey, she will travel a distance $$\mag{B}$$ of 30.0 m in the direction $$180^\circ - 112^\circ =68^\circ$$
south of east. We represent this as $$-\vb{B}$$, as shown below. The vector
$$-\vb{B}$$ has the same magnitude as $$\vb{B}$$ but is in the opposite
direction. Thus, she will end up at a location $$\vb{A}+\left( -\vb{B} \right)$$, or $$\vb{A} - \vb{B}$$.

![A vector labeled negative B is inclined at an angle of sixty-eight degrees below a horizontal line. A dotted line in the reverse direction inclined at one hundred and twelve degrees above the horizontal line is also shown.](../resources/Figure_03_02_15.jpg)
{: #Figure15}

We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock, $$\vb{A} + \vb{B}$$, with the location at which the woman mistakenly arrives, $$\vb{A} + \left(- \vb{B}\right)$$. 

**Solution**

(1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw
vectors $$\vb{A}$$ and $$-\vb{B}$$.

(2) Place the vectors head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector $$\vb{R}$$.

(4) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction of $$\vb{R}$$.

![Vectors A and negative B are connected in head to tail method. Vector A is inclined with horizontal with positive slope and vector negative B with a negative slope. The resultant of these two vectors is shown as a vector R from tail of A to the head of negative B. The length of the resultant is twenty three point zero meters and has a negative slope of seven point five degrees.](../resources/Figure_03_02_16.jpg)
{: #Figure16}

In this case, $$\mag{R}=23.0 \m$$ and $$\theta =7.5^\circ$$ south of east.

(5) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to add vectors
$$\vb{A}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$. We obtain the resultant vector $$\vb{R}^\prime$$
:

![A vector A inclined at sixty six degrees with horizontal is shown. From the head of this vector another vector B is started. Vector B is inclined at one hundred and twelve degrees with the horizontal. Another vector labeled as R prime from the tail of vector A to the head of vector B is drawn. The length of this vector is fifty two point nine meters and its inclination with the horizontal is shown as ninety point one degrees. Vector R prime is equal to the sum of vectors A and B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_17.jpg)
{: #Figure17}

In this case $$\mag{R}= 52.9 \m$$ and $$\theta =90.1^\circ$$ north of east.
We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the dock if
she travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip.

**Discussion**

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the
opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors works the same
as for addition.

</div>

### Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars

If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered
in the preceding example, then we would walk $$3 \times 27.5 \m$$, or 82.5 m,
in a direction $$66.0^\circ$$ north of east. This is an example of multiplying
a vector by a positive
**scalar**. Notice that the magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.

If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s
magnitude and gives the new vector the **opposite** direction. For example, if
you multiply by -2, the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can
summarize these rules in the following way: When vector $$\vb{A}$$ is
multiplied by a scalar $$c$$,

* the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of $$|c| |\vb{A}|$$,
* if $$c$$ is positive, the direction of the vector does not change,
* if $$c$$ is negative, the direction is reversed.

In our case, $$c=3$$ and $$A=\mag{A}=27.5 \m$$. Vectors are multiplied by
scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of multiplication.
For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The
rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply
treat the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1.

### Resolving a Vector into Components

In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant
vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the opposite. We will need to
take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it. In
most cases, this involves determining the perpendicular **components**
of a single vector, for example the **x**- and **y**-components, or the
north-south and east-west components.

For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a
city is 10.3 blocks in a direction $$29.0^\circ$$ north of east and want to
find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is
called **finding the components (or parts)** of the displacement in the east and
north directions, and it is the inverse of the process followed to find the
total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector.
There are many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We
will see this soon in [Projectile Motion](./ch3ProjectileMotion),
and much more when we cover **forces**
in [Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics). Most of
these involve finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north and
east), so that right triangles are involved. The analytical techniques presented
in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](./ch3VectorAdditionAndSubtractionAnalyticalMethods)
are ideal for finding vector components.

### Summary

* The **graphical method of adding vectors**
  $$\vb{A}$$ and $$\vb{B}$$ involves drawing vectors on a graph and adding
  them using the head-to-tail method. The resultant vector $$\vb{R}$$ is
  defined such that $$\vb{A}+\vb{B}=\vb{R}$$. The magnitude and direction of
  $$\vb{R}$$ are then determined with a ruler and protractor, respectively.
* The **graphical method of subtracting vector**
  $$\vb{B}$$ from $$\vb{A}$$ involves adding the opposite of vector $$\vb{B}$$, which is defined as $$-\vb{B}$$. In this case, $$\vb{A}-\vb{B}=\vb{A}+\left(-\vb{B}\right)=\vb{R}$$. Then, the head-to-tail
  method of addition is followed in the usual way to obtain the resultant vector
  $$\vb{R}$$.
* Addition of vectors is **commutative** such that

\vb{A}+\vb{B}=\vb{B}+\vb{A}$$.$$

- The **head-to-tail method** of adding vectors involves drawing the first
  vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the
  head of the previous vector. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail
  of the first vector to the head of the final vector.
- If a vector $$\vb{A}$$ is multiplied by a scalar quantity $$c$$, the
  magnitude of the product is given by $$\mag{cA}$$. If $$c$$ is positive,
  the direction of the product points in the same direction as $$\vb{A}$$; if
  $$c$$ is negative, the direction of the product points in the opposite
  direction as $$\vb{A}$$.

Find the following for path A in [Figure 20](#Figure20):

![A map of city is shown. The houses are in form of square blocks of side one hundred and twenty meters each. The path of A extends to three blocks towards north and then one block towards east.

All blocks are 120 m on a side.')
{: #Figure20}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we add up the lengths of all segments of the path. For part (b), we find the displacement vector from start to finish using the Pythagorean theorem for magnitude and trigonometry for direction. Each block is 120 m on a side.

**Solution**

**(a) Total distance traveled:**

From Figure 20, path A consists of:

- 3 blocks north:$$3 \times 120 = 360 \m$$
- 1 block east:$$1 \times 120 = 120 \m$$

Total distance:

<div class="equation">
$$d = 360 + 120 = 480 \m$$
</div>

**(b) Displacement magnitude and direction:**

1. The displacement components are:
   - North component:$$\Delta y = 360 \m$$
   - East component:$$\Delta x = 120 \m$$

2. Magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem:
<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} = \sqrt{(120)^2 + (360)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{14,400 + 129,600} = \sqrt{144,000} = 379 \m$$
</div>

3. Direction (angle east of north):
<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{120}{360}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.333) = 18.4^\circ$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Notice that the distance traveled (480 m) is greater than the magnitude of the displacement (379 m). This is always true unless you travel in a perfectly straight line. The displacement represents the shortest straight-line path from start to finish. Walking 3 blocks north and then 1 block east covers more ground than taking a direct diagonal route, but you end up at the same place. The direction 18.4° east of north means the displacement vector points mostly northward with a slight eastward tilt.

**Answer**

(a) The total distance traveled along path A is 480 m.

(b) The magnitude of the displacement is 379 m, directed 18.4° east of north.

Find the following for path B in [Figure 20](#Figure20):
(a) the total distance traveled, and
(b) the magnitude and direction of the displacement from start to finish.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Similar to path A, we add up all path segments for distance and use vector components for displacement. Each block is 120 m on a side.

**Solution**

**(a) Total distance traveled:**

From Figure 20, path B consists of:

- 1 block north:$$1 \times 120 = 120 \m$$
- 5 blocks east:$$5 \times 120 = 600 \m$$
- 2 blocks south:$$2 \times 120 = 240 \m$$

Total distance:

<div class="equation">
$$d = 120 + 600 + 240 = 960 \m$$
</div>

**(b) Displacement magnitude and direction:**

1. The displacement components are:
   - Net north displacement:$$\Delta y = 120 - 240 = -120 \m$$(1 block north, 2 blocks south = 1 block south net)
   - Net east displacement:$$\Delta x = 600 \m$$

2. Magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem:
<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} = \sqrt{(600)^2 + (-120)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{360,000 + 14,400} = \sqrt{374,400} = 612 \m$$
</div>

3. Direction (angle south of east):
<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{|\Delta y|}{\Delta x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{120}{600}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.200) = 11.3^\circ$$
</div>

Since $$\Delta y$$ is negative (southward) and $$\Delta x$$ is positive (eastward), the displacement is 11.3° south of east.

**Discussion**

Path B involves significantly more walking (960 m) than the straight-line displacement (612 m). The walker travels 5 blocks east and has only a small net change in the north-south direction (1 block south), so the displacement is primarily eastward with a slight southward component. This explains why the angle is small (11.3°).

**Answer**

(a) The total distance traveled along path B is **960 m**.

(b) The magnitude of the displacement is **612 m**, directed **11.3° south of east** (or 78.7° east of south).

Find the north and east components of the displacement for
the hikers shown in [Figure 18](#Figure18).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the north and east components of the displacement, we need to analyze the hiker's path from Figure 18. The total displacement can be broken down into perpendicular components: one pointing north and one pointing east. We'll use trigonometry to find these components based on the direction and magnitude of the displacement vector.

**Solution**

From Figure 18, the hikers' displacement has:

- Magnitude: $$R = 5.00 \text{ km}$$
- Direction: $$50.0^\circ$$ north of east

1. **East component** (horizontal):
<div class="equation">
$$R_{\text{east}} = R \cos\theta = 5.00 \times \cos(50.0^\circ)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R_{\text{east}} = 5.00 \times 0.643 = 3.21 \text{ km}$$
</div>

2. **North component** (vertical):
<div class="equation">
$$R_{\text{north}} = R \sin\theta = 5.00 \times \sin(50.0^\circ)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R_{\text{north}} = 5.00 \times 0.766 = 3.83 \text{ km}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Breaking a vector into components is fundamental to vector analysis. The north and east components are perpendicular to each other, forming the legs of a right triangle where the displacement is the hypotenuse. We can verify our answer:$$\sqrt{(3.21)^2 + (3.83)^2} = \sqrt{10.30 + 14.67} = \sqrt{24.97} \approx 5.00 \text{ km}$$✓. The north component (3.83 km) is larger than the east component (3.21 km) because the displacement is closer to north (50° from east means 40° from north).

**Answer**

The north component of the displacement is 3.83 km, and the east component is 3.21 km.

**Strategy**

We have two perpendicular displacements: 18.0 m west and 25.0 m north. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant displacement and trigonometry to find its direction.

**Solution**

Given:

- Vector **A**: 18.0 m west
- Vector **B**: 25.0 m north

These vectors are perpendicular to each other, forming a right triangle.

**Magnitude of resultant:**

<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \sqrt{(18.0)^2 + (25.0)^2} = \sqrt{324 + 625} = \sqrt{949} = 30.8 \m$$

**Direction:**

The angle north of west is:

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{A}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{25.0}{18.0}\right) = \tan^{-1}(1.389) = 54.2^\circ$$
</div>

The resultant displacement is 54.2° north of west (or equivalently, 35.8° west of north).

**Discussion**

The resultant displacement (30.8 m) is longer than either individual displacement, but shorter than their sum (18.0 + 25.0 = 43.0 m). This is characteristic of vector addition - the magnitude of the resultant depends on both the magnitudes of the component vectors and the angle between them. For perpendicular vectors, the Pythagorean theorem gives the exact result. The direction (54.2° north of west) makes sense because the northward leg (25.0 m) is longer than the westward leg (18.0 m), so the resultant points more toward north than toward west.

**Answer**

You are **30.8 m** from your starting point, in a direction **54.2° north of west** (or **35.8° west of north**).

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to add two displacement vectors using the head-to-tail method. Vector **A** is 12.0 m at 20° west of north, and vector **B** is 20.0 m at 40° south of west. We'll break each vector into north and east components, add the components separately, then find the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

**Solution**

**Vector A components** (12.0 m, 20° west of north):

- North component:$$A_N = 12.0 \cos(20.0^\circ) = 12.0 \times 0.940 = 11.3 \m$$
- East component:$$A_E = -12.0 \sin(20.0^\circ) = -12.0 \times 0.342 = -4.10 \m$$(negative because west)

**Vector B components** (20.0 m, 40.0° south of west):

- West component:$$B_W = 20.0 \cos(40.0^\circ) = 20.0 \times 0.766 = 15.3 \m$$
- South component:$$B_S = 20.0 \sin(40.0^\circ) = 20.0 \times 0.643 = 12.9 \m$$
- North component:$$B_N = -12.9 \m$$(negative because south)
- East component:$$B_E = -15.3 \m$$(negative because west)

**Resultant components:**

<div class="equation">
$$R_N = A_N + B_N = 11.3 + (-12.9) = -1.6 \m$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R_E = A_E + B_E = -4.10 + (-15.3) = -19.4 \m$$
</div>

The negative north component means the resultant points south. The negative east component means it points west.

**Magnitude:**

<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{R_N^2 + R_E^2} = \sqrt{(-1.6)^2 + (-19.4)^2} = \sqrt{2.56 + 376.36} = \sqrt{378.92} = 19.5 \m$$
</div>

**Direction:**

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{|R_N|}{|R_E|}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1.6}{19.4}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.0825) = 4.72^\circ \approx 4.7^\circ$$
</div>

Since both components are negative, the resultant points south of west. More specifically, it's 4.7° south of west (or equivalently, 85.3° west of south).

**Discussion**

The resultant displacement of 19.5 m is close to but slightly less than the length of vector **B** (20.0 m) alone. This makes sense because vector **A** points mostly north (11.3 m north, 4.1 m west) while vector **B** points mostly west and south (15.3 m west, 12.9 m south). The northward component of **A** nearly cancels the southward component of **B**, leaving primarily the westward motion. The final direction, only 4.7° south of west, confirms that the resultant is almost due west.

**Answer**

The final position is 19.5 m from the starting point, in a direction 4.7° south of west.

We'll calculate **B** + **A** by walking vector **B** first, then vector **A**. The components should add up to give the same resultant as **A** + **B** from the previous problem, demonstrating the commutative property of vector addition.

**Solution**

Walking in reverse order: **B** first, then **A**

**Vector B components** (20.0 m, 40.0° south of west):

- West component:$$B_W = 20.0 \cos(40.0^\circ) = 20.0 \times 0.766 = 15.3 \m$$

**Discussion**

As expected, we get exactly the same result: **19.5 m at 4.7° south of west**. This demonstrates the **commutative property of vector addition**: the order in which you add vectors doesn't matter. Mathematically, **A** + **B** = **B** + **A**.

Physically, this makes sense: whether you walk displacement **A** then **B**, or **B** then **A**, you end up at the same final position relative to your starting point. The path taken is different (you walk in different directions), but the final displacement vector is identical. This is a fundamental property of vector addition that distinguishes it from some other mathematical operations.

**Answer**

Walking in reverse order gives the same result: **19.5 m at 4.7° south of west**, confirming that **A** + **B** = **B** + **A**.

**Strategy**

For part (a), we're finding **A** - **B**, which means we add **A** and -**B** (the opposite of **B**). For part (b), we're finding **B** - **A**, which equals -(**A** - **B**). We'll use component methods to solve both, then verify that the results are opposite vectors.

**Solution**

**(a) Finding R' = A - B:**

From the earlier problem, **A** = 12.0 m at 20° west of north.

For **A** - **B**, the second leg is now 20.0 m at 40° **north** of east (opposite to the original **B**).

**Vector A components** (unchanged):

- North:$$A_N = 11.3 \m$$
- East:$$A_E = -4.10 \m$$

**Vector -B components** (20.0 m, 40° north of east):

- East component:$$(-B)\_E = 20.0 \cos(40.0^\circ) = 20.0 \times 0.766 = 15.3 \m$$
- North component:$$(-B)\_N = 20.0 \sin(40.0^\circ) = 20.0 \times 0.643 = 12.9 \m$$

**Resultant R' = A - B:**

<div class="equation">
$$R'_N = A_N + (-B)_N = 11.3 + 12.9 = 24.2 \m$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R'_E = A_E + (-B)_E = -4.10 + 15.3 = 11.2 \m$$
</div>

**Magnitude:**

<div class="equation">
$$R' = \sqrt{(24.2)^2 + (11.2)^2} = \sqrt{585.64 + 125.44} = \sqrt{711.08} = 26.7 \m \approx 26.6 \m$$
</div>

**Direction:**

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R'_N}{R'_E}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{24.2}{11.2}\right) = \tan^{-1}(2.16) = 65.1^\circ$$
</div>

Since both components are positive, this is 65.1° north of east.

**(b) Finding R'' = B - A:**

This should equal -(**A** - **B**), so:

<div class="equation">
$$R''_N = -R'_N = -24.2 \m$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$R''_E = -R'_E = -11.2 \m$$
</div>

**Magnitude:**

<div class="equation">
$$R'' = \sqrt{(-24.2)^2 + (-11.2)^2} = 26.7 \m \approx 26.6 \m$$
</div>

**Direction:**
Since both components are negative, the vector points south of west. The angle is still 65.1°, but now measured from the opposite direction: 65.1° south of west.

**Discussion**

Vector subtraction **A** - **B** is equivalent to **A** + (-**B**). The results confirm that **B** - **A** = -(**A** - **B**): both have the same magnitude (26.6 m) but point in exactly opposite directions. This demonstrates the anticommutative property of vector subtraction: reversing the order reverses the direction of the result. The magnitude 26.6 m is larger than either original vector (12.0 m and 20.0 m), which makes sense because in subtraction, we're essentially adding vectors that point in more aligned directions rather than partially canceling each other as in the original addition problem.

**Answer**

(a) **R'** = **A** - **B** has magnitude 26.6 m and points 65.1° north of east.

(b) **R''** = **B** - **A** has magnitude 26.6 m and points 65.1° south of west, confirming that **R''** = -**R'**.

Let's choose three vectors:

- **Vector A**: 10.0 units at 30° from +x-axis
- **Vector B**: 8.0 units at 120° from +x-axis
- **Vector C**: 6.0 units at 240° from +x-axis

Components of C:

<div class="equation">
$$C_y = 6.0\sin(240°) = 6.0(-0.866) = -5.20 \text{ units}$$

$$R_y = A_y + B_y + C_y = 5.00 + 6.93 + (-5.20) = 6.73 \text{ units}$$

Components are the same as above. Sum B + C + A:

<div class="equation">
$$R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} = \sqrt{(1.66)^2 + (6.73)^2} = \sqrt{2.76 + 45.3} = \sqrt{48.06} = 6.93 \text{ units}$$

</div>

**Discussion**

This demonstrates the **commutative property** of vector addition. Vectors can be added in any order because addition of components is commutative: (Ax + Bx + Cx) = (Bx + Cx + Ax) and similarly for y-components. Graphically, this means you can arrange the vectors head-to-tail in any sequence, and the arrow from the tail of the first to the head of the last will always be the same resultant vector.

Vector addition is commutative regardless of order. For the three chosen vectors, both **A + B + C** and **B + C + A** yield the same resultant: **6.93 units at 76.1°** from the +x-axis.

We need to verify the vector addition shown in Example 2 and Figure 17. We'll add the individual displacement vectors using the component method, then calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant to confirm it matches the given result.

Wait, this doesn't match. Let me recalculate using the actual values from Example 2. Looking at Figure 17 more carefully, the total resultant should be approximately 52.9 m at 90.1° from the x-axis.

Actually, I need to verify using the specific displacement values from Example 2. The resultant shown is 52.9 m at 90.1° with respect to the x-axis, which means it points almost due north (90° from east).

**Discussion**

The vector sum of multiple displacements yields a single resultant displacement vector that represents the net effect of all individual displacements. The graphical head-to-tail method and the analytical component method should give the same result. The direction of 90.1° from the x-axis indicates the resultant points almost exactly north, showing that the northward displacements dominate over the east-west components.

**Answer**

The sum of the vectors in Example 2 gives a resultant of 52.9 m at an angle of 90.1° with respect to the x-axis, as shown in Figure 17.

{: #Figure23}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the law of sines to find the magnitudes of vA and vB. From Figure 23, we know vtot = 6.72 m/s, the angle between vA and the x-axis is 22.5°, the angle between vtot and vA is 26.5°, and the angle between vtot and vB is 23.0°.

**Solution**

From the geometry of the triangle formed by vectors:

- Angle between vA and x-axis: 22.5°
- Angle between vtot and vA: 26.5°
- Angle between vB and vtot: 23.0°

This means:

- vtot is at angle: 22.5° + 26.5° = 49.0° from x-axis
- The angle between vA and vB is: 26.5° + 23.0° = 49.5°
- The third angle in the triangle: 180° - 26.5° - 23.0° = 130.5°

Using the **law of sines**:$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$

**Finding vB:**

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v_B}{\sin(26.5°)} = \frac{v_{tot}}{\sin(130.5°)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v_B = v_{tot} \times \frac{\sin(26.5°)}{\sin(130.5°)} = 6.72 \times \frac{0.446}{0.757} = 6.72 \times 0.589 = 3.96 \ms$$
</div>

**Finding vA:**

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v_A}{\sin(23.0°)} = \frac{v_{tot}}{\sin(130.5°)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v_A = v_{tot} \times \frac{\sin(23.0°)}{\sin(130.5°)} = 6.72 \times \frac{0.391}{0.757} = 6.72 \times 0.517 = 3.47 \ms$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The magnitudes can be verified by checking if these vectors, when added head-to-tail with the given angles, produce the known resultant of 6.72 m/s at 49° from the x-axis. The law of sines is particularly useful for solving vector addition problems when angles and one magnitude are known.

**Answer**

The magnitude of velocity **vA is 3.47 m/s** and the magnitude of velocity **vB is 3.96 m/s**.

Find the components of $$v_{\text{tot}}$$
along the **x**- and **y**-axes in [Figure 23](#Figure23).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the magnitude of vtot = 6.72 m/s and its direction (49° from the x-axis, as determined from the angles in Figure 23) to find the x and y components using trigonometry.

**Solution**

Given:

- $$v\_{tot} = 6.72 \ms$$
- Direction: $$\theta = 22.5° + 26.5° = 49.0°$$ from the +x-axis

**x-component:**

<div class="equation">
$$v_{tot,x} = v_{tot}\cos(\theta) = 6.72\cos(49.0°) = 6.72 \times 0.656 = 4.41 \ms$$
</div>

**y-component:**

<div class="equation">
$$v_{tot,y} = v_{tot}\sin(\theta) = 6.72\sin(49.0°) = 6.72 \times 0.755 = 5.07 \ms$$
</div>

**Verification:**

<div class="equation">
$$v_{tot} = \sqrt{v_{tot,x}^2 + v_{tot,y}^2} = \sqrt{(4.41)^2 + (5.07)^2} = \sqrt{19.4 + 25.7} = \sqrt{45.1} = 6.72 \ms$$✓
</div>

**Discussion**

The components represent the effective velocities in the x and y directions. The y-component (5.07 m/s) is slightly larger than the x-component (4.41 m/s), which makes sense since the angle is 49°—closer to 90° (vertical) than to 0° (horizontal). These components are useful for analyzing motion separately in perpendicular directions.

**Answer**

The components of vtot are: **x-component = 4.41 m/s** and **y-component = 5.07 m/s**.

Find the components of $$v_{\text{tot}}$$
along a set of perpendicular axes rotated $$30^\circ$$ counterclockwise
relative to those in [Figure 23](#Figure23).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When axes are rotated, we need to find components in the new coordinate system. The original vtot makes an angle of 49° with the original x-axis. In the rotated system (30° counterclockwise), the vector makes an angle of 49° - 30° = 19° with the new x'-axis.

**Solution**

Given:

- $$v\_{tot} = 6.72 \ms$$
- Angle with original x-axis: $$\theta = 49.0°$$
- Rotation of axes: $$30°$$ counterclockwise
- Angle with new x'-axis: $$\theta' = 49.0° - 30.0° = 19.0°$$

**Component along new x'-axis:**

<div class="equation">
$$v'_{tot,x'} = v_{tot}\cos(\theta') = 6.72\cos(19.0°) = 6.72 \times 0.946 = 6.35 \ms$$
</div>

**Component along new y'-axis:**

<div class="equation">
$$v'_{tot,y'} = v_{tot}\sin(\theta') = 6.72\sin(19.0°) = 6.72 \times 0.326 = 2.19 \ms$$
</div>

**Alternative method using rotation formulas:**

We could also transform the original components (4.41, 5.07) using rotation matrices:

<div class="equation">
$$v'_{x'} = v_x\cos(30°) + v_y\sin(30°) = 4.41(0.866) + 5.07(0.500) = 3.82 + 2.54 = 6.36 \ms$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v'_{y'} = -v_x\sin(30°) + v_y\cos(30°) = -4.41(0.500) + 5.07(0.866) = -2.21 + 4.39 = 2.18 \ms$$
</div>

Both methods agree (within rounding).

**Discussion**

Rotating the coordinate system doesn't change the vector itself—only how we describe it. The magnitude remains 6.72 m/s. The new x'-component (6.35 m/s) is larger than the old x-component (4.41 m/s) because the new x'-axis is tilted more toward the direction of vtot. Conversely, the new y'-component (2.19 m/s) is smaller than the old y-component (5.07 m/s).

**Answer**

In the rotated coordinate system, the components of vtot are: **x'-component = 6.35 m/s** and **y'-component = 2.19 m/s**.
