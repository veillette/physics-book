* Observe heat transfer and change in temperature and mass.

</div>

One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: heating
increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. We assume that there is no
phase change and that no work is done on or by the system. Experiments show that
the transferred heat depends on three factors—the change in temperature, the
mass of the system, and the substance and phase of the substance.

![Figure a shows a copper-colored cylinder of mass m and temperature change delta T. The heat Q, shown as a wavy rightward horizontal arrow, is transferred to the cylinder from the left. To the right of this image is a similar image, except that the heat transferred Q prime is twice the heat Q. The temperature change of this second cylinder, which is also labeled m, is two delta T. This cylinder is surrounded by small black wavy lines radiating outward. Figure b shows the same two cylinders as in Figure a. The left cylinder is labeled m and delta T and has a wavy heat arrow pointing at it from the left that is labeled Q. The right cylinder is labeled two m and delta T and has a wavy heat arrow pointing to it from the left labeled Q prime equals two Q. Figure c shows the same copper cylinder of mass m and with temperature change delta T, with heat Q being transferred to it. To the right of this cylinder, Q prime equals ten point eight times Q is being transferred to another cylinder filled with water whose mass and change in temperature are the same as that of the copper cylinder.](../resources/Figure_14_02_01.jpg 'The heat ( Q ) transferred to cause a temperature change depends on the magnitude of the temperature change, the mass of the system, and the substance and phase involved. (a) The amount of heat transferred is directly proportional to the temperature change. To double the temperature change of a mass ( m ) , you need to add twice the heat. (b) The amount of heat transferred is also directly proportional to the mass. To cause an equivalent temperature change in a doubled mass, you need to add twice the heat. (c) The amount of heat transferred depends on the substance and its phase. If it takes an amount ( Q ) of heat to cause a temperature change (\\Delta T ) in a given mass of copper, it will take 10.8 times that amount of heat to cause the equivalent temperature change in the same mass of water assuming no phase change in either substance.')
{: #Figure1}

The dependence on temperature change and mass are easily understood. Owing to
the fact that the (average) kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is
proportional to the absolute temperature, the internal energy of a system is
proportional to the absolute temperature and the number of atoms or molecules.
Owing to the fact that the transferred heat is equal to the change in the
internal energy, the heat is proportional to the mass of the substance and the
temperature change. The transferred heat also depends on the substance so that,
for example, the heat necessary to raise the temperature is less for alcohol
than for water. For the same substance, the transferred heat also depends on the
phase (gas, liquid, or solid).

<div class="title">
Heat Transfer and Temperature Change
</div>
The quantitative relationship between heat transfer and temperature change contains all three factors:

<div class="equation" >
 $$Q=mc\Delta T, $$
</div>
where  $$Q $$  is the symbol for heat transfer,  $$m $$
 is the mass of the substance, and  $$\Delta T $$
 is the change in temperature. The symbol  $$c $$
 stands for **specific heat** and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of mass by  $$1.00\text{ºC} $$ .
 The specific heat  $$c $$
 is a property of the substance; its SI unit is  $$\text{J/}\left(\text{kg}\cdot \text{K}\right) $$
 or  $$\text{J/}\left(\text{kg}\cdot ºC\right). $$
 Recall that the temperature change  $$\left(\Delta T\right) $$
 is the same in units of kelvin and degrees Celsius. If heat transfer is measured in kilocalories, then *the unit of specific heat* is  $$\text{kcal/}\left(\text{kg}\cdot ºC\right). $$
</div>

Values of specific heat must generally be looked up in tables, because there is
no simple way to calculate them. In general, the specific heat also depends on
the temperature. [[Table 1]](#Table1) lists representative values of specific
heat for various substances. Except for gases, the temperature and volume
dependence of the specific heat of most substances is weak. We see from this
table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass and ten times
that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the
temperature of water the same amount as for glass and ten times as much heat to
raise the temperature of water as for iron. In fact, water has one of the
largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life
on Earth.

<div class="title">
Calculating the Required Heat: Heating Water in an Aluminum Pan
</div>
A 0.500 kg aluminum pan on a stove is used to heat 0.250 liters of water from  $$20.0 \text{ºC} $$
 to  $$80.0 \text{ºC} $$ .
 (a) How much heat is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water?

**Strategy**

The pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan
on the stove, the temperature of the water and the pan is increased by the same
amount. We use the equation for the heat transfer for the given temperature
change and mass of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water and
aluminum are given in [[Table 1]](#Table1).

**Solution**

Because water is in thermal contact with the aluminum, the pan and the water are
at the same temperature.

1. Calculate the temperature difference:
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\Delta T={T}_{\text{f}}-{T}_{\text{i}}=60.0 \text{ºC.} $$
   </div>

2. Calculate the mass of water. Because the density of water is $$1000 {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ , one liter of water has a mass of 1 kg, and the mass of
   0.250 liters of water is $${m}_{w}= 0.250 \text{kg} $$ .

3. Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water
   in [[Table 1]](#Table1)\:
   <div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{w}={m}_{w}{c}_{w}\Delta T=\left( 0.250 \text{kg}\right)\left(4186 \text{J/kg}\text{ºC}\right)\left(60.0\text{ºC}\right)=62.8 kJ. $$ 
   </div>

4. Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for
   aluminum in [[Table 1]](#Table1)\:
   <div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{\text{Al}}={m}_{\text{Al}}{c}_{\text{Al}}\Delta T=\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right)\left(900 \text{J/kgºC}\right)\left(60.0 \text{ºC}\right)= 27.0 \times 10^{4}\text{J}= 27.0 \text{kJ} . $$ 
   </div>

5. Compare the percentage of heat going into the pan versus that going into the
   water. First, find the total transferred heat:
   <div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{\text{Total}}={Q}_{\text{W}}+{Q}_{\text{Al}}= 62.8 \text{kJ}+ 27.0 \text{kJ} = 89.8 \text{kJ} \text{.} $$ 
   </div>

Thus, the amount of heat going into heating the pan is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ 27.0 \text{kJ}}{ 89.8 \text{kJ}}×100 \% =30.1 \text{\%,}  $$
</div>
and the amount going into heating the water is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ 62.8 \text{kJ}}{ 89.8 \text{kJ}}×100 \% =69.9 \% \text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

In this example, the heat transferred to the container is a significant fraction
of the total transferred heat. Although the mass of the pan is twice that of the
water, the specific heat of water is over four times greater than that of
aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice the heat to achieve the
given temperature change for the water as compared to the aluminum pan.

<div class="title">
Calculating the Temperature Increase from the Work Done on a Substance: Truck Brakes Overheat on Downhill Runs
</div>
Truck brakes used to control speed on a downhill run do work, converting gravitational potential energy into increased internal energy (higher temperature) of the brake material. This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck. The problem is that the mass of the truck is large compared with that of the brake material absorbing the energy, and the temperature increase may occur too fast for sufficient heat to transfer from the brakes to the environment.

Calculate the temperature increase of 100 kg of brake material with an average
specific heat of $$800 \text{J/kg}\cdot \text{ºC} $$ if the material retains 10%
of the energy from a 10 000-kg truck descending 75.0 m (in vertical
displacement) at a constant speed.

**Strategy**

If the brakes are not applied, gravitational potential energy is converted into
kinetic energy. When brakes are applied, gravitational potential energy is
converted into internal energy of the brake material. We first calculate the
gravitational potential energy $$\left(\text{Mgh}\right) $$ that the entire
truck loses in its descent and then find the temperature increase produced in
the brake material alone.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes
   downhill
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Mgh}=\left(10 000 \text{kg}\right)\left(9.80 \text{m}{\text{/s}}^{2}\right)\left(75.0 \text{m}\right)=7.35 \times 10^{6} \text{J} \text{.} $$ 
   </div>

2. Calculate the temperature from the heat transferred using $$Q=0.1\text{Mgh} $$
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\Delta T=\frac{Q}{mc}\text{,} $$
   </div>
   where $$m $$
   is the mass of the brake material. Since only 10% of the gravitational potential energy is retained as heat, $$Q = 0.1 \times 7.35 \times 10^{6} \text{J} = 7.35 \times 10^{5} \text{J} $$.

   Insert the values $$m=100 \text{kg} $$
   and $$c=800 \text{J/kg}\cdot \text{ºC} $$ to find
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta T=\frac{\left( 7.35 \times 10^{5} \text{J}\right)}{\left(100 \text{kg}\right)\left(800 \text{J/kgºC}\right)}=9.2 \text{ºC.} $$ 
   </div>

**Discussion**

This same idea underlies the recent hybrid technology of cars, where mechanical
energy (gravitational potential energy) is converted by the brakes into
electrical energy (battery).

<div class="title">
Calculating the Final Temperature When Heat Is Transferred Between Two Bodies: Pouring Cold Water in a Hot Pan
</div>
Suppose you pour 0.250 kg of  $$20.0\text{ºC} $$
 water (about a cup) into a 0.500-kg aluminum pan off the stove with a temperature of  $$150 \text{ºC} $$ .
 Assume that the pan is placed on an insulated pad and that a negligible amount of water boils off. What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium a short time later?

**Strategy**

The pan is placed on an insulated pad so that little heat transfer occurs with
the surroundings. Originally the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium:
the pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat transfer then restores
thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact. Because heat transfer
between the pan and water takes place rapidly, the mass of evaporated water is
negligible and the magnitude of the heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat
gained by the water. The exchange of heat stops once a thermal equilibrium
between the pan and the water is achieved. The heat exchange can be written as
$$\mid {Q}_{\text{hot}}\mid ={Q}_{\text{cold}} $$.

**Solution**

1. Use the equation for heat transfer $$Q=mc\Delta T $$  
   to express the heat lost by the aluminum pan in terms of the mass of the pan,
   the specific heat of aluminum, the initial temperature of the pan, and the
   final temperature:
   <div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{\text{hot}}={m}_{\text{Al}}{c}_{\text{Al}}\left({T}_{\text{f}}-150 \text{ºC}\right)\text{.} $$ 
   </div>

2. Express the heat gained by the water in terms of the mass of the water, the
   specific heat of water, the initial temperature of the water and the final
   temperature:
   <div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{\text{cold}}={m}_{W}{c}_{W}\left({T}_{\text{f}}-20.0 \text{ºC}\right) \text{.} $$ 
   </div>

3. Note that $${Q}_{\text{hot}}<0 $$  
   and $${Q}_{\text{cold}}>0 $$  
   and that they must sum to zero because the heat lost by the hot pan must be
   the same as the heat gained by the cold water:
   <div class="equation" >
$$\begin{array}{lll}\hfill {Q}_{\text{cold}}+{Q}_{\text{hot}}& =& 0
   \text{,}\\ \hfill {Q}_{\text{cold}}& =& {-\text{Q}}_{\text{hot}},\\ {m}_{W}{c}_{W}\left({T}_{\text{f}}-20.0 \text{ºC}\right)& =& -m_{\text{Al}}{c}_{\text{Al}}\left({T}_{\text{f}}-150 \text{ºC.}\right)\end{array} $$
   </div>

4. This an equation for the unknown final temperature, $${T}_{\text{f}} $$
5. Bring all terms involving $${T}_{\text{f}} $$     
   on the left-hand side and all other terms on the right-hand side. Solve for
   $${T}\_{\text{f}} $$ ,
   <div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{f}}=\frac{ {m}_{\text{Al}}{c}_{\text{Al}}\left(150 \text{ºC}\right)+{m}_{W}{c}_{W}\left(20.0\text{ºC}\right)}{ {m}_{\text{Al}}{c}_{\text{Al}}+{m}_{W}{c}_{W}}\text{,} $$ 
   </div>

   and insert the numerical values:

    <div class="equation" >
     $$\begin{array}{lll}{T}_{\text{f}}& =& \frac{\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right)\left(900 \text{J/kgºC}\right)\left(150 \text{ºC}\right)+\left(0.250 \text{kg}\right)\left(4186 \text{J/kgºC}\right)\left(20.0 \text{ºC}\right)}{\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right)\left(900 \text{J/kgºC}\right)+\left(0.250 \text{kg}\right)\left(4186 \text{J/kgºC}\right)}\\ & =& \frac{88430 \text{J}}{1496.5 \text{J/ºC}}\\ & =& 59.1\text{ºC.}\end{array} $$
    </div>

**Discussion**

This is a typical _calorimetry_ problem—two bodies at different temperatures are
brought in contact with each other and exchange heat until a common temperature
is reached. Why is the final temperature so much closer to $$20.0 \text{ºC} $$
than $$150 \text{ºC} $$ ? The reason is that water has a greater specific heat
than most common substances and thus undergoes a small temperature change for a
given heat transfer. A large body of water, such as a lake, requires a large
amount of heat to increase its temperature appreciably. This explains why the
temperature of a lake stays relatively constant during a day even when the
temperature change of the air is large. However, the water temperature does
change over longer times (e.g., summer to winter).

Take-Home Experiment: Temperature Change of Land and Water

What heats faster, land or water?

To study differences in heat capacity:

- Place equal masses of dry sand (or soil) and water at the same temperature
  into two small jars. (The average density of soil or sand is about 1.6 times
  that of water, so you can achieve approximately equal masses by using $$50 \% $$ more water by volume.)
- Heat both (using an oven or a heat lamp) for the same amount of time.
- Record the final temperature of the two masses.
- Now bring both jars to the same temperature by heating for a longer period of

- Remove the jars from the heat source and measure their temperature every 5
  minutes for about 30 minutes.

### Summary

- The transfer of heat $$Q $$ that leads to a change $$\Delta T $$ in the
  temperature of a body with mass $$m $$ is $$Q=mc\Delta T $$ , where $$c $$ is
  the specific heat of the material. This relationship can also be considered as
  the definition of specific heat.

$$1 \frac{\text{cal}}{\text{g}\cdot\text{ºC}} = \frac{1000}{1000} \frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{ºC}} = 1 \frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{ºC}}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This demonstrates that the two units are indeed equivalent. This is why the specific heat of water can be expressed as either 1.00 cal/g·ºC or 1.00 kcal/kg·ºC. When we increase the mass unit by a factor of 1000 (g to kg), we must also increase the energy unit by the same factor (cal to kcal) to maintain the same value for specific heat.

**Answer**

The two units are equivalent: $$1 \text{ cal/g}\cdot \text{ºC} = 1 \text{ kcal/kg}\cdot \text{ºC}$$.

To sterilize a 50.0-g glass baby bottle, we must raise its temperature from  $$ 22.0\text{ºC} $$
 to  $$ 95.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 How much heat transfer is required?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the equation $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ to calculate the heat transfer required. We need the mass of the glass bottle, the temperature change, and the specific heat of glass from Table 1.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$m = 50.0 \text{ g} = 0.0500 \text{ kg}$$
- Initial temperature: $$T_i = 22.0\text{ºC}$$
- Final temperature: $$T_f = 95.0\text{ºC}$$
- Specific heat of glass: $$c = 840 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (from Table 1)

Calculate the temperature change:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = T_f - T_i = 95.0\text{ºC} - 22.0\text{ºC} = 73.0\text{ºC}$$

</div>

<div class="equation">
$$Q = 3066 \text{ J} = 3.07 \times 10^3 \text{ J} = 3.07 \text{ kJ}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The heat required (3.07 kJ) is relatively small because the mass of the glass bottle is small (only 50 g). This amount of energy is comparable to what a 100-watt light bulb produces in about 30 seconds. Sterilization requires heating to at least 80-100°C to kill bacteria and viruses, and the modest energy requirement makes it practical to sterilize baby bottles frequently.

Glass is chosen for baby bottles (though plastic is now more common) partly because it can withstand repeated heating without degrading. The specific heat of glass (840 J/kg·ºC) is similar to concrete but much lower than water, meaning glass heats up relatively quickly when placed in boiling water or a sterilizer.

In practice, when sterilizing in boiling water, you must also heat the water or contents inside the bottle, which would require significantly more energy due to water's much higher specific heat.

**Answer**

The heat transfer required to sterilize the glass baby bottle is **3.07 kJ** or **3.07 × 10³ J**.

Given: $$Q = 1.00 \text{ kcal} = 4186 \text{ J}$$, $$m = 1.00 \text{ kg}$$, $$T_i = 20.0\text{ºC}$$

Rearranging $$Q = mc\Delta T$$:

**Discussion**

The results clearly show that substances with lower specific heats experience larger temperature changes for the same heat transfer. Water, with its very high specific heat, changes temperature the least (only 1.00°C), while mercury, with a much lower specific heat, experiences the largest temperature change (30.1°C). This is why water is an excellent thermal regulator and is used in cooling systems—it can absorb large amounts of heat with minimal temperature change. The large specific heat of water is also why coastal regions have more moderate climates than inland areas.

Rubbing your hands together warms them by converting work into thermal energy. If a woman rubs her hands back and forth for a total of 20 rubs, at a distance of 7.50 cm per rub, and with an average frictional force of 40.0 N, what is the temperature increase? The mass of tissues warmed is only 0.100 kg, mostly in the palms and fingers.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem illustrates the mechanical equivalent of heat. The work done by friction is converted into thermal energy, which raises the temperature of the hand tissues. We first calculate the total work done using $$W = Fd$$, then equate this to the heat absorbed: $$Q = W = mc\Delta T$$, and solve for the temperature increase.

**Solution**

Given:
- Number of rubs: $$N = 20$$
- Distance per rub: $$d = 7.50 \text{ cm} = 0.0750 \text{ m}$$
- Frictional force: $$F = 40.0 \text{ N}$$
- Mass of tissue: $$m = 0.100 \text{ kg}$$
- Specific heat of human tissue: $$c = 3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (from Table 1)

Calculate total distance:
<div class="equation">
$$d_{total} = N \times d = 20 \times 0.0750 \text{ m} = 1.50 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate work done by friction:
<div class="equation">
$$W = Fd_{total} = (40.0 \text{ N})(1.50 \text{ m}) = 60.0 \text{ J}$$
</div>

This work is converted to heat:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = W = 60.0 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Using $$Q = mc\Delta T$$, solve for temperature increase:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc} = \frac{60.0 \text{ J}}{(0.100 \text{ kg})(3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{60.0}{350} = 0.171\text{ºC}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The temperature increase of 0.171°C may seem small, but it's readily perceptible. Human skin is quite sensitive to temperature changes as small as 0.1°C, so you can definitely feel your hands getting warmer when rubbing them together.

This example demonstrates the mechanical equivalent of heat—mechanical work is converted directly into thermal energy. The relatively small temperature increase occurs because human tissue has a high specific heat (3500 J/kg·ºC), nearly as high as water. This high specific heat is beneficial for temperature regulation in the body.

If you wanted to increase the warming effect, you could:
1. Rub more times (increase N)
2. Rub faster and with more pressure (increase F)
3. Use longer strokes (increase d)

This principle is used for survival: rubbing hands together or doing physical exercise generates heat through friction and muscle work, helping maintain body temperature in cold conditions.

**Answer**

The temperature increase from rubbing hands together is **0.171°C**.

We use the equation $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ and solve for the specific heat $$c$$. Then we compare the calculated value to the specific heats in Table 1 to identify the substance.

Given:
- $$m = 0.250 \text{ kg}$$
- $$T_i = 20.0\text{ºC}$$, $$T_f = 65.0\text{ºC}$$

Comparing to Table 1, we find that copper has a specific heat of 387 J/kg·ºC.

**Discussion**

The calculated specific heat of 387 J/kg·ºC matches exactly with the specific heat of copper listed in Table 1. This is a reasonable result because copper is a common material used for blocks in calorimetry experiments due to its good thermal properties and availability. The relatively low specific heat of copper (compared to water) means that it doesn't take much energy to change its temperature significantly, which is characteristic of metals.

The specific heat is $$c = 387 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$, and the substance is most likely **copper**.

Suppose identical amounts of heat transfer into different masses of copper and water, causing identical changes in temperature. What is the ratio of the mass of copper to water?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the equation $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ for both copper and water. Since the heat transfer $$Q$$ and temperature change $$\Delta T$$ are identical for both substances, we can set the two equations equal and solve for the mass ratio.

**Solution**

For water:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = m_w c_w \Delta T$$
</div>

For copper:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = m_{Cu} c_{Cu} \Delta T$$
</div>

Since both heat transfers and temperature changes are equal:
<div class="equation">
$$m_w c_w \Delta T = m_{Cu} c_{Cu} \Delta T$$
</div>

The $$\Delta T$$ cancels:
<div class="equation">
$$m_w c_w = m_{Cu} c_{Cu}$$
</div>

Solving for the mass ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{m_{Cu}}{m_w} = \frac{c_w}{c_{Cu}}$$
</div>

From Table 1:
- Specific heat of water: $$c_w = 4186 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Specific heat of copper: $$c_{Cu} = 387 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{m_{Cu}}{m_w} = \frac{4186}{387} = 10.8$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The mass ratio of 10.8:1 means you need **10.8 kg of copper** to absorb the same amount of heat as **1 kg of water** for the same temperature change. This dramatically illustrates why water has such exceptional thermal properties.

This huge difference arises because water has one of the highest specific heats of any common substance (4186 J/kg·ºC), while copper, like most metals, has a much lower specific heat (387 J/kg·ºC). Water's high specific heat makes it excellent for:

1. **Cooling systems** - Car radiators and industrial cooling use water because it can absorb large amounts of heat with minimal temperature rise
2. **Climate moderation** - Oceans and lakes moderate coastal and regional climates because water temperature changes slowly
3. **Thermal energy storage** - Solar hot water systems and heating systems use water to store thermal energy efficiently
4. **Cooking** - Water in food prevents it from overheating quickly

Conversely, metals like copper heat up and cool down quickly, making them ideal for cooking utensils where rapid heat transfer is desired.

**Answer**

The ratio of the mass of copper to water is **10.8:1** or simply **10.8**.

**Strategy**

The energy released by burning the peanut equals the heat absorbed by both the water and the aluminum cup. We calculate the heat absorbed using $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ for both, then divide by the mass of the peanut to get energy per gram.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass of peanut: $$m_p = 5.00 \text{ g}$$
- Mass of water: $$m_w = 0.500 \text{ kg} = 500 \text{ g}$$
- Mass of aluminum cup: $$m_{Al} = 0.100 \text{ kg} = 100 \text{ g}$$
- Temperature increase: $$\Delta T = 54.9\text{ºC}$$
- Specific heat of water: $$c_w = 1.00 \text{ kcal/kg}\cdot\text{ºC} = 1.00 \text{ cal/g}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Specific heat of aluminum: $$c_{Al} = 0.215 \text{ kcal/kg}\cdot\text{ºC} = 0.215 \text{ cal/g}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

**(a)** Calculate heat absorbed by water:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_w = m_w c_w \Delta T = (500 \text{ g})(1.00 \text{ cal/g}\cdot\text{ºC})(54.9\text{ºC}) = 27450 \text{ cal}$$
</div>

Calculate heat absorbed by aluminum cup:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{Al} = m_{Al} c_{Al} \Delta T = (100 \text{ g})(0.215 \text{ cal/g}\cdot\text{ºC})(54.9\text{ºC}) = 1180 \text{ cal}$$
</div>

Total heat released by peanut:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{total} = Q_w + Q_{Al} = 27450 + 1180 = 28630 \text{ cal} = 28.6 \text{ kcal}$$
</div>

Energy per gram of peanut:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{total}}{m_p} = \frac{28.6 \text{ kcal}}{5.00 \text{ g}} = 5.72 \text{ kcal/g}$$
</div>

**(b)** Typical nutritional labels for peanuts show approximately 5.5-6.0 kcal/g (or about 160-170 Calories per ounce, where 1 Calorie = 1 kcal). Our calculated value of 5.72 kcal/g is consistent with this range.

**Discussion**

The calculated energy content of 5.72 kcal/g is very reasonable for peanuts. Peanuts are high in fat and protein, making them energy-dense foods. The fact that we must heat both the water and the aluminum cup is important—if we had neglected the cup, we would have underestimated the energy content of the peanut by about 4%. This demonstrates why precise calorimetry requires accounting for all objects that absorb heat in the system.

The consistency with nutritional labeling validates both our calculation and the bomb calorimetry techniques used to determine food energy content. These techniques are fundamental to nutrition science and food labeling requirements.

**Answer**

(a) The peanut contains **5.72 kcal/g** of energy.
(b) This value is consistent with typical peanut labeling (5.5-6.0 kcal/g), confirming our calculation.

Following vigorous exercise, the body temperature of an 80.0-kg person is  $$ 40.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 At what rate in watts must the person transfer thermal energy to reduce the body temperature to  $$ 37.0\text{ºC} $$

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to calculate how much heat must be removed to cool the body from 40.0°C to 37.0°C, then determine the rate at which this heat must be transferred. However, the body continues producing heat at 150 W during the cooling period, so the total rate of heat transfer out must account for both cooling AND removing the continuously produced heat.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$m = 80.0 \text{ kg}$$
- Initial temperature: $$T_i = 40.0\text{ºC}$$
- Final temperature: $$T_f = 37.0\text{ºC}$$
- Time: $$t = 30.0 \text{ min} = 1800 \text{ s}$$
- Metabolic heat production: $$P_{metabolic} = 150 \text{ W}$$
- Specific heat of human body: $$c = 3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (from Table 1)

**Step 1:** Calculate heat that must be removed to cool the body:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{cool} = mc\Delta T = (80.0 \text{ kg})(3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC})(40.0 - 37.0)\text{ºC}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$Q_{cool} = (80.0)(3500)(3.0) = 840000 \text{ J} = 8.40 \times 10^5 \text{ J}$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate rate needed to remove this heat in 30 minutes:
<div class="equation">
$$P_{cool} = \frac{Q_{cool}}{t} = \frac{8.40 \times 10^5 \text{ J}}{1800 \text{ s}} = 467 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Calculate total heat transfer rate needed:

The body must transfer out both:
- Heat to cool down: 467 W
- Metabolic heat being produced: 150 W

<div class="equation">
$$P_{total} = P_{cool} + P_{metabolic} = 467 + 150 = 617 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The body must transfer heat at a rate of 617 W to cool down in 30 minutes while continuing to produce metabolic heat. This is a substantial rate—about six times the power of a 100-watt light bulb.

The body accomplishes this cooling through multiple mechanisms:
1. **Evaporation of sweat** - Most effective, accounts for ~80% of cooling during exercise
2. **Increased blood flow to skin** - Enhances convection and radiation
3. **Increased respiration** - Evaporates moisture from lungs and airways
4. **Radiation and convection** - Direct heat transfer to cooler surroundings

During vigorous exercise, metabolic rates can reach 1000 W or higher, which is why athletes sweat profusely—evaporative cooling is essential. The cooling rate of 617 W could be achieved by evaporating approximately 0.25 kg (250 mL) of sweat over the 30-minute period, which is quite realistic for post-exercise recovery.

This calculation shows why it's important to cool down gradually after exercise and why hydration is critical—you need water for sweat production to dissipate excess heat safely.

**Answer**

The person must transfer thermal energy at a rate of **617 W** to reduce body temperature from 40.0°C to 37.0°C in 30 minutes while metabolic processes continue.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship between power (rate of heat transfer), mass, specific heat, and rate of temperature change. Starting with $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ and dividing both sides by time $$t$$, we get $$\frac{Q}{t} = mc\frac{\Delta T}{t}$$, where $$\frac{Q}{t}$$ is the power and $$\frac{\Delta T}{t}$$ is the rate of temperature change.

**Solution**

Given:
- Power: $$P = \frac{Q}{t} = 150 \text{ MW} = 150 \times 10^6 \text{ W} = 1.50 \times 10^8 \text{ J/s}$$
- Mass: $$m = 1.60 \times 10^5 \text{ kg}$$
- Specific heat: $$c = 0.3349 \text{ kJ/kg}\cdot\text{ºC} = 334.9 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

**(a)** Solve for the rate of temperature increase:

From $$P = mc\frac{\Delta T}{t}$$:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = \frac{P}{mc} = \frac{1.50 \times 10^8 \text{ J/s}}{(1.60 \times 10^5 \text{ kg})(334.9 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = \frac{1.50 \times 10^8}{5.358 \times 10^7} = 2.80\text{ ºC/s}$$
</div>

**(b)** Time to reach $$\Delta T = 2000\text{ºC}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T/t} = \frac{2000\text{ºC}}{2.80\text{ ºC/s}} = 714 \text{ s}$$
</div>

Converting to minutes:
<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{714 \text{ s}}{60 \text{ s/min}} = 11.9 \text{ min}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The results are alarming. At a rate of 2.80°C per second, the reactor core temperature would rise rapidly without cooling. In less than 12 minutes, the temperature could increase by 2000°C, potentially causing structural metals to melt and leading to a catastrophic failure. This demonstrates why continuous cooling is absolutely critical for nuclear reactors, even after shutdown—the decay of fission products continues to generate enormous amounts of heat.

As noted in the problem, this calculation represents an initial rate. In reality, the temperature rise would initially be even faster in localized hot spots, then would slow as heat spreads to the larger containment vessel. This scenario illustrates the importance of backup cooling systems and the dangers highlighted by accidents like Fukushima (2011), where cooling system failure led to core melting.

The decay heat typically decreases with time following shutdown, dropping to about 1-2% of operational power after a few hours, but this is still substantial and requires active cooling for days or weeks.

**Answer**

(a) The rate of temperature increase is **2.80ºC/s**.
(b) It would take approximately **714 s** or **11.9 minutes** to reach a 2000ºC temperature increase.
