* Describe the basic structure of the atom, the substructure of all matter.
</div>

How do we know that atoms are really there if we cannot see them with our eyes?
A brief account of the progression from the proposal of atoms by the Greeks to
the first direct evidence of their existence follows.

People have long speculated about the structure of matter and the existence of
atoms. The earliest significant ideas to survive are due to the ancient Greeks
in the fifth century BCE, especially those of the philosophers Leucippus and
Democritus. (There is some evidence that philosophers in both India and China
made similar speculations, at about the same time.) They considered the question
of whether a substance can be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces.
There are only a few possible answers to this question. One is that
infinitesimally small subdivision is possible. Another is what Democritus in
particular believed—that there is a smallest unit that cannot be further
subdivided. Democritus called this the **atom**{: class="term"}. We now know
that atoms themselves can be subdivided, but their identity is destroyed in the
process, so the Greeks were correct in a respect. The Greeks also felt that
atoms were in constant motion, another correct notion.

The Greeks and others speculated about the properties of atoms, proposing that
only a few types existed and that all matter was formed as various combinations
of these types. The famous proposal that the basic elements were earth, air,
fire, and water was brilliant, but incorrect. The Greeks had identified the most
common examples of the four states of matter (solid, gas, plasma, and liquid),
rather than the basic elements. More than 2000 years passed before observations
could be made with equipment capable of revealing the true nature of atoms.

Over the centuries, discoveries were made regarding the properties of substances
and their chemical reactions. Certain systematic features were recognized, but
similarities between common and rare elements resulted in efforts to transmute
them (lead into gold, in particular) for financial gain. Secrecy was endemic.
Alchemists discovered and rediscovered many facts but did not make them broadly
available. As the Middle Ages ended, alchemy gradually faded, and the science of
chemistry arose. It was no longer possible, nor considered desirable, to keep
discoveries secret. Collective knowledge grew, and by the beginning of the 19th
century, an important fact was well established—the masses of reactants in
specific chemical reactions always have a particular mass ratio. This is very
strong indirect evidence that there are basic units (atoms and molecules) that
have these same mass ratios. The English chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) did
much of this work, with significant contributions by the Italian physicist
Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). It was Avogadro who developed the idea of a fixed
number of atoms and molecules in a mole, and this special number is called
Avogadro’s number in his honor. The Austrian physicist Johann Josef Loschmidt
was the first to measure the value of the constant in 1865 using the kinetic
theory of gases.

Patterns and Systematics
</div>
The recognition and appreciation of patterns has enabled us to make many discoveries. The periodic table of elements was proposed as an organized summary of the known elements long before all elements had been discovered, and it led to many other discoveries. We shall see in later chapters that patterns in the properties of subatomic particles led to the proposal of quarks as their underlying structure, an idea that is still bearing fruit.

</div>

Knowledge of the properties of elements and compounds grew, culminating in the
mid-19th-century development of the periodic table of the elements by Dmitri
Mendeleev (1834–1907), the great Russian chemist. Mendeleev proposed an
ingenious array that highlighted the periodic nature of the properties of
elements. Believing in the systematics of the periodic table, he also predicted
the existence of then-unknown elements to complete it. Once these elements were
discovered and determined to have properties predicted by Mendeleev, his
periodic table became universally accepted.

Also during the 19th century, the kinetic theory of gases was developed. Kinetic
theory is based on the existence of atoms and molecules in random thermal motion
and provides a microscopic explanation of the gas laws, heat transfer, and
thermodynamics (
see [Introduction to Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws](../contents/ch13TemperatureKineticTheoryAndTheGasLaws)
and [Introduction to Laws of Thermodynamics](../contents/ch15Thermodynamics)). Kinetic
theory works so well that it is another strong indication of the existence of
atoms. But it is still indirect evidence—individual atoms and molecules had not
been observed. There were heated debates about the validity of kinetic theory
until direct evidence of atoms was obtained.

The first truly direct evidence of atoms is credited to Robert Brown, a Scottish
botanist. In 1827, he noticed that tiny pollen grains suspended in still water
moved about in complex paths. This can be observed with a microscope for any
small particles in a fluid. The motion is caused by the random thermal motions
of fluid molecules colliding with particles in the fluid, and it is now
called **Brownian motion**. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) Statistical
fluctuations in the numbers of molecules striking the sides of a visible
particle cause it to move first this way, then that. Although the molecules
cannot be directly observed, their effects on the particle can be. By examining
Brownian motion, the size of molecules can be calculated. The smaller and more
numerous they are, the smaller the fluctuations in the numbers striking
different sides.

![Inside a circle, water molecules are shown with a magnified image of a suspended pollen grain. The suspended particle is being constantly hit by molecules in the surrounding fluid. The path followed by the pollen grain is zig-zagging and complex, illustrating Brownian motion.](../resources/Figure_30_01_01.jpg 'The position of a pollen grain in water, measured every few seconds under a microscope, exhibits Brownian motion. Brownian motion is due to fluctuations in the number of atoms and molecules colliding with a small mass, causing it to move about in complex paths. This is nearly direct evidence for the existence of atoms, providing a satisfactory alternative explanation cannot be found.')
{: #Figure1}

It was Albert Einstein who, starting in his epochal year of 1905, published
several papers that explained precisely how Brownian motion could be used to
measure the size of atoms and molecules. (In 1905 Einstein created special
relativity, proposed photons as quanta of EM radiation, and produced a theory of
Brownian motion that allowed the size of atoms to be determined. All of this was
done in his spare time, since he worked days as a patent examiner. Any one of
these very basic works could have been the crowning achievement of an entire
career—yet Einstein did even more in later years.) Their sizes were only
approximately known to be $$10^{\text{−10}} \text{m} $$ , based on a comparison
of latent heat of vaporization and surface tension made in about 1805 by Thomas
Young of double-slit fame and the famous astronomer and mathematician Simon
Laplace.

Using Einstein’s ideas, the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Perrin (1870–1942)
carefully observed Brownian motion; not only did he confirm Einstein’s theory,
he also produced accurate sizes for atoms and molecules. Since molecular weights
and densities of materials were well established, knowing atomic and molecular
sizes allowed a precise value for Avogadro’s number to be obtained. (If we know
how big an atom is, we know how many fit into a certain volume.) Perrin also
used these ideas to explain atomic and molecular agitation effects in
sedimentation, and he received the 1926 Nobel Prize for his achievements. Most
scientists were already convinced of the existence of atoms, but the accurate
observation and analysis of Brownian motion was conclusive—it was the first
truly direct evidence.

A huge array of direct and indirect evidence for the existence of atoms now
exists. For example, it has become possible to accelerate ions (much as
electrons are accelerated in cathode-ray tubes) and to detect them individually
as well as measure their masses (
see [More Applications of Magnetism](../contents/ch22MoreApplicationsOfMagnetism)
for a discussion of mass spectrometers). Other devices that observe individual
atoms, such as the scanning tunneling electron microscope, will be discussed
elsewhere. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) All of our understanding of the
properties of matter is based on and consistent with the atom. The atom’s
substructures, such as electron shells and the nucleus, are both interesting and
important. The nucleus in turn has a substructure, as do the particles of which
it is composed. These topics, and the question of whether there is a smallest
basic structure to matter, will be explored in later parts of the text.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Using the given charge-to-mass ratios for electrons and protons, and knowing the magnitudes of their charges are equal, what is the ratio of the proton's mass to the electron's? (Note that since the charge-to-mass ratios are given to only three-digit accuracy, your answer may differ from the accepted ratio in the fourth digit.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We know from the chapter that the charge-to-mass ratio for the electron is $$ \frac{q_e}{m_e} = -1.76 \times 10^{11} \text{ C/kg} $$ and for the proton is $$ \frac{q_p}{m_p} = 9.58 \times 10^7 \text{ C/kg} $$ . Since the magnitudes of the charges are equal ( $$ |q_e| = |q_p| = e $$ ), we can use these ratios to find the mass ratio. We'll set up the ratio $$ \frac{m_p}{m_e} $$ and express it in terms of the known charge-to-mass ratios.

**Solution**

Since the magnitudes of the charges are equal, we have $$ |q_e| = |q_p| = e $$ , where $$ e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} $$ .

From the charge-to-mass ratios, we can write:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_e = \frac{|q_e|}{|q_e/m_e|} \text{ and } m_p = \frac{|q_p|}{|q_p/m_p|} $$
</div>

The ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{m_p}{m_e} = \frac{|q_p|/(|q_p/m_p|)}{|q_e|/(|q_e/m_e|)} = \frac{|q_p|}{|q_e|} \cdot \frac{|q_e/m_e|}{|q_p/m_p|} $$
</div>

Since $$ |q_p| = |q_e| $$ , this simplifies to:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{m_p}{m_e} = \frac{|q_e/m_e|}{|q_p/m_p|} = \frac{1.76 \times 10^{11} \text{ C/kg}}{9.58 \times 10^7 \text{ C/kg}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{m_p}{m_e} = 1.84 \times 10^{3} $$
</div>

Therefore, the proton is approximately **1840 times** more massive than the electron.

**Discussion**

This result shows that the proton is nearly 2000 times heavier than the electron, despite both particles having the same magnitude of electric charge. This enormous mass difference has profound implications for atomic structure. It explains why the nucleus, which contains protons (and neutrons, which have similar mass), accounts for essentially all the mass of an atom even though it occupies only a tiny fraction of the atom's volume. The electron, being so much lighter, can be easily accelerated and deflected by electric and magnetic fields, which is why cathode rays (electron beams) were relatively easy to manipulate in Thomson's experiments. The modern accepted value of the proton-to-electron mass ratio is 1836.15, which differs slightly from our result in the fourth digit, as expected given the three-digit accuracy of the charge-to-mass ratios provided. This mass ratio is one of the fundamental constants of nature and plays a crucial role in determining the properties of atoms, molecules, and ultimately all matter in the universe.

(a) Calculate the mass of a proton using the charge-to-mass ratio given for it in this chapter and its known charge. (b) How does your result compare with the proton mass given in this chapter?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From the chapter, we know the charge-to-mass ratio for the proton is $$ \frac{q_p}{m_p} = 9.58 \times 10^7 \text{ C/kg} $$ and the magnitude of the proton's charge is $$ q_p = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} $$ (the same magnitude as the electron's charge). We can rearrange the charge-to-mass ratio to solve for the proton mass: $$ m_p = \frac{q_p}{(q_p/m_p)} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_p = \frac{q_p}{(q_p/m_p)} = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}{9.58 \times 10^7 \text{ C/kg}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

(b) This result is identical to the proton mass given in the chapter ( $$ m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} $$ ) to three significant figures, showing excellent agreement.

**Discussion**

The fact that we can calculate the proton mass from its charge-to-mass ratio and its charge demonstrates the consistency of the experimental measurements. This mass is approximately 1836 times the mass of an electron, which makes sense given that the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron is about 1836 times larger than that of the proton (while both have the same magnitude of charge). The proton's much larger mass compared to the electron is fundamental to understanding atomic structure—it explains why the nucleus, despite being tiny, contains essentially all the mass of an atom. This large mass ratio also justifies Bohr's assumption that the nucleus remains essentially stationary while the electron orbits around it, which simplifies the analysis of atomic structure significantly.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If someone wanted to build a scale model of the atom with a nucleus 1.00 m in diameter, how far away would the nearest electron need to be?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From the chapter and Rutherford's experiments, we know that the nucleus has a diameter of approximately $$ 10^{-15} \text{ m} $$ , while the atom itself has a diameter of approximately $$ 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ (the typical distance to the nearest electron). To find the scale model distance, we need to find the ratio of atomic diameter to nuclear diameter, then multiply this ratio by the model nuclear diameter of 1.00 m.

**Solution**

The ratio of atomic diameter to nuclear diameter is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Scale factor} = \frac{\text{atomic diameter}}{\text{nuclear diameter}} = \frac{10^{-10} \text{ m}}{10^{-15} \text{ m}} = 10^5 $$
</div>

In the scale model, if the nucleus has a diameter of 1.00 m, the nearest electron would be at a distance:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Model distance} = \text{Scale factor} \times \text{model nuclear diameter} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Model distance} = 10^5 \times 1.00 \text{ m} = 100,000 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ km} $$
</div>

However, this calculation assumes the electron is at the edge of the atom. For a more accurate calculation using the Bohr radius (the most probable distance for the electron in hydrogen's ground state), we have:
- Nuclear diameter: $$ \sim 10^{-15} \text{ m} $$
- Bohr radius (atomic size): $$ a_0 \sim 0.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$

The ratio is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{0.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}}{10^{-15} \text{ m}} = 0.5 \times 10^5 = 5 \times 10^4 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Model distance} = 5 \times 10^4 \times 1.00 \text{ m} = 50,000 \text{ m} = 50 \text{ km} $$
</div>

The nearest electron would be approximately **50 km** away.

**Discussion**

This calculation dramatically illustrates how empty atoms actually are. If the nucleus were scaled up to the size of a basketball (1 m diameter), the nearest electron would be 50 kilometers away! This means that atoms are mostly empty space—a fact that was completely unexpected before Rutherford's gold foil experiment. This emptiness explains why most alpha particles in Rutherford's experiment passed straight through the gold foil without deflection: they simply didn't encounter anything substantial. Only the rare alpha particles that happened to pass very close to a nucleus experienced significant deflection. This model also helps us understand why matter can't be compressed much under normal conditions—when you push on an object, you're really dealing with the electromagnetic forces between electron clouds, not actual contact between solid matter. The vast emptiness of atoms also explains why neutrinos (which interact very weakly with matter) can pass through the entire Earth without hitting anything. If atoms were solid throughout, the world would be a very different place: we couldn't see through anything, and all matter would be incredibly dense.
