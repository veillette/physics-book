### What is Power?

_Power_—the word conjures up many images: a professional football player
muscling aside his opponent, a dragster roaring away from the starting line, a
volcano blowing its lava into the atmosphere, or a rocket blasting off, as
in [Figure 1](#Figure1).

![A space shuttle rocket is being launched and is burning propellant.](../resources/Figure_07_07_01.jpg 'This powerful rocket on the Space Shuttle Endeavor did work and consumed energy at a very high rate. (credit: NASA)')
{: #Figure1}

These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent
with the scientific definition of **power** ( $$ P $$ )
as the rate at which work is done.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Power
</div>
Power is the rate at which work is done.

<div class="equation">
 $$ P=\frac{W}{t} $$
</div>
The SI unit for power is the **watt**
( $$ \text{W} $$ ), where 1 watt equals 1 joule/second $$ \left(1 \text{W}=1 $$
\text{J/s}\right).
</div>

Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is
expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example, expends 60 J of energy per second.
Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time.
For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of
work and consumes a large amount of fuel in a short time.

### Calculating Power from Energy

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating the Power to Climb Stairs
</div>
What is the power output for a 60.0-kg woman who runs up a 3.00 m high flight of stairs in 3.50 s, starting from rest but having a final speed of 2.00 m/s? (See [Figure 2](#Figure2).)

![A woman is standing before a set of stairs with her weight shown by a vector w pointing vertically downward, which is equal to m times g. The normal force N acting on the woman is shown by a vector pointing vertically upward, which is equal to negative w. Her velocity at this point is v sub 0 equal to zero. She runs and reaches the top of the stairs at a height h with velocity v sub f. Now she possesses potential energy as well as kinetic energy labeled as K E plus P E sub g.](../resources/Figure_07_07_02.jpg 'When this woman runs upstairs starting from rest, she converts the chemical energy originally from food into kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. Her power output depends on how fast she does this. ')
{: #Figure2}

**Strategy and Concept**

The work going into mechanical energy is $$ W=\KE + \PE $$. At the bottom of the
stairs, we take both $$ \KE $$ and $$ \PE_{g} $$ as initially zero; thus, $$ W=\KE_{f}+\PE_{g}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}+mgh $$, where $$ h $$ is the vertical height of the stairs. Because all
terms are given, we can calculate $$ W $$ and then divide it by time to get
power.

**Solution**

Substituting the expression for $$ W $$ into the definition of power given in
the previous equation, $$ P=W/t $$ yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{ \frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}+mgh }{t}. $$
</div>
Entering known values yields

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
P&=& \frac{0.5\left(60.0 \kg \right){\left(2.00  \ms \right)}^{2}+\left(60.0 \kg \right)\left( 9.80 \mss \right)\left(3.00 \m \right)}{3.50 \s  }\\
P&=& \frac{120  \J +1764  \J }{3.50 \s  }\\
P&=& 538 \text{W} .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The woman does 1764 J of work to move up the stairs compared with only 120 J to
increase her kinetic energy; thus, most of her power output is required for
climbing rather than accelerating.

</div>

It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than
1 **horsepower** $$ \left(1 \text{hp}=746 \text{W}\right) $$ ! People can
generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short periods of time
by rapidly converting available blood sugar and oxygen into work output. (A
horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted, power output
decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen to
metabolize more food—this is known as the _aerobic_ stage of exercise. If the
woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be much less,
although the amount of work done would be the same.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Measure Your Power Rating
</div>
Determine your own power rating by measuring the time it takes you to climb a flight of stairs. We will ignore the gain in kinetic energy, as the above example showed that it was a small portion of the energy gain. Don’t expect that your output will be more than about 0.5 hp.

</div>

### Examples of Power

Examples of power are limited only by the imagination, because there are as many
types as there are forms of work and energy. (
See [Table 1](#Table1) for some examples.) Sunlight reaching Earth’s surface
carries a maximum power of about 1.3 kilowatts per square meter $$ \left( {\text{kW/m} }^{2}\right)$$. A tiny fraction of this is retained by Earth over
the long term. Our consumption rate of fossil fuels is far greater than the rate
at which they are stored, so it is inevitable that they will be depleted. Power
implies that energy is transferred, perhaps changing form. It is never possible
to change one form completely into another without losing some of it as thermal
energy. For example, a 60-W incandescent bulb converts only 5 W of electrical
power to light, with 55 W dissipating into thermal energy. Furthermore, the
typical electric power plant converts only 35 to 40% of its fuel into
electricity. The remainder becomes a huge amount of thermal energy that must be
dispersed as heat transfer, as rapidly as it is created. A coal-fired power
plant may produce 1000 megawatts; 1 megawatt (MW) is $$ 10^{6}\text{W} $$ of
electric power. But the power plant consumes chemical energy at a rate of about
2500 MW, creating heat transfer to the surroundings at a rate of 1500 MW. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).)

![A distant view of a coal-fired power plant with clearly visible cooling towers generating electric power and emitting a large amount of gases.](../resources/Figure_07_07_03.jpg 'Tremendous amounts of electric power are generated by coal-fired power plants such as this one in China, but an even larger amount of power goes into heat transfer to the surroundings. The large cooling towers here are needed to transfer heat as rapidly as it is produced. The transfer of heat is not unique to coal plants but is an unavoidable consequence of generating electric power from any fuel—nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, or the like.

### Power and Energy Consumption

We usually have to pay for the energy we use. It is interesting and easy to
estimate the cost of energy for an electrical appliance if its power consumption
rate and time used are known. The higher the power consumption rate and the
longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance. The power
consumption rate is $$ P=W/t=E/t $$, where $$ E $$ is the energy supplied by the
electricity company. So the energy consumed over a time $$ t $$ is

<div class="equation">
 $$ E=P t .$$
</div>

Electricity bills state the energy used in units of **kilowatt-hours** $$ \left( \text{kW}\cdot h\right), $$ which is the product of power in kilowatts and time
in hours. This unit is convenient because electrical power consumption at the
kilowatt level for hours at a time is typical.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Energy Costs
</div>
What is the cost of running a 0.200-kW computer 6.00 h per day for 30.0 d
if the cost of electricity is $$ 0.120 \$ \text{ per kW}\cdot h $$ ?

**Strategy**

Cost is based on energy consumed; thus, we must find $$ E $$ from $$ E=Pt $$ and
then calculate the cost. Because electrical energy is expressed in $$ \text{kW}\cdot h $$, at the start of a problem such as this it is convenient to
convert the units into $$ \text{kW} $$ and hours.

**Solution**

The energy consumed in $$ \text{kW}\cdot \text{h} $$ is

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
E&=& P t=\left(0.200\text{kW}\right)\left(6.00\text{h/d}\right)\left(30.0\text{d}\right)\\
E&=& 36.0 \text{kW}\cdot \text{h,}
\end{array} $$
</div>
and the cost is simply given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{cost}=\left(36.0 \text{kW}\cdot h\right)\left(\$0.120 \text{ per kW} \cdot h\right)=\$4.32 \text{per month}. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

The cost of using the computer in this example is neither exorbitant nor
negligible. It is clear that the cost is a combination of power and time. When
both are high, such as for an air conditioner in the summer, the cost is high.

</div>

The motivation to save energy has become more compelling with its
ever-increasing price. Armed with the knowledge that energy consumed is the
product of power and time, you can estimate costs for yourself and make the
necessary value judgments about where to save energy. Either power or time must
be reduced. It is most cost-effective to limit the use of high-power devices
that normally operate for long periods of time, such as water heaters and air
conditioners. This would not include relatively high power devices like
toasters, because they are on only a few minutes per day. It would also not
include electric clocks, in spite of their 24-hour-per-day usage, because they
are very low power devices. It is sometimes possible to use devices that have
greater efficiencies—that is, devices that consume less power to accomplish the
same task. One example is the compact fluorescent light bulb, which produces
over four times more light per watt of power consumed than its incandescent
cousin.

Modern civilization depends on energy, but current levels of energy consumption
and production are not sustainable. The likelihood of a link between global
warming and fossil fuel use (with its concomitant production of carbon dioxide),
has made reduction in energy use as well as a shift to non-fossil fuels of the
utmost importance. Even though energy in an isolated system is a conserved
quantity, the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer
to the environment, which is no longer useful for doing work.

### Section Summary

- Power is the rate at which work is done, or in equation form, for the average
  power $$ P $$ for work $$ W $$ done over a time $$ t $$, $$ P=W/t $$.
- The SI unit for power is the watt (W), where $$ 1 \text{W}=1 \text{J/s} $$.
- The power of many devices such as electric motors is also often expressed in
  horsepower ( hp), where $$ 1 \text{hp}=746 \text{W} $$.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The Crab Nebula (see [Figure 4](#Figure4)) pulsar is the remnant of a supernova that occurred in A.D. 1054. Using data from [Table 1](#Table1), calculate the approximate factor by which the power output of this astronomical object has declined since its explosion.

![A supernova explosion.](../resources/Figure_07_07_04.jpg 'Crab Nebula (credit: ESO, via Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure4}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 1, we can find the power outputs of a supernova at peak and the Crab Nebula pulsar today. The factor of decline is the ratio of current power to initial power.

**Solution**

From Table 1:
- Supernova (at peak): $$ P_{\text{initial}} = 5 \times 10^{37}\text{ W} $$
- Crab Nebula pulsar: $$ P_{\text{current}} = 10^{28}\text{ W} $$

The factor by which power has declined:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Factor} = \frac{P_{\text{current}}}{P_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{10^{28}\text{ W}}{5 \times 10^{37}\text{ W}} = 2 \times 10^{-10} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The power output has declined by a factor of $$ 2 \times 10^{-10} $$, which means the Crab Nebula pulsar now emits only about 0.00000002% of its original supernova power. This enormous decline over approximately 1000 years demonstrates the dramatic energy loss that occurs after a supernova explosion. Despite this massive reduction, the pulsar still outputs $$ 10^{28} $$ W, which is about 25 times greater than the Sun's current power output of $$ 4 \times 10^{26} $$ W. This illustrates both the incredible initial energy released during supernovas and the gradual but inevitable energy dissipation as pulsars spin down over time. The pulsar's rotation slows as it emits electromagnetic radiation and particles, converting its rotational kinetic energy into other forms of energy.

**Answer**

The power output of the Crab Nebula pulsar has declined by a factor of approximately $$ 2 \times 10^{-10} $$ since the supernova explosion in A.D. 1054.

(a) By what factor does its power output increase?
(b) How many times brighter than our entire Milky Way galaxy is the supernova?
(c) Based on your answers, discuss whether it should be possible to observe supernovas in distant galaxies. Note that there are on the order of $$ 10^{11} $$
observable galaxies, the average brightness of which is somewhat less than our
own galaxy.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 1: Sun's power = $$ 4 \times 10^{26}\text{W} $$, Supernova (at peak) = $$ 5 \times 10^{37}\text{W} $$, Milky Way galaxy = $$ 10^{37}\text{W} $$.

**Solution for (a)**

The star's initial power is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P_{\text{star}} = 1000 \times 4 \times 10^{26}\text{W} = 4 \times 10^{29}\text{W} $$
</div>

The power increase factor is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{P_{\text{supernova}}}{P_{\text{star}}} = \frac{5 \times 10^{37}\text{W}}{4 \times 10^{29}\text{W}} = 1.25 \times 10^{8} \approx 10^{8} $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

The ratio of supernova power to galaxy power:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{P_{\text{supernova}}}{P_{\text{galaxy}}} = \frac{5 \times 10^{37}\text{ W}}{10^{37}\text{ W}} = 5 $$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

Based on the calculations above, we can analyze the observability of supernovas. Since a supernova at peak can be 5 times brighter than an entire galaxy containing billions of stars, and considering there are approximately $$ 10^{11} $$ observable galaxies, supernovas should be readily detectable in distant galaxies. A supernova that outshines its host galaxy by a factor of 5 would stand out dramatically against the background, even at great distances.

**Discussion**

Part (a) shows that the supernova increases in brightness by a factor of about $$ 10^{8} $$ (100 million times). This enormous increase in power output occurs in a matter of hours to days, making supernovas among the most dramatic events in the universe.

Part (b) demonstrates that at peak, the supernova is 5 times brighter than the entire Milky Way galaxy. This is remarkable considering a galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars. This result explains why supernovas were historically called "new stars"—they could suddenly appear in the sky where nothing visible existed before.

Part (c): Since a single supernova can outshine an entire galaxy, it should definitely be possible to observe supernovas in distant galaxies, even those billions of light-years away. In fact, astronomers routinely observe and catalog supernovas in remote galaxies. Type Ia supernovas, which have consistent peak luminosities, serve as "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances and were instrumental in the 1998 discovery that the universe's expansion is accelerating—a finding that led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.

**Answer**

(a) The star's power output increases by a factor of approximately $$ 1.25 \times 10^{8} $$ when it goes supernova.
(b) The supernova is 5 times brighter than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
(c) Yes, supernovas should be observable in distant galaxies because they can outshine their entire host galaxy.

A person in good physical condition can put out 100 W of useful power for several hours at a stretch, perhaps by pedaling a mechanism that drives an electric generator. Neglecting any problems of generator efficiency and practical considerations such as resting time:
(a) How many people would it take to run a 4.00-kW electric clothes dryer?
(b) How many people would it take to replace a large electric power plant that generates 800 MW?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Divide the required power by the power output per person to find the number of people needed.

**Solution**

**(a)** For the 4.00-kW clothes dryer:

<div class="equation">
$$ N = \frac{4.00\text{ kW}}{0.100\text{ kW/person}} = \frac{4000\text{ W}}{100\text{ W/person}} = 40\text{ people} $$
</div>

**(b)** For the 800-MW power plant:

<div class="equation">
$$ N = \frac{800\text{ MW}}{100\text{ W/person}} = \frac{8 \times 10^{8}\text{ W}}{100\text{ W/person}} = 8 \times 10^{6}\text{ people} = 8\text{ million people} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a) shows that 40 people would be needed to continuously pedal to run a single 4.00-kW clothes dryer. This seems reasonable when we consider that a person producing 100 W of sustained power is working fairly hard—about the level of moderate cycling. Forty such people working together could indeed power a clothes dryer, though it would be highly impractical.

Part (b) reveals the enormous scale of modern power generation. Eight million people would be needed to replace an 800-MW power plant—roughly the population of New York City. This calculation dramatically illustrates why human power is completely impractical for meeting modern society's energy demands. Even for smaller countries, the entire working-age population would need to pedal continuously just to replace a handful of power plants. This comparison helps explain why the Industrial Revolution, which introduced mechanical power sources far exceeding human capabilities, so dramatically transformed human society. It also underscores the enormous energy consumption of modern civilization and the challenge of transitioning to sustainable energy sources.

**Answer**

(a) It would take 40 people to run a 4.00-kW clothes dryer.
(b) It would take 8 million people to replace an 800-MW power plant.

What is the cost of operating a 3.00-W electric clock for a
year if the cost of electricity is $$ 0.0900 \$ \text{per kW}\cdot h $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy consumed is $$ E = Pt $$, where $$ P = 3.00\text{W} = 0.00300\text{kW} $$ and $$ t = 1\text{ year} = 365 \times 24\text{ h} = 8760\text{ h} $$. The cost is then energy times the rate.

**Solution**

Energy consumed in one year:

<div class="equation">
 $$ E = Pt = (0.00300\text{kW})(8760\text{ h}) = 26.3\text{ kW}\cdot\text{h} $$
</div>

Cost:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Cost} = (26.3\text{ kW}\cdot\text{h})(\$0.0900\text{ per kW}\cdot\text{h}) = \$2.37 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The annual cost of operating a 3.00-W electric clock is approximately $2.37, which is quite economical. This low cost makes sense because although the clock runs continuously (24 hours per day, 365 days per year), its power consumption is very small—only 3 watts. This problem illustrates an important principle in energy conservation: the total energy cost depends on both power and time. While devices like clocks run constantly, their extremely low power consumption means they contribute very little to electricity bills. In contrast, high-power devices like air conditioners (which may use 15,000 W or more) can cost over $100 per month even when used only a few hours daily. This is why energy conservation efforts should focus on limiting high-power devices rather than worrying about low-power devices that run continuously.

**Discussion**

Operating a large 15.0-kW air conditioner for 3 hours per day for 30 days costs approximately $149. This substantial cost explains why electricity bills spike dramatically during summer months when air conditioning is heavily used. The high cost results from the combination of high power consumption (15,000 W is equivalent to running 250 sixty-watt light bulbs simultaneously) and extended usage time. Even though the air conditioner runs only 3 hours per day (12.5% of the time), the cost is significant because of its high power rating. This calculation demonstrates why air conditioners are often the largest contributor to residential electricity costs in warm climates. It also highlights why improving air conditioner efficiency (for example, by using higher SEER ratings) and reducing usage (through better insulation, programmable thermostats, or raising temperature settings by a few degrees) can lead to substantial cost savings. A 20% reduction in air conditioner usage could save about $30 per month in this example.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">

<div class="equation">
 $$ E_{\text{year}} = (1825\text{ kW}\cdot\text{h})(3.6 \times 10^{6}\text{ J/kW}\cdot\text{h}) = 6.57 \times 10^{9}\J $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The average power consumption of 208 W is reasonable for a mid-sized appliance such as a refrigerator, dehumidifier, or home entertainment system. This calculation shows how to convert energy consumption expressed in kW·h per day (common on energy labels) into average power in watts. The 208-W average means the appliance draws this amount continuously when averaged over 24 hours, though actual instantaneous power may vary (for example, a refrigerator compressor cycles on and off).

Part (b): The appliance consumes approximately $$ 6.6 \times 10^{9} $$ J (6.6 gigajoules) of energy annually. This large number in joules illustrates why electrical energy is more conveniently expressed in kilowatt-hours rather than joules for everyday applications. The conversion factor is 1 kW·h = 3.6 × 10⁶ J, so we can verify: 1825 kW·h × 3.6 × 10⁶ J/(kW·h) ≈ 6.6 × 10⁹ J. At a typical electricity rate of \$0.10 per kW·h, this appliance would cost about \$183 per year to operate, representing a significant ongoing expense.

**Answer**

(a) The average power consumption is 208 W.
(b) The appliance consumes approximately $$ 6.57 \times 10^{9} $$ J of energy per year.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), use $$ P = W/t $$ to find power. For part (b), calculate the work needed to lift the bricks and use $$ t = W/P $$.

**Solution**

**(a)** Calculate the average power output:

<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{6.00 \times 10^{6}\J}{8.00\text{ h}} = \frac{6.00 \times 10^{6}\J}{8.00 \times 3600\s} = \frac{6.00 \times 10^{6}\J}{28800\s} = 208\text{ W} $$

</div>

Calculate the time required:

<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{W}{P} = \frac{29400\J}{208\text{ W}} = 141\s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The average useful power output of 208 W (approximately 0.28 hp) is reasonable for sustained physical labor over an 8-hour workday. This is consistent with the estimate used in Problem 3 that a person can sustain about 100 W for extended periods. A construction worker or laborer performing useful work at 208 W is working at a moderate to vigorous level, which would require rest breaks and proper nutrition to maintain throughout a full work shift. The total useful work of $$ 6.00 \times 10^{6} $$ J (6.00 MJ) over 8 hours represents significant physical effort.

Part (b): Lifting 2000 kg of bricks 1.50 m requires 29,400 J of work and takes 141 s (about 2.4 minutes) at the sustained power level of 208 W. This seems reasonable—a worker could lift this mass of bricks in small batches over this time period. For example, lifting 20 kg per trip would require 100 trips, or about one trip every 1.4 seconds, which is physically feasible but demanding. This calculation demonstrates how knowing the power output allows us to predict the time required for specific tasks, which is valuable for project planning and estimating labor requirements.

**Answer**

(a) The average useful power output is 208 W.
(b) It will take 141 s (approximately 2.4 minutes) to lift the bricks.

A 500-kg dragster accelerates from rest to a final speed of 110 m/s in 400 m (about a quarter of a mile) and encounters an average frictional force of 1200 N. What is its average power output in watts and horsepower if this takes 7.30 s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The total work done by the dragster equals the change in kinetic energy plus the work done against friction. Power is the total work divided by time.

**Solution**

The change in kinetic energy is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}(500\kg)(110\ms)^{2} = 3.03 \times 10^{6}\J $$
</div>

The work done against friction is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{f} = fd = (1200\N)(400\m) = 4.80 \times 10^{5}\J $$
</div>

The total work done by the dragster is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{total}} = \Delta \KE + W_{f} = 3.03 \times 10^{6}\J + 4.80 \times 10^{5}\J = 3.51 \times 10^{6}\J $$
</div>

The average power output is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{3.51 \times 10^{6}\J}{7.30\s} = 4.81 \times 10^{5}\text{ W} = 481\text{ kW} $$
</div>

Converting to horsepower:

<div class="equation">
 $$ P = \frac{4.81 \times 10^{5}\text{ W}}{746\text{ W/hp}} = 645\text{ hp} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The dragster's average power output of 481 kW (645 hp) is reasonable for a high-performance racing vehicle, though it's worth noting this is the average power over the acceleration period. Top fuel dragsters can actually produce peak powers exceeding 10,000 hp (7.5 MW), but this calculation gives us the average sustained power needed to achieve the stated performance.

The total work done by the dragster is 3.51 MJ, with about 86% going into kinetic energy and 14% overcoming friction. This shows that even with the significant frictional force of 1200 N over 400 m, the dominant energy requirement is still accelerating the dragster's mass to 110 m/s (nearly 250 mph).

The power output of 645 hp is actually modest by drag racing standards, suggesting this might be a lower-class dragster rather than a top fuel dragster. Professional top fuel dragsters can accelerate even faster (covering a quarter mile in under 4 seconds at over 330 mph), requiring the much higher peak powers mentioned above. This problem illustrates how power requirements scale with both the desired speed and the time available to reach it—faster acceleration times demand proportionally greater power.

**Answer**

The average power output is approximately $$ 4.81 \times 10^{5} $$ W (481 kW) or 645 hp.

**Strategy**

Use the work-energy theorem: the work done by the engine equals the change in kinetic energy (plus change in potential energy for part b). Then use $$ t = W/P $$.

**(a)** Neglecting friction, the work needed is just the kinetic energy gained:

<div class="equation">
$$ W = \Delta \KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}(850\kg)(15.0\ms)^{2} = 95600\J $$

<div class="equation">
$$ W = \Delta \KE + \Delta \PE = 95600\J + mgh = 95600\J + (850\kg)(9.80\mss)(3.00\m) $$

$$ t = \frac{W}{P} = \frac{120590\J}{29840\text{ W}} = 4.04\s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): On level ground, the 850-kg car with a 40.0-hp (29,840-W) engine reaches 15.0 m/s in 3.20 s. This acceleration time seems reasonable for a car with moderate power. For comparison, 40 hp is relatively modest by modern standards (typical cars have 100-200 hp), so a 3.2-second acceleration to 15 m/s (about 34 mph or 54 km/h) represents moderate performance.

Part (b): When climbing a 3.00-m hill while accelerating, the time increases to 4.04 s, which is about 26% longer than on level ground. This increase makes physical sense: the engine must now do additional work against gravity (24,990 J for the potential energy gain) on top of the kinetic energy work (95,600 J). The ratio of total work is 120,590 J / 95,600 J ≈ 1.26, which directly translates to the 26% time increase when power is constant.

This problem illustrates an important practical consideration: vehicles need extra power when climbing hills, which is why cars often downshift (increasing engine RPM and power output) when ascending steep grades. The calculation also shows that at highway speeds, the power needed to climb grades becomes substantial—one reason why fuel economy decreases significantly in mountainous terrain. The additional 25 kJ of potential energy gained might seem modest, but when sustained over long climbs, it represents significant energy consumption.

**Answer**

(a) The time to reach 15.0 m/s on level ground is 3.20 s.
(b) The time to reach 15.0 m/s while climbing a 3.00-m hill is 4.04 s.

**Strategy**

The work done includes raising 2500 kg to height 35.0 m and accelerating the full 10,000 kg mass to 4.00 m/s. Power is total work divided by time.

Work to raise the load:

<div class="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{PE}} = mgh = (2500\kg)(9.80\mss)(35.0\m) = 8.58 \times 10^{5}\J $$

</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The elevator motor's useful power output is 78.2 kW (approximately 105 hp), which is reasonable for a commercial elevator. The majority of the work (858 kJ out of 938 kJ total, or 91%) goes into lifting the 2500-kg load against gravity, while only 9% goes into accelerating the 10,000-kg system to its final speed of 4.00 m/s. This distribution is typical for elevators, where the primary energy expenditure is overcoming gravitational potential energy.

The counterbalancing system is an important practical feature mentioned in this problem. By counterbalancing most of the elevator's weight, the system ensures that the motor only needs to lift the net load (2500 kg) rather than the entire elevator plus passengers. However, the full mass (10,000 kg) must still be accelerated and decelerated, which is why we use the total mass when calculating kinetic energy. Without counterbalancing, elevator motors would need to be much more powerful and would consume far more energy.

Part (b): The electricity cost for this single elevator trip is approximately 2.3 cents. While this seems small, consider that a busy office building elevator might make hundreds of trips per day. At 200 trips per day, the daily cost would be about \$4.68, or roughly \$140 per month for continuous operation. In a large building with multiple elevators, these costs add up significantly, which is why modern buildings invest in energy-efficient elevator systems with regenerative braking that can recover energy during descent.

**Answer**

(a) The useful power output is approximately 78.2 kW.
(b) The electricity cost for this elevator trip is approximately \$0.023 (2.3 cents).

**(a)** Convert 18 months to seconds:

**Discussion**

Part (a): The battery contains approximately $$ 9.34 \times 10^{7} $$ J (about 26 kW·h) of energy. This is a substantial amount of energy—roughly equivalent to the energy in about 0.75 liters (0.2 gallons) of gasoline. The large energy storage capacity in a relatively small battery that can power a 2-W clock for 18 months demonstrates the energy density of modern batteries. This calculation shows why batteries are practical for low-power devices but become large and heavy for high-power applications like electric vehicles.

Part (b): The calculator can run for $$ 8.00 \times 10^{7} $$ s, which is approximately 2.54 years of continuous operation. This extraordinarily long runtime is possible because pocket calculators consume power at an extremely low rate—only 1.00 mW (0.001 W). Modern calculator chips use CMOS technology specifically designed for minimal power consumption. In practice, calculators often last even longer than this calculation suggests because they spend much of their time in sleep mode, consuming even less power. Additionally, many calculators use solar cells that recharge the battery during use.

The stark contrast between the clock battery (2 W for 18 months) and the calculator battery (0.001 W for 2.5 years) illustrates how power consumption, not just energy storage, determines battery life. The calculator's battery stores about 85% of the energy of the clock battery but lasts about 1.7 times longer because it consumes 2000 times less power.

**Strategy**

For part (a), the total energy needed is kinetic plus potential energy. With constant power, $$ W = Pt = \Delta E $$.

For part (b), we use the actual time to find the actual power needed.

For part (c), we use work-energy theorem including air resistance.

**Solution for (a)**

Total energy needed:

Actual power:

</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): Without air resistance, the airplane would reach its target speed and altitude in 223 s (about 3.7 minutes) using its full 100 MW of engine power. This represents the theoretical minimum time based purely on energy requirements. The total energy needed is 22.3 GJ, with about 79% going to potential energy (climbing to 12 km altitude) and only 21% to kinetic energy (reaching 250 m/s). This distribution shows that for this scenario, climbing is the dominant energy requirement.

Part (b): In reality, reaching the same energy state takes 900 s (15 minutes), which is about 4 times longer. The actual average power is 24.8 MW, which is only about 25% of the engines' rated power. This significant difference suggests the airplane is not operating at full throttle during the climb—a realistic scenario for commercial aviation where fuel efficiency and passenger comfort are prioritized over rapid climb rates.

Part (c): When the climb takes 1200 s (20 minutes), the average air resistance force is approximately 50,000 N. This substantial force is reasonable for a large aircraft—for comparison, a Boeing 747 has a maximum takeoff weight of about 4 million newtons, so an air resistance of 50,000 N represents about 1.25% of the maximum weight, which is consistent with typical drag forces during climb. The extra time (1200 s vs 900 s) means the airplane travels a longer distance (150 km vs an implied shorter distance for 900 s), encountering more air resistance overall. The calculation shows that approximately 25% of the engine work goes into overcoming air resistance (7.5 GJ out of 29.8 GJ total), with the remaining 75% providing the airplane's kinetic and potential energy. This illustrates why aerodynamic efficiency is crucial for aircraft fuel economy.

**Answer**

(a) Without air resistance, it would take 223 s to reach the target speed and altitude.
(b) The actual power output is 24.8 MW.

totaling 600 N. Explicitly show how you follow the steps in
the [Problem-Solving Strategies for Energy](./ch7ConservationOfEnergy#problemSolving).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Following the problem-solving strategy for energy:
1. **Identify knowns**: $$ m = 950 $$ kg, slope angle $$ \theta = 2.00^\circ $$, constant velocity $$ v = 30.0 $$ m/s, resistive forces $$ f = 600 $$ N
2. **Identify unknowns**: power output $$ P $$ of the car
3. **Choose relevant principle**: Since velocity is constant, the car is in equilibrium. The driving force must equal the sum of resistive forces (friction/air resistance) plus the component of gravity along the slope. Power is force times velocity: $$ P = Fv $$.

**Solution**

Since the car moves at constant velocity, the net force is zero. The driving force $$ F $$ must balance both the resistive forces and the gravitational component along the slope:

<div class="equation">
$$ F = f + mg\sin\theta $$
</div>

where $$ mg\sin\theta $$ is the component of the car's weight parallel to the incline.

Power is the rate of doing work, which for constant velocity equals:

<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{Fd}{t} = F\left(\frac{d}{t}\right) = Fv $$
</div>

Substituting the expression for $$ F $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ P = \left(f + mg\sin\theta\right)v $$
</div>

Now substitute the known values:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
P &=& \left[600\text{ N} + (950\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^{2})\sin(2.00^\circ)\right](30.0\text{ m/s})\\
P &=& \left[600\text{ N} + (9310\text{ N})(0.0349)\right](30.0\text{ m/s})\\
P &=& \left[600\text{ N} + 325\text{ N}\right](30.0\text{ m/s})\\
P &=& (925\text{ N})(30.0\text{ m/s})\\
P &=& 2.77 \times 10^{4}\text{ W} = 27.7\text{ kW}
\end{array} $$
</div>

Converting to horsepower:

<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{27,700\text{ W}}{746\text{ W/hp}} = 37.1\text{ hp} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The power output of approximately 27.7 kW (37 hp) is reasonable for a car climbing a gentle 2° incline at highway speed. This is well within the capability of most car engines, which typically produce 75-150 kW (100-200 hp).

Interestingly, the gravitational component (325 N) is smaller than the resistive forces (600 N) for this gentle slope. At 30.0 m/s (108 km/h or 67 mph), wind resistance dominates. About 65% of the power (600/925) goes to overcoming air resistance and friction, while 35% (325/925) goes to climbing the slope.

If the slope were steeper or the speed lower, the gravitational term would become more significant. For example, on a 10° slope, $$ mg\sin(10^\circ) $$ would be about 1620 N, making it the dominant resistance. This explains why cars must downshift and use more engine power on steep hills.

The constant-velocity condition is key to this solution's simplicity. If the car were accelerating, we would need to account for the rate of change of kinetic energy as well.

The power output needed is approximately $$ 2.77 \times 10^{4} $$ W (27.7 kW or 37.1 hp).

power plant that generates 750 MW if the collectors convert an average of 2.00%
of the maximum power into electricity. (This small conversion efficiency is due
to the devices themselves, and the fact that the sun is directly overhead only
briefly.) With the same assumptions, what area would be needed to meet the
United States' energy needs $$ \left( 1.05\times 10^{20} \J \right) $$ ?
Australia's energy needs $$ \left(5.4\times 10^{18} \J  \right) $$? China's
energy needs $$ \left(6.3\times 10^{19} \J  \right) $$ ?

**Strategy**

For part (a), the Sun's power spreads over a sphere with radius equal to Earth's orbital radius (1 AU = $$ 1.50 \times 10^{11}\m $$). Power per unit area is $$ P/(4\pi r^{2}) $$.

For part (b), the actual power collected per m² is $$ (1300\text{ W/m}^2)(0.02) = 26\text{ W/m}^2 $$.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{Power per m}^2 &=& \frac{4.00 \times 10^{26}\text{ W}}{4\pi(1.50 \times 10^{11}\m)^{2}}\\
&=& \frac{4.00 \times 10^{26}}{2.83 \times 10^{23}}\text{ W/m}^2\\
&=& 1.41 \times 10^{3}\text{ W/m}^2 = 1.41\text{ kW/m}^2
\end{array}
$$

</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Power collected per m²: $$ 1300\text{ W/m}^2 \times 0.02 = 26\text{ W/m}^2 $$

Area for 750 MW plant:

<div class="equation">
 $$ A = \frac{750 \times 10^{6}\text{ W}}{26\text{ W/m}^2} = 2.88 \times 10^{7}\text{ m}^2 = 28.8\text{ km}^2 $$
</div>

For annual energy needs, we need power in watts. Using 1 year = $$ 3.156 \times 10^{7}\s $$:

U.S. power = $$ \frac{1.05 \times 10^{20}\J}{3.156 \times 10^{7}\s} = 3.33 \times 10^{12}\text{ W} $$

<div class="equation">
 $$ A_{\text{US}} = \frac{3.33 \times 10^{12}\text{ W}}{26\text{ W/m}^2} = 1.28 \times 10^{11}\text{ m}^2 = 1.28 \times 10^{5}\text{ km}^2 $$
</div>

Australia: $$ A\_{\text{Aus}} = \frac{5.4 \times 10^{18}\J/(3.156 \times 10^{7}\s)}{26\text{ W/m}^2} = 6.6 \times 10^{3}\text{ km}^2 $$

China: $$ A\_{\text{China}} = \frac{6.3 \times 10^{19}\J/(3.156 \times 10^{7}\s)}{26\text{ W/m}^2} = 7.7 \times 10^{4}\text{ km}^2 $$

**Discussion**

Part (a): The calculated power per square meter at Earth's upper atmosphere is approximately 1.41 kW/m². This value, known as the solar constant, is in excellent agreement with measured values. The slight difference from the maximum 1.30 kW/m² mentioned in the problem as reaching Earth's surface is due to atmospheric absorption and reflection. About 30% of incoming solar radiation is reflected back into space by clouds, atmospheric particles, and Earth's surface (this is Earth's albedo), while additional energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. The calculation demonstrates that solar energy is distributed over an enormous sphere (with radius equal to Earth's orbital distance), which is why the power per unit area decreases so dramatically from the Sun's total output of $$ 4 \times 10^{26} $$ W.

Part (b): The area calculations reveal both the promise and challenge of solar energy:

- A 750-MW power plant requires approximately 28.8 km² of 2%-efficient solar collectors (about 5.4 km × 5.4 km). While this seems large, it's equivalent to about 7,100 acres, which is comparable to the land area used by large coal plants when including mining operations.

- The U.S. energy needs would require about 128,000 km² (roughly 350 km × 365 km), which is approximately 1.3% of U.S. land area. For perspective, this is similar to the area of the state of Louisiana.

- Australia needs about 6,600 km², roughly 0.09% of its land area—quite feasible given Australia's vast desert regions with excellent solar exposure.

- China needs about 77,000 km², approximately 0.8% of its land area.

These calculations assume only 2% efficiency (accounting for panel efficiency, sun angle, nighttime, and weather). Modern solar panels achieve 15-20% efficiency under ideal conditions, which would reduce required areas by a factor of 7-10, though real-world capacity factors (accounting for nighttime and weather) typically range from 15-25% in good locations. Even so, the calculations demonstrate that meeting national energy needs with solar power is technically feasible from an area perspective, though energy storage for nighttime use remains a significant challenge.

The comparison also highlights regional differences: Australia's low population and abundant sunshine make solar particularly attractive, while more densely populated or less sunny regions face greater challenges.

**Answer**

(a) The power per square meter reaching Earth's upper atmosphere is approximately 1.41 kW/m².
(b) The area required for a 750-MW plant is approximately 28.8 km². To meet annual energy needs with 2% efficient collectors: U.S. ≈ 128,000 km², Australia ≈ 6,600 km², China ≈ 77,000 km².
