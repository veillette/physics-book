### Multiple-Electron Atoms

All atoms except hydrogen are multiple-electron atoms. The physical and chemical
properties of elements are directly related to the number of electrons a neutral
atom has. The periodic table of the elements groups elements with similar
properties into columns. This systematic organization is related to the number
of electrons in a neutral atom, called the **atomic number**, $$Z $$ . We shall
see in this section that the exclusion principle is key to the underlying
explanations, and that it applies far beyond the realm of atomic physics.

In 1925, the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1))
proposed the following rule: No two electrons can have the same set of quantum
numbers. That is, no two electrons can be in the same state. This statement is
known as the **Pauli exclusion principle**, because it excludes electrons from
being in the same state. The Pauli exclusion principle is extremely powerful and
very broadly applicable. It applies to any identical particles with
half-integral intrinsic spin—that is, having $$s=1/2, 3/2, ... $$ Thus no two
electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers.

Let us examine how the exclusion principle applies to electrons in atoms. The
quantum numbers involved were defined in [Quantum Numbers and Rules](../contents/ch30QuantumNumbersAndRules) as
$$\mathrm{n, l,} {m}_{l}\mathrm{, s} $$ , and $${m}_{s} $$ . Since $$s $$ is
always $$1/2 $$ for electrons, it is redundant to list $$s $$ , and so we omit
it and specify the state of an electron by a set of four numbers $$\left(n, l, {m}_{l}, {m}_{s}\right) $$ . For example, the quantum numbers $$\left(2, 1, 0, -1/2\right) $$ completely specify the state of an electron in an atom. Since no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers, there are limits to how many of them can be in the same energy state. Note that $$n $$
determines the energy state in the absence of a magnetic field. So we first
choose $$n $$ , and then we see how many electrons can be in this energy state
or energy level. Consider the $$n=1 $$ level, for example. The only value $$l $$
can have is 0 (see [[Table 1]](../contents/ch30QuantumNumbersAndRules#Table1) for a list of
possible values once $$n $$ is known), and thus $${m}_{l} $$ can only be 0. The
spin projection $${m}_{s} $$ can be either $$+1/2 $$ or $$-1/2 $$ , and so there
can be two electrons in the $$n=1 $$ state. One has quantum numbers $$\left(1, 0, 0, +1/2\right) $$ , and the other has $$\left(1, 0, 0, -1/2\right) $$ .
[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) illustrates that there can be one or two electrons
having $$n=1 $$ , but not three.

![The figure here shows configuration of electrons. At the top, the key shows two purple balls, which depict electrons. The upward directed arrow on the first ball or electron shows its spin is plus one half, and the downward arrow on the second electron shows the opposite spin that is minus one half. Two other sections show the electronic configurations of electrons for two levels, n equal to one and n equal to two. One section shows the allowed configurations of the electron in the n is equal to one and two levels, and the second section for the configurations which are not allowed. In the allowed section, n is equal to two has three vacant shells and one electron in each of the outer two shells, one with spin up and one with spin down; and n is equal to one configuration has two shells containing one each spin up and spin down electron and the three other shells containing combinations of both spins each. For the not allowed section, n is equal to two have all vacant shells and n is equal to one have unevenly balanced electrons in its shells.](../resources/Figure_30_09_02.jpg 'The Pauli exclusion principle explains why some configurations of electrons are allowed while others are not. Since electrons cannot have the same set of quantum numbers, a maximum of two can be in the ( n=1 ) level, and a third electron must reside in the higher-energy ( n=2 ) level. If there are two electrons in the ( n=1 ) level, their spins must be in opposite directions. (More precisely, their spin projections must differ.)')

### Shells and Subshells

Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, only hydrogen and helium can have all
of their electrons in the $$n=1 $$ state. Lithium (see the periodic table) has
three electrons, and so one must be in the $$n=2 $$ level. This leads to the
concept of shells and shell filling. As we progress up in the number of
electrons, we go from hydrogen to helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, and so on,
and we see that there are limits to the number of electrons for each value of
$$n $$ . Higher values of the shell $$n $$ correspond to higher energies, and
they can allow more electrons because of the various combinations of $$l, {m}_{l} $$ , and $${m}_{s} $$ that are possible. Each value of the principal quantum
number $$n $$ thus corresponds to an atomic **shell** into which a limited
number of electrons can go. Shells and the number of electrons in them determine
the physical and chemical properties of atoms, since it is the outermost
electrons that interact most with anything outside the atom.

The probability clouds of electrons with the lowest value of $$l $$ are closest
to the nucleus and, thus, more tightly bound. Thus when shells fill, they start
with $$l=0 $$ , progress to $$l=1 $$ , and so on. Each value of $$l $$ thus
corresponds to a **subshell**.

The table given below lists symbols traditionally used to denote shells and
subshells.

To denote shells and subshells, we write $$\text{nl} $$ with a number for $$n $$
and a letter for $$l $$ . For example, an electron in the $$n=1 $$ state must
have $$l=0 $$ , and it is denoted as a $$1s $$ electron. Two electrons in the
$$n=1 $$ state is denoted as $$1{s}^{2} $$ . Another example is an electron in
the $$n=2 $$ state with $$l=1 $$ , written as $$2p $$ . The case of three
electrons with these quantum numbers is written $$2{p}^{3} $$ . This notation,
called spectroscopic notation, is generalized as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)
.

![Diagram illustrating the components of the expression 2 times p to the third power, where 2 is the principal quantum number n, p is the angular momentum quantum number, represented by a script letter l, and the exponent 3 is the number of electrons.](../resources/Figure_30_09_05.jpg ' ')
{: #Figure3}

Counting the number of possible combinations of quantum numbers allowed by the
exclusion principle, we can determine how many electrons it takes to fill each
subshell and shell.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
How Many Electrons Can Be in This Shell?
</div>
List all the possible sets of quantum numbers for the  $$n=2 $$
 shell, and determine the number of electrons that can be in the shell and each of its subshells.

**Strategy**

Given $$n=2 $$ for the shell, the rules for quantum numbers limit $$l $$ to be 0
or 1. The shell therefore has two subshells, labeled $$2s $$ and $$2p $$ . Since
the lowest $$l $$ subshell fills first, we start with the $$2s $$ subshell
possibilities and then proceed with the $$2p $$ subshell.

**Solution**

It is convenient to list the possible quantum numbers in a table, as shown
below.

![Image contains a table listing all possible quantum numbers for the n equals 2 shell. The table shows that there are a total of two electrons in the 2 s subshell and six electrons in the 2 p subshell, for a total of eight electrons in the shell.](../resources/Figure_30_09_04.jpg ' ')
{: #Figure4}

**Discussion**

It is laborious to make a table like this every time we want to know how many
electrons can be in a shell or subshell. There exist general rules that are easy
to apply, as we shall now see.

</div>

The number of electrons that can be in a subshell depends entirely on the value
of $$l $$ . Once $$l $$ is known, there are a fixed number of values of $${m}_{l} $$ , each of which can have two values for $${m}_{s} $$ First, since $${m}_{l} $$ goes from $$-l $$ to _l_ in steps of 1, there are $$2l+1 $$ possibilities. This number is multiplied by 2, since each electron can be spin up or spin down. Thus the _maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell_ is $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$.

For example, the $$2s $$ subshell in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) has a maximum of 2
electrons in it, since $$2\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(0+1\right)=2 $$ for this
subshell. Similarly, the $$2p $$ subshell has a maximum of 6 electrons, since
$$2\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(2+1\right)=6 $$ . For a shell, the maximum number is
the sum of what can fit in the subshells. Some algebra shows that the _maximum
number of electrons that can be in a shell_ is $$2{n}^{2} $$.

For example, for the first shell $$n=1 $$ , and so $$2{n}^{2}=2 $$ . We have
already seen that only two electrons can be in the $$n=1 $$ shell. Similarly,
for the second shell, $$n=2 $$ , and so $$2{n}^{2}=8 $$ . As found
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), the total number of electrons in the $$n=2 $$ shell
is 8.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Subshells and Totals for  $$n=3 $$
</div>
How many subshells are in the  $$n=3 $$
 shell? Identify each subshell, calculate the maximum number of electrons that will fit into each, and verify that the total is  $$2{n}^{2} $$.

**Strategy**

Subshells are determined by the value of $$l $$ ; thus, we first determine which
values of $$\text{l} $$ are allowed, and then we apply the equation “maximum
number of electrons that can be in a subshell $$=2\left(2l+1\right) $$ ” to find
the number of electrons in each subshell.

**Solution**

Since $$n=3 $$ , we know that $$l $$ can be $$0, 1 $$ , or $$2 $$ ; thus, there
are three possible subshells. In standard notation, they are labeled the $$3s $$
, $$3p $$ , and $$3d $$ subshells. We have already seen that 2 electrons can be
in an $$s $$ state, and 6 in a $$p $$
\*\* state, but let us use the equation “maximum number of electrons that can be
in a subshell = $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ ” to calculate the maximum number in
each:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{l}3s \text{has} l=0\text{;} \text{thus} \text{,}  2\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(0+1\right)=2\\ 3p \text{has} l=1 \text{; thus, 2}\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(2+1\right)=6\\ 3d \text{has} l=2 \text{; thus, 2}\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(4+1\right)=10\\ \text{Total}=18\\ \left(\text{in the} n=3 \text{shell}\right)\end{array} $$
</div>
The equation “maximum number of electrons that can be in a shell =  $$2{n}^{2} $$
” gives the maximum number in the  $$n=3 $$  shell to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Maximum number of electrons}=2{n}^{2}=2{\left(3\right)}^{2}=2\left(9\right)=18 \text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The total number of electrons in the three possible subshells is thus the same
as the formula $$2{n}^{2} $$ . In standard (spectroscopic) notation, a filled
$$n=3 $$ shell is denoted as $$3{s}^{2}3{p}^{6}3{d}^{10} $$ . Shells do not fill
in a simple manner. Before the $$n=3 $$ shell is completely filled, for example,
we begin to find electrons in the $$n=4 $$ shell.

</div>

### Shell Filling and the Periodic Table

[[Table 2]](#Table2) shows electron configurations for the first 20 elements in
the periodic table, starting with hydrogen and its single electron and ending
with calcium. The Pauli exclusion principle determines the maximum number of
electrons allowed in each shell and subshell. But the order in which the shells
and subshells are filled is complicated because of the large numbers of
interactions between electrons.

Columns 3 through 8 list the ground state configurations for each element. Many of the cells in these columns are blank because some elements have fewer than six ground state configurations.

Examining the above table, you can see that as the number of electrons in an
atom increases from 1 in hydrogen to 2 in helium and so on, the lowest-energy
shell gets filled first—that is, the $$n=1 $$ shell fills first, and then the
$$n=2 $$ shell begins to fill. Within a shell, the subshells fill starting with
the lowest $$l $$ , or with the $$s $$ subshell, then the $$p $$ , and so on,
usually until all subshells are filled. The first exception to this occurs for
potassium, where the $$4s $$ subshell begins to fill before any electrons go
into the $$3d $$ subshell. The next exception is not shown
in [[Table 2]](#Table2); it occurs for rubidium, where the $$5s $$ subshell
starts to fill before the $$4d $$ subshell. The reason for these exceptions is
that $$l=0 $$ electrons have probability clouds that penetrate closer to the
nucleus and, thus, are more tightly bound (lower in energy).

[[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows the periodic table of the elements, through
element 118. Of special interest are elements in the main groups, namely, those
in the columns numbered 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

![This picture shows the periodic table of the elements.](../resources/Figure_30_09_03.jpg 'Periodic table of the elements (credit: National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce)')
{: #Figure5}

The number of electrons in the outermost subshell determines the atom’s chemical
properties, since it is these electrons that are farthest from the nucleus and
thus interact most with other atoms. If the outermost subshell can accept or
give up an electron easily, then the atom will be highly reactive chemically.
Each group in the periodic table is characterized by its outermost electron
configuration. Perhaps the most familiar is Group 18 (Group VIII), the noble
gases (helium, neon, argon, etc.). These gases are all characterized by a filled
outer subshell that is particularly stable. This means that they have large
ionization energies and do not readily give up an electron. Furthermore, if they
were to accept an extra electron, it would be in a significantly higher level
and thus loosely bound. Chemical reactions often involve sharing electrons.
Noble gases can be forced into unstable chemical compounds only under high
pressure and temperature.

Group 17 (Group VII) contains the halogens, such as fluorine, chlorine, iodine
and bromine, each of which has one less electron than a neighboring noble gas.
Each halogen has 5 $$p $$ electrons (a $${p}^{5} $$ configuration), while the
$$p $$ subshell can hold 6 electrons. This means the halogens have one vacancy
in their outermost subshell. They thus readily accept an extra electron (it
becomes tightly bound, closing the shell as in noble gases) and are highly
reactive chemically. The halogens are also likely to form singly negative ions,
such as $${C1}^{-} $$ , fitting an extra electron into the vacancy in the outer
subshell. In contrast, alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, all have a
single $$s $$ electron in their outermost subshell (an $${s}^{1} $$
configuration) and are members of Group 1 (Group I). These elements easily give
up their extra electron and are thus highly reactive chemically. As you might
expect, they also tend to form singly positive ions, such as $${\text{Na}}^{+} $$

, by losing their loosely bound outermost electron. They are metals (
conductors), because the loosely bound outer electron can move freely.

Of course, other groups are also of interest. Carbon, silicon, and germanium,
for example, have similar chemistries and are in Group 4 (Group IV). Carbon, in
particular, is extraordinary in its ability to form many types of bonds and to
be part of long chains, such as inorganic molecules. The large group of what are
called transitional elements is characterized by the filling of the $$d $$
subshells and crossing of energy levels. Heavier groups, such as the lanthanide
series, are more complex—their shells do not fill in simple order. But the
groups recognized by chemists such as Mendeleev have an explanation in the
substructure of atoms.

### Section Summary

* The state of a system is completely described by a complete set of quantum
  numbers. This set is written as $$\left(\mathrm{n, l,} {m}_{l}, {m}_{s}\right) $$ .

* The Pauli exclusion principle says that no two electrons can have the same set
  of quantum numbers; that is, no two electrons can be in the same state.
* This exclusion limits the number of electrons in atomic shells and subshells.
  Each value of $$n $$ corresponds to a shell, and each value of $$l $$
  corresponds to a subshell.
* The maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell is $$2\left( 2l+1\right) $$ .

* The maximum number of electrons that can be in a shell is $$2{n}^{2} $$ .

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Identify the shell, subshell, and number of electrons for the following: (a)  $$2{p}^{3} $$ .
 (b)  $$4{d}^{9} $$ .
 (c)  $$3{s}^{1} $$ .
 (d)  $$5{g}^{16} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Solution**

(a) $$2{p}^{3} $$ : Shell $$n=2 $$ , subshell $$p $$ (which means $$l=1 $$ ), 3 electrons.

(b) $$4{d}^{9} $$ : Shell $$n=4 $$ , subshell $$d $$ (which means $$l=2 $$ ), 9 electrons.

(c) $$3{s}^{1} $$ : Shell $$n=3 $$ , subshell $$s $$ (which means $$l=0 $$ ), 1 electron.

(d) $$5{g}^{16} $$ : Shell $$n=5 $$ , subshell $$g $$ (which means $$l=4 $$ ), 16 electrons.

**Discussion**

In spectroscopic notation $$\text{nl}^{x} $$ , the number gives the principal quantum number $$n $$ (the shell), the letter gives the orbital angular momentum quantum number $$l $$ (the subshell: $$s, p, d, f, g, h... $$ correspond to $$l=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... $$ ), and the superscript gives the number of electrons in that subshell.

Which of the following are not allowed? State which rule is violated for any that are not allowed. (a)  $$1{p}^{3} $$
 (b)  $$2{p}^{8} $$
(c)  $$3{g}^{11} $$
 (d)  $$4{f}^{2} $$
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Solution**

(a) $$1{p}^{3} $$ is **not allowed**. For $$n=1 $$ , the only allowed value of $$l $$ is $$l=0 $$ (the $$s $$ subshell). The rule $$l<n $$ is violated, since $$p $$ corresponds to $$l=1 $$ , but $$l $$ must be less than $$n=1 $$ .

(b) $$2{p}^{8} $$ is **not allowed**. The $$p $$ subshell has $$l=1 $$ , so it can hold a maximum of $$2\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(2\cdot 1+1\right)=6 $$ electrons. Having 8 electrons exceeds this maximum.

(c) $$3{g}^{11} $$ is **not allowed**. For $$n=3 $$ , the maximum value of $$l $$ is $$l=n-1=2 $$ (the $$d $$ subshell). The $$g $$ subshell corresponds to $$l=4 $$ , which violates the rule $$l<n $$ .

(d) $$4{f}^{2} $$ is **allowed**. For $$n=4 $$ , $$l $$ can range from 0 to 3. The $$f $$ subshell corresponds to $$l=3 $$ , which satisfies $$l<n $$ . The $$f $$ subshell can hold up to $$2\left(2l+1\right)=2\left(2\cdot 3+1\right)=14 $$ electrons, so having 2 electrons is allowed.

(a) What is the minimum value of 1 for a subshell that has 11 electrons in it?

(b) If this subshell is in the $$n=5 $$ shell, what is the spectroscopic
notation for this atom?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The maximum number of electrons that can occupy a subshell is given by $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ . We need to find the minimum value of $$l $$ such that this maximum is at least 11.

**Solution**

(a) We need $$2\left(2l+1\right)\ge 11 $$ . Solving for $$l $$ :

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{l}2\left(2l+1\right)\ge 11\\ 2l+1\ge 5.5\\ 2l\ge 4.5\\ l\ge 2.25\end{array} $$
</div>
Since $$l $$ must be an integer, the minimum value is $$l=3 $$ . We can verify: $$2\left(2\cdot 3+1\right)=2\left(7\right)=14 $$ electrons maximum, which can indeed hold 11 electrons. Note that $$l=2 $$ would only allow $$2\left(2\cdot 2+1\right)=10 $$ electrons, which is insufficient.

(b) For $$n=5 $$ and $$l=3 $$ , the subshell is $$f $$ (since $$l=3 $$ corresponds to the $$f $$ subshell). The spectroscopic notation is $$5{f}^{11} $$ .

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates how the Pauli exclusion principle limits the number of electrons in each subshell. The $$f $$ subshell ( $$l=3 $$ ) is the smallest subshell that can accommodate 11 electrons. This is relevant for understanding the electron configurations of heavy elements in the lanthanide and actinide series, where $$f $$ orbitals begin to fill.

- $$\left(3, 2, -2, +1/2\right) $$

Total: 10 electrons in $$3d $$

**Total electrons in $$n=3 $$ shell**: $$2+6+10=18 $$

(b) For each subshell, we can verify $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ :
- $$3s $$ : $$2\left(2\cdot 0+1\right)=2\left(1\right)=2 $$ ✓

- $$3d $$ : $$2\left(2\cdot 2+1\right)=2\left(5\right)=10 $$ ✓

For the entire shell: $$2{n}^{2}=2{\left(3\right)}^{2}=2\left(9\right)=18 $$ ✓

**Discussion**

This systematic enumeration demonstrates how the Pauli exclusion principle limits electron capacity. Each unique set of quantum numbers can hold exactly one electron. The factor of 2 in $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ comes from the two possible spin states ( $${m}_{s}=±1/2 $$ ), while $$2l+1 $$ represents the number of possible $${m}_{l} $$ values for a given $$l $$ . The formula $$2{n}^{2} $$ emerges from summing over all possible $$l $$ values for a given $$n $$ .

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For each notation, we must check two conditions: (1) $$l<n $$ , and (2) the number of electrons does not exceed $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ for that subshell.

**Solution**

(a) $$1{s}^{1} $$ is **allowed**. For $$n=1 $$ , we can have $$l=0 $$ ( $$s $$ subshell). The maximum number of electrons is $$2\left(2\cdot 0+1\right)=2 $$ , so having 1 electron is allowed.

(b) $$1{d}^{3} $$ is **not allowed**. The $$d $$ subshell corresponds to $$l=2 $$ . For $$n=1 $$ , the maximum value of $$l $$ is $$n-1=0 $$ . Since $$l=2>n=1 $$ violates the rule $$l<n $$ , this configuration is forbidden.

(c) $$4{s}^{2} $$ is **allowed**. For $$n=4 $$ , we can have $$l=0 $$ ( $$s $$ subshell). The maximum number of electrons is $$2\left(2\cdot 0+1\right)=2 $$ , so having 2 electrons exactly fills this subshell.

(d) $$3{p}^{7} $$ is **not allowed**. The $$p $$ subshell has $$l=1 $$ , which is allowed for $$n=3 $$ . However, the maximum number of electrons in a $$p $$ subshell is $$2\left(2\cdot 1+1\right)=6 $$ . Having 7 electrons exceeds this limit.

(e) $$6{h}^{20} $$ is **allowed**. The $$h $$ subshell corresponds to $$l=5 $$ . For $$n=6 $$ , the maximum value of $$l $$ is $$n-1=5 $$ , so $$l=5 $$ is allowed. The maximum number of electrons is $$2\left(2\cdot 5+1\right)=2\left(11\right)=22 $$ , so having 20 electrons is within the limit.

**Discussion**

The allowed configurations are **(a), (c), and (e)**. This problem reinforces the two fundamental constraints on electron configurations: the orbital angular momentum quantum number must satisfy $$l\le n-1 $$ , and the number of electrons in a subshell cannot exceed $$2\left(2l+1\right) $$ . These constraints arise directly from the Pauli exclusion principle and the rules governing quantum numbers.

Estimate the density of a nucleus by calculating the density of a proton, taking
it to be a sphere 1.2 fm in diameter. Compare your result with the value
estimated in this chapter.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We can estimate nuclear density by treating a proton as a sphere with diameter $$d=1.2 \text{ fm}=1.2\times 10^{-15} \text{ m} $$ . The density is $$\rho =m/V $$ , where the mass of a proton is $${m}_{p}=1.67\times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} $$ and the volume is $$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi {r}^{3} $$ .

**Solution**

The radius of the proton is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$r=\frac{d}{2}=\frac{1.2\times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}{2}= 6.0\times 10^{-16} \text{ m} $$
</div>
The volume is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi {r}^{3}=\frac{4}{3}\pi {\left( 6.0\times 10^{-16} \text{ m}\right)}^{3}= 9.05\times 10^{-46} {\text{ m}}^{3} $$
</div>
The density is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}=\frac{1.67\times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}}{ 9.05\times 10^{-46} {\text{ m}}^{3}}= 1.8\times 10^{17} \text{ kg/}{\text{m}}^{3} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This density is extraordinarily large—about $$10^{14} $$ times greater than the density of water ( $$10^{3} \text{ kg/}{\text{m}}^{3} $$ ) or solid matter ( $$\sim 10^{4} \text{ kg/}{\text{m}}^{3} $$ ). This result is typical of nuclear densities and demonstrates that nuclei are incredibly compact objects. All atomic nuclei have approximately the same density because they are composed of closely packed nucleons (protons and neutrons). This uniform density is a key feature of the nuclear structure and validates the liquid drop model of the nucleus.

(a) What is the distance between the slits of a diffraction grating that produces a first-order maximum for the first Balmer line at an angle of  $$20.0 ^\circ $$ ?

order?

(c) At what angle will the second-order maximum be for the first line?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The diffraction grating equation is $$d\sin\theta =m\lambda $$ , where $$d $$ is the slit separation, $$\theta $$ is the angle, $$m $$ is the order, and $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength. The first Balmer line ( $${n}_{\text{i}}=3 $$ to $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ ) has $$\lambda =656 \text{ nm} $$ . The fourth line ( $${n}_{\text{i}}=6 $$ to $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ ) has $$\lambda =410 \text{ nm} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) For $$m=1 $$ , $$\theta =20.0^\circ $$ , and $$\lambda =656 \text{ nm} $$ :

<div class="equation" >
 $$d=\frac{m\lambda }{\sin\theta }=\frac{\left(1\right)\left(656\times 10^{-9} \text{ m}\right)}{\sin 20.0^\circ }=\frac{656\times 10^{-9} \text{ m}}{0.342}= 1.92\times 10^{-6} \text{ m}=1.92 \text{ μm} $$
</div>
(b) For the fourth Balmer line with $$\lambda =410 \text{ nm} $$ , $$m=1 $$ , and $$d= 1.92\times 10^{-6} \text{ m} $$ :

 $$\sin\theta =\frac{m\lambda }{d}=\frac{\left(1\right)\left(410\times 10^{-9} \text{ m}\right)}{ 1.92\times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}=0.214 $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\theta ={\sin}^{-1}\left(0.214\right)=12.4^\circ $$

 $$\sin\theta =\frac{m\lambda }{d}=\frac{\left(2\right)\left(656\times 10^{-9} \text{ m}\right)}{ 1.92\times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}=0.683 $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\theta ={\sin}^{-1}\left(0.683\right)=43.1^\circ $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Diffraction gratings are powerful tools for analyzing spectral lines. The angular separation of different wavelengths increases with order $$m $$ , but higher orders also require larger angles. Note that shorter wavelengths (like the fourth Balmer line at 410 nm) appear at smaller angles than longer wavelengths (like the first line at 656 nm), which is why dispersive elements can separate colors. This technique is fundamental to spectroscopy and was crucial in the early studies of atomic structure.

Calculate the velocity of a star moving relative to the earth if you observe a

the lowest orbital (that is, a $${n}_{\text{i}}=\infty $$ to $${n}_{\text{f}}=1 $$ , or a Lyman series transition).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

First, we need to find the rest wavelength for the transition $${n}_{\text{i}}=\infty $$ to $${n}_{\text{f}}=1 $$ using the Rydberg formula. Then we can use the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic velocities: $$\frac{\Delta \lambda }{\lambda }=\frac{v}{c} $$ .

**Solution**

The Rydberg formula gives:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$

The star is moving **toward** Earth at approximately **526 km/s**.

**Discussion**

This large velocity is typical of stellar motions in our galaxy. The blueshift (shorter observed wavelength) indicates motion toward us. This Lyman series limit transition ( $$n=\infty $$ to $$n=1 $$ ) corresponds to the ionization edge of hydrogen and is an important feature in stellar spectra.

First, we need to find the wavelength of 25.0-keV X-rays using $$E=hf=hc/\lambda $$ . Then we can use the double-slit equation $$d\sin\theta =m\lambda $$ to find the slit separation $$d $$ .

**Solution**

The wavelength of the X-rays is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =\frac{hc}{E}=\frac{\left( 6.63\times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot \text{s}\right)\left( 3.00\times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}\right)}{25.0\times 10^{3} \text{ eV}\times 1.60\times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} $$

 $$d= 9.50\times 10^{-10} \text{ m}=0.950 \text{ nm} $$

**Discussion**

This slit separation of about 1 nm is on the order of atomic dimensions (typical atomic radii are 0.1–0.3 nm, and atomic spacings in crystals are 0.2–0.5 nm). This explains why X-ray diffraction is performed using crystal lattices rather than manufactured gratings—the regular spacing of atoms in crystals provides the necessary small-scale structure. X-ray crystallography has been instrumental in determining molecular structures, including the double helix structure of DNA. The wave nature of X-rays at these energy levels is essential for such applications.

Find the value of $$l $$ , the orbital angular momentum quantum number, for the
moon around the earth. The extremely large value obtained implies that it is
impossible to tell the difference between adjacent quantized orbits for
macroscopic objects.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The orbital angular momentum of the moon is $$L=mvr $$ , where $$m $$ is the moon's mass, $$v $$ is its orbital velocity, and $$r $$ is its orbital radius. According to quantum mechanics, $$L=\sqrt{l\left(l+1\right)}\hbar $$ . For large $$l $$ , this simplifies to $$L\approx l\hbar $$ , so $$l\approx L/\hbar $$ .

**Solution**

First, we need the moon's orbital angular momentum. Using:
- Moon's mass: $$m= 7.35\times 10^{22} \text{ kg} $$
- Orbital radius: $$r= 3.84\times 10^{8} \text{ m} $$
- Orbital period: $$T=27.3 \text{ days}= 2.36\times 10^{6} \text{ s} $$

The orbital velocity is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}=\frac{2\pi \left( 3.84\times 10^{8} \text{ m}\right)}{ 2.36\times 10^{6} \text{ s}}= 1.02\times 10^{3} \text{ m/s} $$
</div>
The orbital angular momentum is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=mvr=\left( 7.35\times 10^{22} \text{ kg}\right)\left( 1.02\times 10^{3} \text{ m/s}\right)\left( 3.84\times 10^{8} \text{ m}\right) $$

 $$L= 2.88\times 10^{34} \text{ kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\text{/s} $$

 $$l\approx \frac{L}{\hbar }=\frac{ 2.88\times 10^{34} \text{ kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\text{/s}}{ 1.055\times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot \text{s}}= 2.73\times 10^{68} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This extraordinarily large quantum number demonstrates why quantum effects are unobservable for macroscopic objects. The difference between adjacent quantum states would be $$\Delta L=\hbar = 1.055\times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot \text{s} $$ , which is completely negligible compared to the total angular momentum of $$ 2.88\times 10^{34} \text{ kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\text{/s} $$ . The fractional change would be $$\Delta L/L\sim 10^{-68} $$ , far too small to measure. This illustrates the correspondence principle: quantum mechanics gives the same results as classical mechanics for macroscopic systems.

Calculate the minimum amount of energy in joules needed to create a population
inversion in a helium-neon laser containing $$ 1.00 \times 10^{-4} $$ moles of
neon.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

A helium-neon laser produces red light at $$\lambda =632.8 \text{ nm} $$ . To create a population inversion, at least half of the neon atoms must be excited to the upper laser level. The energy per photon is $$E=hc/\lambda $$ . We need to find the total energy to excite half of the neon atoms.

**Solution**

The energy per photon is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }=\frac{\left( 6.63\times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot \text{s}\right)\left( 3.00\times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}\right)}{632.8\times 10^{-9} \text{ m}} $$

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{ 1.989\times 10^{-25} \text{ J}\cdot \text{m}}{ 6.328\times 10^{-7} \text{ m}}= 3.14\times 10^{-19} \text{ J} $$

 $$N=n{N}_{\text{A}}=\left( 1.00\times 10^{-4} \text{ mol}\right)\left( 6.022\times 10^{23} {\text{ atoms/mol}}\right)= 6.022\times 10^{19} \text{ atoms} $$
</div>
For a population inversion, at least half the atoms must be in the excited state:

<div class="equation" >
 $${N}_{\text{excited}}=\frac{N}{2}=\frac{ 6.022\times 10^{19}}{2}= 3.01\times 10^{19} \text{ atoms} $$

The total energy required is:

 $${E}_{\text{total}}={N}_{\text{excited}}\times E=\left( 3.01\times 10^{19}\right)\left( 3.14\times 10^{-19} \text{ J}\right)=9.45 \text{ J} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This represents the minimum energy needed to create a population inversion. In practice, more energy is required because not all the pump energy efficiently excites the neon atoms, and some atoms spontaneously emit before stimulated emission occurs. Helium-neon lasers use electrical discharge to excite helium atoms first, which then transfer energy to neon atoms through collisions, creating the population inversion necessary for laser action. The relatively modest energy requirement (less than 10 J) explains why He-Ne lasers are efficient and commonly used in laboratories and laser pointers.

The MRI photon energy is about **2.4 million times smaller** than typical molecular binding energies.

This enormous difference explains why MRI is safe and non-destructive. The radio wave photons used in MRI have far too little energy to break chemical bonds or ionize atoms. Instead, MRI works by detecting the magnetic resonance of hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the body's water and fat molecules. The low-energy photons can flip nuclear spins without damaging tissue, making MRI an ideal diagnostic tool. In contrast, X-rays and gamma rays have energies comparable to or greater than binding energies, which is why they can damage DNA and living tissue.

A neighboring galaxy rotates on its axis so that stars on one side move toward

This line broadening effect is a powerful tool for astronomers to study galactic rotation.

This technique has been crucial in discovering dark matter—galaxies rotate faster than expected based on visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of unseen mass.

Prove that the velocity of charged particles moving along a straight path
through perpendicular electric and magnetic fields is $$v=E/B $$ . Thus crossed
electric and magnetic fields can be used as a velocity selector independent of
the charge and mass of the particle involved.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a charged particle to move in a straight line through crossed electric and magnetic fields, the electric force and magnetic force must exactly balance. The electric force is $${F}_{E}=qE $$ and the magnetic force is $${F}_{B}=qvB $$ (for perpendicular velocity and field).

**Solution**

For a particle with charge $$q $$ moving with velocity $$v $$ :

The **electric force** is:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{E}=qE $$
</div>
The **magnetic force** is:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{B}=qvB $$
</div>
For the particle to travel in a straight line, these forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{E}={F}_{B} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$qE=qvB $$
</div>
Dividing both sides by $$q $$ and $$B $$ :

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{E}{B} $$
</div>
Notice that this result is **independent of both charge $$q $$ and mass $$m $$** of the particle.

**Discussion**

This elegant result shows that only particles with velocity $$v=E/B $$ will pass through undeflected, regardless of their charge or mass. Particles moving faster will be deflected more by the magnetic force, while slower particles will be deflected more by the electric force. This principle is used in mass spectrometers and particle physics experiments to select particles with specific velocities. J.J. Thomson used this technique in his cathode ray experiments to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of electrons. The velocity selector is a beautiful example of how electric and magnetic forces can be balanced to achieve precise control over charged particle beams.

**Unreasonable Results**

A student in a physics laboratory observes a hydrogen spectrum with a
diffraction grating for the purpose of measuring the wavelengths of the emitted
radiation. In the spectrum, she observes a yellow line and finds its wavelength
to be 589 nm. (a) Assuming this is part of the Balmer series, determine $${n}_{\text{i}} $$ , the principal quantum number of the initial state. (b) What is
unreasonable about this result? (c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or
inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The Balmer series has $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ . We can use the Rydberg formula $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$ to solve for $${n}_{\text{i}} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) Using the Rydberg formula with $$\lambda =589 \text{ nm}= 5.89\times 10^{-7} \text{ m} $$ , $$R= 1.097\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1} $$ , and $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ :

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ 5.89\times 10^{-7} \text{ m}}= 1.097\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$ 1.698\times 10^{6} {\text{ m}}^{-1}= 1.097\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$0.1548=\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}=0.250-0.1548=0.0952 $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $${n}_{\text{i}}^{2}=10.5 $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $${n}_{\text{i}}=3.24 $$
</div>
(b) The result $${n}_{\text{i}}=3.24 $$ is **unreasonable** because the principal quantum number $$n $$ must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). A non-integer value violates the fundamental quantization condition.

(c) The assumption that the 589-nm yellow line is part of the hydrogen Balmer series is **incorrect**. In reality, 589 nm is the famous sodium D-line doublet (589.0 nm and 589.6 nm), not a hydrogen line. The student likely observed sodium contamination in the hydrogen lamp or confused the spectral lines. The Balmer series wavelengths are: 656 nm (red), 486 nm (cyan), 434 nm (blue), and 410 nm (violet)—none are yellow.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the importance of recognizing when results don't make physical sense. Non-integer quantum numbers should immediately signal an error in assumptions or calculations. The 589-nm sodium lines are extremely common in laboratory spectra because sodium is ubiquitous (from salt, fingerprints, etc.) and has a very strong emission at this wavelength, which is why sodium vapor lamps produce characteristic yellow light. This highlights the need for careful spectral identification and understanding of atomic physics principles.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

The solar corona is so hot that most atoms in it are ionized. Consider a
hydrogen-like atom in the corona that has only a single electron. Construct a
problem in which you calculate selected spectral energies and wavelengths of the
Lyman, Balmer, or other series of this atom that could be used to identify its
presence in a very hot gas. You will need to choose the atomic number of the
atom, identify the element, and choose which spectral lines to consider.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

To construct this problem, we need to: (1) choose a highly ionized element likely present in the solar corona, (2) identify specific spectral transitions, and (3) calculate wavelengths and energies that could be observed.

**Solution**

**Example Problem Construction:**

The solar corona has temperatures of 1–2 million kelvin, hot enough to fully ionize lighter elements. Consider **helium II** (He<sup>+</sup>), which is singly ionized helium with $$Z=2 $$ and one electron, making it hydrogen-like.

**Part (a):** Calculate the wavelength of the first line in the Lyman series (transition from $$n=2 $$ to $$n=1 $$ ) for He<sup>+</sup>.

For hydrogen-like ions, the wavelengths are modified by $$Z^2 $$ :

<div class="equation" >
 {% raw %}$$\frac{1}{\lambda }={Z}^{2}R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right)={2}^{2}\left( 1.097\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1}\right)\left(\frac{1}{{1}^{2}}-\frac{1}{{2}^{2}}\right) $${% endraw %}
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=4\left( 1.097\times 10^{7}\right)\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)= 3.29\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =30.4 \text{ nm (extreme UV)} $$
</div>
**Part (b):** Calculate the photon energy for this transition.

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }=\frac{\left( 6.63\times 10^{-34}\right)\left( 3.00\times 10^{8}\right)}{30.4\times 10^{-9}}= 6.54\times 10^{-18} \text{ J}=40.9 \text{ eV} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This approach can be extended to other ions like O<sup>7+</sup> ( $$Z=8 $$ ) or Fe<sup>25+</sup> ( $$Z=26 $$ ), which are observed in coronal spectra. The high $$Z $$ values shift spectral lines to much shorter wavelengths (UV and X-ray regions), which is why space-based telescopes are essential for coronal observations. Students could construct variations by: (1) choosing different elements, (2) examining different series (Balmer, Paschen), (3) calculating ionization energies, or (4) comparing multiple transitions to create a spectral fingerprint for element identification. This problem teaches how atomic spectroscopy is used to determine the composition and temperature of stellar atmospheres.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider the Doppler-shifted hydrogen spectrum received from a rapidly receding
galaxy. Construct a problem in which you calculate the energies of selected
spectral lines in the Balmer series and examine whether they can be described
with a formula like that in the equation $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$ , but with a
different constant $$R $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

To construct this problem, we need to: (1) choose a recession velocity for the galaxy, (2) calculate Doppler-shifted wavelengths for several Balmer series lines, (3) determine if the shifted wavelengths follow the Rydberg formula with a modified constant, and (4) relate the modified constant to the recession velocity.

**Solution**

**Example Problem Construction:**

A distant galaxy is receding from Earth at $$v=0.050c $$ ( $$1.50\times 10^{7} \text{ m/s} $$ or 5% the speed of light).

**Part (a):** Calculate the observed wavelengths for the first three Balmer series lines.

For non-relativistic Doppler shift: $${\lambda }_{\text{observed}}={\lambda }_{0}\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right) $$

First Balmer line ( $$n=3 $$ to $$n=2 $$ ): $${\lambda }_{0}=656 \text{ nm} $$

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}=656\left(1+0.050\right)=656\times 1.050=689 \text{ nm} $$
</div>
Second Balmer line ( $$n=4 $$ to $$n=2 $$ ): $${\lambda }_{0}=486 \text{ nm} $$

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}=486\times 1.050=510 \text{ nm} $$
</div>
Third Balmer line ( $$n=5 $$ to $$n=2 $$ ): $${\lambda }_{0}=434 \text{ nm} $$

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}=434\times 1.050=456 \text{ nm} $$
</div>
**Part (b):** Determine if these wavelengths follow $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\text{'}\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$ with a modified Rydberg constant $$R\text{'} $$ .

Since $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}={\lambda }_{0}\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right) $$ , we have:

<div class="equation" >
 {% raw %}$$\frac{1}{{\lambda }_{\text{obs}}}=\frac{1}{{\lambda }_{0}\left(1+v/c\right)}=\frac{1}{1+v/c}\cdot \frac{1}{{\lambda }_{0}}=\frac{R}{1+v/c}\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $${% endraw %}
</div>
Therefore, the modified Rydberg constant is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$R\text{'}=\frac{R}{1+v/c}=\frac{ 1.097\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1}}{1.050}= 1.045\times 10^{7} {\text{ m}}^{-1} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This demonstrates that Doppler-shifted spectra from receding galaxies follow the same Rydberg formula but with an effective Rydberg constant reduced by the factor $$1/\left(1+v/c\right) $$ . This principle is crucial for measuring cosmological redshifts and determining distances to galaxies. Students could vary this problem by: (1) using different recession velocities, (2) examining other spectral series, (3) considering relativistic velocities requiring the formula $$z=\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}-1 $$ , or (4) investigating how astronomers use multiple spectral lines to confirm redshift measurements. This illustrates how fundamental atomic physics combined with the Doppler effect enables the study of galactic motion and cosmological expansion.
