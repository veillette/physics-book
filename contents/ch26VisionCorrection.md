</div>

The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision
defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to
correct. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) illustrates two common vision defects.
**Nearsightedness**, or **myopia**, is the inability to see distant objects
clearly while close objects are clear. The eye overconverges the nearly parallel
rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More
divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear
image. The distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called
the **far point** of the eye (normally infinity). **Farsightedness**, or **hyperopia**, is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects
may be clear. A farsighted eye does not converge sufficient rays from a close
object to make the rays meet on the retina. Less diverging rays from a distant
object can be converged for a clear image. The distance to the closest object
that can be seen clearly is called the **near point** of the eye (normally 25
cm).

![Part a shows two figures of cross-sectional area of eye depicting myopia. In both the figures, parallel rays coming from an object placed at infinity are converging in front of the retina. Figure on the left shows the lens of the eye too strong and figure on the right illustrates the shape of the eye too long. Part b shows two figures of cross-sectional area of eye depicting hyperopia. In both the figures, rays coming from a close object are shown which are converging at the back of the retina. Figure on the left shows the lens of the eye too weak and figure on the right illustrates the shape of the eye too short.](../resources/Figure_26_02_01.jpg '(a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, producing a blurry image. This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina, producing blurry close vision. This can be caused by insufficient power in the lens or by the eye being too short.')
{: #Figure1}

Since the nearsighted eye over converges light rays, the correction for
nearsightedness is to place a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This
reduces the power of an eye that is too powerful. Another way of thinking about
this is that a diverging spectacle lens produces a case 3 image, which is closer
to the eye than the object (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). To determine the
spectacle power needed for correction, you must know the person’s far point—that
is, you must know the greatest distance at which the person can see clearly.
Then the image produced by a spectacle lens must be at this distance or closer
for the nearsighted person to be able to see it clearly. It is worth noting that
wearing glasses does not change the eye in any way. The eyeglass lens is simply
used to create an image of the object at a distance where the nearsighted person
can see it clearly. Whereas someone not wearing glasses can see clearly _
objects_ that fall between their near point and their far point, someone wearing
glasses can see _images_ that fall between their near point and their far point.

![Two illustrations of cross-sectional view of an eye are shown. In the first figure, a diverging spectacle lens is placed in front of the eye structure. A ray diagram for the diverging lens is also shown. Parallel rays from a distant object, taken as tree, are striking the lens and then diverging. A smaller image of the tree is shown in front of the lens. In the second figure, a ray diagram with respect to the diverging lens within the eye structure is shown. Parallel rays from a distant object are striking the diverging lens, entering the lens of the eye, and converging at retina. This explains the correction of nearsightedness using a diverging lens.](../resources/Figure_26_02_02.jpg 'Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for the overconvergence by the eye. The diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the object, so that the nearsighted person can see it clearly.')

Correcting Nearsightedness
</div>
What power of spectacle lens is needed to correct the vision of a nearsighted person whose far point is 30.0 cm? Assume the spectacle (corrective) lens is held 1.50 cm away from the eye by eyeglass frames.

**Strategy**

You want this nearsighted person to be able to see very distant objects clearly.
That means the spectacle lens must produce an image 30.0 cm from the eye for an
object very far away. An image 30.0 cm from the eye will be 28.5 cm to the left
of the spectacle lens (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). Therefore, we must get
$${d}_{\text{i}}=-28.5 \text{cm} $$ when $${d}_{\text{o}}\approx \infty $$ . The
image distance is negative, because it is on the same side of the spectacle as
the object.

**Solution**

Since $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ are known, the power of the
spectacle lens can be found using $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_ {\text{i}}} $$ as written earlier:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{\infty }+\frac{1}{-0.285 \text{m}}. $$
</div>
Since  $$1 \text{/}\infty = 0 $$ ,
 we obtain:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=0 -3.51/\text{m}=-3.51 \text{D}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The negative power indicates a diverging (or concave) lens, as expected. The
spectacle produces a case 3 image closer to the eye, where the person can see
it. If you examine eyeglasses for nearsighted people, you will find the lenses
are thinnest in the center. Additionally, if you examine a prescription for
eyeglasses for nearsighted people, you will find that the prescribed power is
negative and given in units of diopters.

</div>

Since the farsighted eye under converges light rays, the correction for
farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This
increases the power of an eye that is too weak. Another way of thinking about
this is that a converging spectacle lens produces a case 2 image, which is
farther from the eye than the object (see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). To determine
the spectacle power needed for correction, you must know the person’s near
point—that is, you must know the smallest distance at which the person can see
clearly. Then the image produced by a spectacle lens must be at this distance or
farther for the farsighted person to be able to see it clearly.

![Two illustrations of a cross-sectional view of an eye are shown. In the upper part of the figure, a converging lens is placed in front of the eye structure and a close object before it. A ray diagram showing the rays from the object are striking the lens; converging a bit and entering the eyes; converging again through the eye lens and forming an image at the retina, and another set of rays converge behind the retina. The lower part of the figure shows a virtual image, an object, a converging lens, and the internal structure of an eye. Parallel rays from the object are entering the eyes and converging at a point on the retina. An image larger than the object image is formed behind the object on the same side of the lens.](../resources/Figure_26_02_03.jpg 'Correction of farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the under convergence by the eye. The converging lens produces an image farther from the eye than the object, so that the farsighted person can see it clearly.')

<div class="title">
Correcting Farsightedness
</div>
What power of spectacle lens is needed to allow a farsighted person, whose near point is 1.00 m, to see an object clearly that is 25.0 cm away? Assume the spectacle (corrective) lens is held 1.50 cm away from the eye by eyeglass frames.

**Strategy**

When an object is held 25.0 cm from the person’s eyes, the spectacle lens must
produce an image 1.00 m away (the near point). An image 1.00 m from the eye will
be 98.5 cm to the left of the spectacle lens because the spectacle lens is 1.50
cm from the eye (see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). Therefore, $${d}_{\text{i}}=-98.5 \text{cm} $$ . The image distance is negative, because it is on the same side of
the spectacle as the object. The object is 23.5 cm to the left of the spectacle,
so that $${d}_{\text{o}}=23.5 \text{cm} $$.

**Solution**

Since $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ are known, the power of the
spectacle lens can be found using $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_ {\text{i}}} $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}P& =& \frac{1}{ {d}_{o}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{0.235 \text{m}}+\frac{1}{-0.985 \text{m}}\\ & =& 4.26 D-1.02 \text{D}=3.24 \text{D}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The positive power indicates a converging (convex) lens, as expected. The convex
spectacle produces a case 2 image farther from the eye, where the person can see
it. If you examine eyeglasses of farsighted people, you will find the lenses to
be thickest in the center. In addition, a prescription of eyeglasses for
farsighted people has a prescribed power that is positive.

</div>

Another common vision defect is **astigmatism**, an unevenness or asymmetry in
the focus of the eye. For example, rays passing through a vertical region of the
eye may focus closer than rays passing through a horizontal region, resulting in
the image appearing elongated. This is mostly due to irregularities in the shape
of the cornea but can also be due to lens irregularities or unevenness in the
retina. Because of these irregularities, different parts of the lens system
produce images at different locations. The eye-brain system can compensate for
some of these irregularities, but they generally manifest themselves as less
distinct vision or sharper images along certain axes. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)
shows a chart used to detect astigmatism. Astigmatism can be at least partially
corrected with a spectacle having the opposite irregularity of the eye. If an
eyeglass prescription has a cylindrical correction, it is there to correct
astigmatism. The normal corrections for short- or farsightedness are spherical
corrections, uniform along all axes.

![A circle without border and a cross sign in between. A wheel type structure is shown with parallel lines coming from the border of the circle.](../resources/Figure_26_02_04.jpg 'This chart can detect astigmatism, unevenness in the focus of the eye. Check each of your eyes separately by looking at the center cross (without spectacles if you wear them). If lines along some axes appear darker or clearer than others, you have an astigmatism.')
{: #Figure4}

Contact lenses have advantages over glasses beyond their cosmetic aspects. One
problem with glasses is that as the eye moves, it is not at a fixed distance
from the spectacle lens. Contacts rest on and move with the eye, eliminating
this problem. Because contacts cover a significant portion of the cornea, they
provide superior peripheral vision compared with eyeglasses. Contacts also
correct some corneal astigmatism caused by surface irregularities. The tear
layer between the smooth contact and the cornea fills in the irregularities.
Since the index of refraction of the tear layer and the cornea are very similar,
you now have a regular optical surface in place of an irregular one. If the
curvature of a contact lens is not the same as the cornea (as may be necessary
with some individuals to obtain a comfortable fit), the tear layer between the
contact and cornea acts as a lens. If the tear layer is thinner in the center
than at the edges, it has a negative power, for example. Skilled optometrists
will adjust the power of the contact to compensate.

Other advances in vision correction demonstrate the interconnectedness and value of scientific research. In the 1980s, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou worked on ways to make small but powerful lasers. Up until that time, powerful lasers had to be quite large in order to function properly. Essentially, the intensity of the beam itself would modify the instrument’s ability to function and create too much heat to be practical. Strickland and Mourou used ultrashort laser pulses passed over a grating that modified the beam but retained its power. Chirped pulse amplification, as it became known, has been used to develop most of the highest-powered lasers in the world, but also some of the smallest and most common. Decades after their initial discovery, Strickland and Mourou were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics (with Strickland becoming the third woman to receive the award) partly due to CPA’s pivotal role in the increasingly common practice of laser vision correction—an application neither planned during their initial research.

**Laser vision correction** has progressed rapidly in the last few years. It is
the latest and by far the most successful in a series of procedures that correct
vision by reshaping the cornea. As noted at the beginning of this section, the
cornea accounts for about two-thirds of the power of the eye. Thus, small
adjustments of its curvature have the same effect as putting a lens in front of
the eye. To a reasonable approximation, the power of multiple lenses placed
close together equals the sum of their powers. For example, a concave spectacle
lens (for nearsightedness) having $$P=-3.00 \text{D} $$ has the same effect on
vision as reducing the power of the eye itself by 3.00 D. So to correct the eye
for nearsightedness, the cornea is flattened to reduce its power. Similarly, to
correct for farsightedness, the curvature of the cornea is enhanced to increase
the power of the eye—the same effect as the positive power spectacle lens used
for farsightedness. Laser vision correction uses high intensity electromagnetic
radiation to ablate (to remove material from the surface) and reshape the
corneal surfaces.

Today, the most commonly used laser vision correction procedure is _Laser in
situ Keratomileusis (LASIK)_. The top layer of the cornea is surgically peeled
back and the underlying tissue ablated by multiple bursts of finely controlled
ultraviolet radiation produced by an excimer laser. Lasers are used because they
not only produce well-focused intense light, but they also emit very pure
wavelength electromagnetic radiation that can be controlled more accurately than
mixed wavelength light. The 193 nm wavelength UV commonly used is extremely and
strongly absorbed by corneal tissue, allowing precise evaporation of very thin
layers. A computer controlled program applies more bursts, usually at a rate of
10 per second, to the areas that require deeper removal. Typically a spot less
than 1 mm in diameter and about $$0.3 \text{μm} $$ in thickness is removed by
each burst. Nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism can be corrected
with an accuracy that produces normal distant vision in more than 90% of the
patients, in many cases right away. The corneal flap is replaced; healing takes
place rapidly and is nearly painless. More than 1 million Americans per year
undergo LASIK (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

### Section Summary

- Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects and is
  corrected with a diverging lens to reduce power.
- Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects and is
  corrected with a converging lens to increase power.
- In myopia and hyperopia, the corrective lenses produce images at a distance
  that the person can see clearly—the far point and near point, respectively.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise"  data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem"  markdown="1">
It has become common to replace the cataract-clouded lens of the eye with an internal lens. This intraocular lens can be chosen so that the person has perfect distant vision. Will the person be able to read without glasses? If the person was nearsighted, is the power of the intraocular lens greater or less than the removed lens?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To address this question, we need to understand: (1) how natural lenses accommodate to focus at different distances, (2) what happens when a fixed-power intraocular lens (IOL) replaces the natural lens, and (3) how the original refractive error (nearsightedness) affects IOL power selection.

**Solution**

**Part 1: Will the person be able to read without glasses?**

**No, the person will almost certainly need reading glasses** for the following reasons:

The natural lens of the eye has a remarkable property called **accommodation**—the ability to change its power by changing shape. An **intraocular lens (IOL) is rigid and has fixed power**—it cannot accommodate. When an IOL is selected for perfect distant vision, the person cannot focus on near objects and will need reading glasses.

**Part 2: If the person was nearsighted, is the IOL power greater or less than the removed lens?**

**The IOL power will be LESS than the removed lens power.** A nearsighted person has an eye that is too powerful for its length. To correct to perfect distant vision with an IOL, the IOL must provide less power than the natural lens had, thereby reducing the eye's excessive total power.

**Discussion**

The natural lens can change its power by up to ~14 D in young people through accommodation. A fixed IOL cannot do this, so reading glasses (+2.0 to +3.0 D typically) are needed for near work. Modern alternatives include multifocal IOLs or monovision correction. For myopic eyes, the IOL is weaker than the removed lens because the correction aims to reduce the eye's excessive power to achieve emmetropia (normal vision).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If the cornea is to be reshaped (this can be done surgically or with contact lenses) to correct myopia, should its curvature be made greater or smaller? Explain. Also explain how hyperopia can be corrected.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between corneal curvature and optical power, and how changing curvature affects the eye's focusing ability. The lensmaker's equation shows that power is related to curvature—greater curvature means greater power and vice versa.

**Solution**

**Correcting Myopia (Nearsightedness):**

For myopia correction, **the corneal curvature should be made SMALLER** (flatter). Here's why:

**The myopic problem:**
- Myopic eyes are too powerful—they over-converge light
- Parallel rays from distant objects focus in front of the retina
- The excess power needs to be reduced

**The solution:**
- **Decrease corneal curvature** (flatten the cornea)
- This **reduces corneal power**
- The reduced power allows parallel rays to focus farther back, ideally on the retina

**Mathematical relationship:**

The power of a curved surface is approximately:
<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$$
</div>

where $$R$$ is the radius of curvature, $$n_1$$ is the refractive index of air (~1.00), and $$n_2$$ is the refractive index of the cornea (~1.38).

- **Larger radius** $$R$$ (smaller curvature, flatter) → **smaller power** $$P$$
- **Smaller radius** $$R$$ (greater curvature, more curved) → **larger power** $$P$$

**LASIK for myopia:**
- Removes tissue from the **central cornea**
- Makes the center **flatter** (increases radius of curvature)
- Reduces corneal power by the needed amount
- Typical corrections: -1 D to -10 D (sometimes higher)

**Correcting Hyperopia (Farsightedness):**

For hyperopia correction, **the corneal curvature should be made GREATER** (steeper). Here's why:

**The hyperopic problem:**
- Hyperopic eyes are too weak—they under-converge light
- Rays from near objects cannot be brought to focus on the retina
- Additional power is needed

**The solution:**
- **Increase corneal curvature** (steepen the cornea)
- This **increases corneal power**
- The increased power allows the eye to focus near objects on the retina

**LASIK for hyperopia:**
- Removes tissue from the **peripheral cornea** (in a ring around the center)
- Makes the center **steeper** (decreases radius of curvature centrally)
- Increases corneal power by the needed amount
- Typical corrections: +1 D to +4 D
- More challenging than myopic LASIK due to biomechanical limitations

**Physical Analogy:**

Think of the cornea as a lens:
- **Flatter lens** (like a window pane): weak power, long focal length
- **More curved lens** (like a marble): strong power, short focal length

**Discussion**

The cornea provides approximately 2/3 of the eye's total optical power (~43 D out of ~50 D total). Small changes in corneal curvature can significantly affect focusing:

- **1 D change** requires approximately 6 μm depth of tissue removal centrally
- **Myopia correction**: Central ablation creates a flatter optical zone
- **Hyperopia correction**: Peripheral ablation creates relatively steeper central zone

**Contact lens reshaping (Orthokeratology):**

An alternative to surgery uses specially designed rigid contact lenses worn overnight:
- For myopia: Lenses gently flatten the central cornea
- For hyperopia: Lenses steepen the central cornea
- Effects are temporary and reversible
- Must wear lenses nightly to maintain correction

**Practical considerations:**

**Myopic LASIK advantages:**
- More tissue available for removal
- More predictable outcomes
- Wider range of corrections possible
- Central ablation is mechanically stable

**Hyperopic LASIK challenges:**
- Peripheral ablation can cause regression (cornea tends to return toward original shape)
- Smaller treatment zone
- More limited correction range
- More complex biomechanical response

**Physical limits:**

The cornea cannot be reshaped indefinitely:
- Must maintain minimum thickness (~250 μm typically) for structural integrity
- Excessive flattening (myopia overcorrection) can cause irregular astigmatism
- Excessive steepening (hyperopia overcorrection) is biomechanically unstable
- These limits constrain the maximum correction achievable

The key principle: **Curvature and power are directly related**—decrease curvature to decrease power (myopia correction), increase curvature to increase power (hyperopia correction). This fundamental relationship applies whether the reshaping is achieved surgically (LASIK, PRK), through implants (intracorneal rings), or non-surgically (orthokeratology lenses).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If there is a fixed percent uncertainty in LASIK reshaping of the cornea, why would you expect those people with the greatest correction to have a poorer chance of normal distant vision after the procedure?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This question involves understanding error propagation and how a fixed percentage uncertainty translates to larger absolute errors when applied to larger corrections. We need to consider how measurement and ablation uncertainties affect final refractive outcomes.

**Solution**

People requiring the greatest correction have a poorer chance of achieving normal distant vision because **a fixed percent uncertainty produces larger absolute errors for larger corrections**.

**Mathematical Analysis:**

Suppose LASIK has a **fixed ±2% uncertainty** in the amount of tissue removed (representative of real-world precision).

**Case 1: Small correction** (-2.0 D myopia)
- Target correction: -2.0 D
- Uncertainty: ±2% of 2.0 D = ±0.04 D
- Possible outcome range: -1.96 D to -2.04 D
- **Absolute error: ±0.04 D** (excellent outcome—within normal vision range)

**Case 2: Large correction** (-10.0 D myopia)
- Target correction: -10.0 D
- Uncertainty: ±2% of 10.0 D = ±0.20 D
- Possible outcome range: -9.80 D to -10.20 D
- **Absolute error: ±0.20 D** (noticeable residual refractive error)

**The absolute error is 5 times larger** for the -10 D correction compared to the -2 D correction, even though the percentage uncertainty is identical.

**Physical Interpretation:**

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Absolute error} = (\text{Percent uncertainty}) \times (\text{Target correction})$$
</div>

As the target correction increases, the absolute error increases proportionally. Since optical performance depends on **absolute refractive error** (not percent error), larger corrections face larger absolute deviations from perfect vision.

**What constitutes "normal distant vision"?**

- Clinically, normal vision is typically defined as within **±0.50 D** of target
- Many consider **±0.25 D** as excellent results
- Beyond ±0.50 D, patients often notice blur and may need corrective lenses

With ±2% uncertainty:
- **-2 D correction:** ±0.04 D error → always achieves normal vision
- **-5 D correction:** ±0.10 D error → usually achieves normal vision
- **-10 D correction:** ±0.20 D error → sometimes achieves normal vision
- **-15 D correction:** ±0.30 D error → often has residual error

**Sources of LASIK Uncertainty:**

1. **Measurement errors:**
   - Pre-operative refraction measurement: ±0.25 D typical
   - Corneal topography: small measurement variations
   - Eye length measurement: affects power calculations

2. **Ablation uncertainties:**
   - Laser calibration: ±1-2% variation in ablation depth
   - Corneal hydration state: affects tissue removal rate
   - Environmental factors: humidity, temperature affect ablation

3. **Biomechanical response:**
   - Wound healing variability increases with ablation depth
   - Deeper ablations (large corrections) → more healing response
   - Healing can cause regression (return toward original error)

4. **Tissue removal accumulation:**
   - For -10 D: ~120 μm of tissue removed centrally
   - For -2 D: ~24 μm of tissue removed centrally
   - Larger removals accumulate more ablation uncertainty

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates a fundamental principle in precision engineering and medicine: **percentage errors become increasingly significant in absolute terms as the magnitude of the operation increases**.

**Real-world LASIK statistics support this:**

Published studies show:
- **Low myopia** (-1 to -3 D): >95% achieve 20/20 vision or better
- **Moderate myopia** (-3 to -6 D): ~85-90% achieve 20/20 or better
- **High myopia** (-6 to -10 D): ~70-80% achieve 20/20 or better
- **Extreme myopia** (>-10 D): ~50-60% achieve 20/20 or better

**Additional factors for high corrections:**

1. **Biomechanical instability:** Deep ablations weaken corneal structure
2. **Regression:** Higher corrections show more tendency to regress over time
3. **Irregular astigmatism:** More common with deep ablations
4. **Reduced tissue reserve:** Less tissue available for enhancements
5. **Peripheral visual quality:** Greater impact on contrast sensitivity and night vision

**Clinical implications:**

For high myopia (>-8 D), alternatives may be preferable:
- **Phakic IOLs:** Implantable contact lens (doesn't remove corneal tissue)
- **Refractive lens exchange:** Replace natural lens with IOL
- **Two-stage LASIK:** Initial partial correction, later enhancement
- **Conservative target:** Aim for slight under-correction to stay within safe limits

**Analogy:**

Consider measuring and cutting wood:
- If your saw has ±2% accuracy:
  - Cutting a 10 cm board: ±2 mm error (acceptable for many uses)
  - Cutting a 100 cm board: ±20 mm error (significant and noticeable)
- The percentage is the same, but the absolute error scales with the size

Similarly in LASIK:
- Same percentage precision
- Larger corrections = larger absolute errors
- Larger absolute errors = lower probability of perfect outcome

This explains why LASIK candidates with high refractive errors are counseled about:
- Lower probability of achieving 20/20 uncorrected vision
- Higher chance of needing glasses for some activities
- Greater possibility of requiring enhancement procedures
- Importance of having realistic expectations

The relationship between percent uncertainty and absolute error is a fundamental constraint in any precision process, from manufacturing to medicine. Understanding this helps patients make informed decisions about refractive surgery based on their specific correction needs.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A person with presbyopia has lost some or all of the ability to accommodate the power of the eye. If such a person's distant vision is corrected with LASIK, will she still need reading glasses? Explain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To answer this question, we must distinguish between two separate optical functions of the eye: (1) the static refractive power that determines distant vision, and (2) the dynamic accommodation ability that allows near vision. LASIK corrects only one of these.

**Solution**

**Yes, a person with presbyopia will still need reading glasses after LASIK correction for distant vision.**

Here's why:

**Understanding Presbyopia:**

Presbyopia is the **loss of accommodation**—the eye's ability to change its optical power to focus on near objects. It results from:
- Hardening of the crystalline lens with age
- Weakening of the ciliary muscles
- Reduced elasticity of the lens capsule
- Typically begins around age 40-45 and progresses with age

**What LASIK Does:**

LASIK reshapes the cornea to correct the eye's **static refractive error**:
- For myopia: flattens the cornea to reduce power
- For hyperopia: steepens the cornea to increase power
- For astigmatism: reshapes to create uniform curvature

**What LASIK Does NOT Do:**

LASIK **does not restore accommodation**. It cannot:
- Make the crystalline lens more flexible
- Strengthen the ciliary muscles
- Change the eye's ability to alter its power dynamically
- Provide different powers for different viewing distances

**The Two-Part Vision System:**

Think of vision as requiring two independent capabilities:

1. **Static refraction** (corrected by LASIK):
   - The fixed optical power of the eye when relaxed
   - Determines whether distant objects focus on the retina
   - Problems: myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism

2. **Dynamic accommodation** (NOT corrected by LASIK):
   - The ability to increase power for near objects
   - Provides additional +2 to +3 D for reading
   - Problem: presbyopia (loss of this ability)

**Numerical Example:**

Consider a 50-year-old with -3.0 D myopia and presbyopia:

**Before LASIK:**
- Relaxed eye power: 53 D (too strong for distance)
- Accommodation ability: ~1 D (reduced due to presbyopia)
- **Distance vision:** Blurry (needs -3 D glasses)
- **Near vision at 40 cm:** Requires +2.5 D additional power
  - Can accommodate only +1 D
  - **Still needs +1.5 D reading glasses** (even with myopia helping near vision!)

**After LASIK (correcting the -3 D myopia):**
- Relaxed eye power: ~50 D (corrected for distance)
- Accommodation ability: ~1 D (unchanged—presbyopia persists)
- **Distance vision:** Clear (no glasses needed!)
- **Near vision at 40 cm:** Requires +2.5 D additional power
  - Can accommodate only +1 D
  - **Needs +2.5 D reading glasses** (actually needs MORE correction than before)

**Why Reading Glasses Are MORE Necessary After LASIK:**

Paradoxically, correcting myopia can make presbyopia more noticeable:
- **Myopic people** naturally have good near vision (even without accommodation)
- Many remove their distance glasses to read
- After LASIK corrects distant vision, this "built-in reading correction" is lost
- The full presbyopic deficit becomes apparent

**Solutions for Presbyopia with LASIK:**

Several approaches address both issues:

**1. Monovision LASIK:**
- One eye corrected for distance (typically dominant eye)
- Other eye left slightly myopic (-1.25 to -1.75 D) for near vision
- Brain adapts to use appropriate eye for each distance
- About 70-80% of people adapt successfully
- Trade-off: reduced depth perception, slightly compromised vision at each distance

**2. Blended Vision (Modified Monovision):**
- Dominant eye: fully corrected for distance
- Non-dominant eye: corrected for intermediate distance
- Creates overlap in functional range
- Better depth perception than traditional monovision

**3. Multifocal LASIK:**
- Experimental technique creating different zones on cornea
- Some zones for distance, some for near
- Similar concept to multifocal contact lenses or IOLs
- Mixed success; can cause halos and reduced contrast

**4. PresbyLASIK:**
- Creates aspherical corneal shape with increased depth of focus
- Non-dominant eye treated to enhance near vision
- Still evolving technology

**5. Combine LASIK with Reading Glasses:**
- LASIK corrects distance vision
- Use reading glasses (+1.50 to +2.50 D) for near tasks
- Most straightforward and reliable approach
- No compromise in visual quality

**Discussion**

It's crucial to understand that **refractive error and accommodation are independent optical properties:**

**Refractive Error (Static):**
- Due to mismatch between eye's power and length
- Present at all ages
- Correctable with glasses, contacts, or refractive surgery
- LASIK addresses this problem

**Presbyopia (Dynamic):**
- Due to loss of lens flexibility
- Age-related, universal (everyone gets it eventually)
- Currently cannot be permanently corrected by reshaping cornea
- LASIK does NOT address this problem

**Patient Education Importance:**

Many patients mistakenly believe LASIK will eliminate all need for glasses. It's essential they understand:
- LASIK corrects distance vision (static refraction)
- Presbyopia is a separate condition affecting near vision
- Reading glasses will still be needed after age 40-45
- LASIK doesn't accelerate or prevent presbyopia

**The Biology Constraint:**

Presbyopia is a biological aging process affecting the lens, not an optical problem with the cornea:
- The lens continues to grow throughout life, adding layers like an onion
- This makes it increasingly rigid
- The ciliary muscles also weaken with age
- Reshaping the cornea cannot reverse these biological changes

**Future Possibilities:**

Research is ongoing into:
- **Accommodating corneal inlays:** Small implants that change corneal shape with accommodation effort
- **Lens replacement:** Removing the presbyopic lens and replacing with an accommodating IOL
- **Pharmacological approaches:** Drugs to soften the lens
- **Laser lens treatments:** Using femtosecond lasers to soften the lens

Currently, none of these has proven as reliable as simply using reading glasses or multifocal lenses for near tasks.

**Conclusion:**

A person with presbyopia who undergoes LASIK to correct distant vision will definitely still need reading glasses because LASIK corrects the eye's static refractive error (enabling clear distant vision) but does not restore the dynamic accommodation ability (necessary for near vision). The presbyopia—the underlying loss of accommodation—remains unchanged by corneal reshaping. This is an important distinction for patient counseling and managing expectations for refractive surgery in the presbyopic population.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the far point of a person whose eyes have a relaxed power of 50.5 D?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The far point is the maximum distance at which a person can see clearly with relaxed (un-accommodated) eyes. For a relaxed eye, we use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ where $$P = 50.5$$ D is the relaxed power and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm is the lens-to-retina distance. Solving for $$d_o$$ gives the far point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Relaxed power: $$P = 50.5 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P - \frac{1}{d_i} = 50.5 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 50.5 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 0.5 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{0.5 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 2.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The person's far point is 2.00 m. This indicates mild myopia (nearsightedness) since the relaxed power of 50.5 D is slightly greater than the normal 50.0 D. The excess 0.5 D causes the eye to focus light from distant objects in front of the retina, resulting in blurry distant vision.

This person can see clearly only up to 2.00 meters away when their eyes are relaxed. Beyond this distance, objects appear blurry. For normal distant vision (far point at infinity), this person would need a -0.5 D corrective lens to reduce the eye's excessive power. While 2.00 m myopia is relatively mild, it would still cause difficulties with activities like driving, watching movies in theaters, or reading a classroom whiteboard from the back of a room. Many people with this level of myopia choose to wear glasses for distance activities but can function without them for everyday tasks.

What is the near point of a person whose eyes have an accommodated power of 53.5 D?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The near point is the closest distance at which a person can see clearly with fully accommodated vision. Using the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$, where $$P = 53.5$$ D is the accommodated power and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm (lens-to-retina distance), we can solve for the object distance $$d_o$$, which is the near point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Accommodated power: $$P = 53.5 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P - \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 53.5 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 53.5 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 3.5 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{3.5 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.286 \text{ m} = 28.6 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The near point of this person is 28.6 cm, which is slightly farther than the normal near point of 25 cm. This indicates a mild degree of presbyopia or early farsightedness. The accommodated power of 53.5 D represents only a 3.5 D increase over the relaxed power of 50.0 D (for distant vision), compared to the normal 4.0 D accommodation ability. This 12.5% reduction in accommodation power is typical for someone in their 40s or early 50s. While this person can still read without glasses, they may find it more comfortable to hold reading material slightly farther away than the standard 25 cm reading distance.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) A laser vision correction reshaping the cornea of a myopic patient reduces the power of his eye by 9.00 D, with a  $$± 5.0%  $$
 uncertainty in the final correction. What is the range of diopters for spectacle lenses that this person might need after LASIK procedure? (b) Was the person nearsighted or farsighted before the procedure? How do you know?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), a ±5.0% uncertainty in the 9.00 D correction means the actual correction could vary by ±5.0% of 9.00 D. If the target is perfect vision (no glasses needed), the uncertainty determines the range of corrective lenses potentially needed. For part (b), we identify the vision defect based on whether power was reduced or increased.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Power reduction: $$\Delta P = 9.00 \text{ D}$$
- Uncertainty: $$±5.0\%$$

**(a)** Calculate the uncertainty in diopters:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Uncertainty} = 0.050 \times 9.00 \text{ D} = 0.45 \text{ D}$$
</div>

The range of possible corrections is $$9.00 \text{ D} ± 0.45 \text{ D}$$, meaning:
- Best case: $$9.00 + 0.45 = 9.45 \text{ D}$$ reduction (slight over-correction)
- Worst case: $$9.00 - 0.45 = 8.55 \text{ D}$$ reduction (slight under-correction)

If the goal was zero correction needed:
- Over-correction by 0.45 D would require $$+0.45 \text{ D}$$ (convex) glasses
- Under-correction by 0.45 D would require $$-0.45 \text{ D}$$ (concave) glasses

Therefore, the range is $$±0.45 \text{ D}$$.

**(b)** The person was **nearsighted (myopic)** before the procedure. We know this because:
1. The problem states the patient is myopic
2. The power was *reduced* by 9.00 D
3. Myopia results from excessive eye power, so reducing power corrects nearsightedness

**Discussion**

Part (a): A ±0.45 D uncertainty range is relatively small and clinically acceptable. Most people with ±0.45 D residual error would have quite functional vision. For comparison:
- +0.45 D: Slight difficulty with close reading (mild hyperopia)
- -0.45 D: Slight difficulty with distant objects (mild myopia)

Many patients in this range choose not to wear glasses for everyday activities, though they might use them for specific tasks like night driving or extended reading.

Part (b): The 9.00 D correction is substantial, indicating significant myopia before surgery. This person likely had a far point of about 11 cm (calculation: $$d_o = 1/(9.00 + 50.0 - 50.0) \approx 0.11 \text{ m}$$), meaning they could see clearly only up to about 11 cm without glasses—severely limiting their activities without correction. The LASIK procedure dramatically improved their quality of life by enabling normal distant vision, even with the small uncertainty.

This problem illustrates why LASIK uncertainty specifications are important. A 5% uncertainty might seem small, but for large corrections like 9.00 D, it translates to nearly half a diopter of potential residual error. This is why careful pre-operative assessment and conservative treatment planning are essential.

In a LASIK vision correction, the power of a patient's eye is increased by 3.00 D. Assuming this produces normal close vision, what was the patient's near point before the procedure?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Normal close vision corresponds to a near point of 25.0 cm, which requires an accommodated power of 54.0 D (as calculated in the text examples). After the LASIK procedure that increases eye power by 3.00 D, the patient achieves this normal near point. Before the procedure, the patient's accommodated power was 3.00 D less. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ to find the original near point with the reduced power.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Power increase from LASIK: $$\Delta P = 3.00 \text{ D}$$
- Normal accommodated power: $$P_{\text{after}} = 54.0 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

The patient's accommodated power before the procedure:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{before}} = P_{\text{after}} - \Delta P = 54.0 \text{ D} - 3.00 \text{ D} = 51.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Using the power equation to find the original near point:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{before}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P_{\text{before}} - \frac{1}{d_i} = 51.0 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 51.0 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 1.0 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Before the LASIK procedure, the patient's near point was 1.0 m (100 cm), indicating significant hyperopia (farsightedness). This person could not see objects clearly closer than one meter, making reading and other close work impossible without corrective lenses. The 3.00 D power increase from LASIK surgery brought the near point from 100 cm to the normal 25 cm, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life.

This large near point distance explains why the patient needed LASIK. With only 1.0 D of accommodation power before surgery (compared to the normal 4.0 D), this person likely suffered from either severe presbyopia (age-related loss of accommodation) or congenital hyperopia. After surgery, with their total accommodated power now at 54.0 D, they can read normally without glasses. This demonstrates how LASIK can correct not just distant vision problems (myopia) but also near vision problems (hyperopia).

What was the previous far point of a patient who had laser vision correction that reduced the power of her eye by 7.00 D, producing normal distant vision for her?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

After laser vision correction that produced normal distant vision, the patient's relaxed eye power is 50.0 D (normal for viewing at infinity). Before the procedure, the power was 7.00 D higher. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with the pre-procedure power to find the original far point $$d_o$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Power reduction: $$\Delta P = 7.00 \text{ D}$$
- Post-procedure relaxed power (normal): $$P_{\text{after}} = 50.0 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Calculate the pre-procedure relaxed power:

<div class="equation">

<div class="equation">

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{7.00 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.143 \text{ m} = 14.3 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Before laser vision correction, the patient's far point was 0.143 m (14.3 cm), indicating severe myopia. This person could see clearly only up to about 14 cm—roughly the distance from their nose to their outstretched hand. Beyond this short distance, everything appeared increasingly blurry. This level of myopia would have been extremely debilitating without corrective lenses.

The 7.00 D power reduction through LASIK surgery transformed this patient's life dramatically. Activities that most people take for granted—recognizing faces across a room, reading street signs, watching television, driving—would have been impossible without thick corrective glasses or contact lenses before surgery.

For comparison:
- Normal relaxed eye power: 50.0 D
- Patient's pre-LASIK power: 57.0 D (14% higher than normal)
- Far point: 14.3 cm instead of infinity

After surgery, with normal 50.0 D power, the patient can see clearly to infinity. This is equivalent to what would have been achieved with -7.00 D spectacle lenses, but without the inconvenience, optical distortions, weight, and aesthetic concerns of strong corrective glasses. The LASIK procedure permanently reshaped the cornea to reduce its optical power by flattening its curvature.

A severely myopic patient has a far point of 5.00 cm. By how many diopters should the power of his eye be reduced in laser vision correction to obtain normal distant vision for him?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For normal distant vision, the relaxed eye should have a power of 50.0 D (corresponding to a far point at infinity). The patient's current relaxed power can be calculated from their far point of 5.00 cm using $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$. The difference between the current power and the normal power gives the required power reduction.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Current far point: $$d_o = 5.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Calculate the current relaxed power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{current}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.0500 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{current}} = 20.0 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 70.0 \text{ D}$$

The required power reduction:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta P = P_{\text{current}} - P_{\text{normal}} = 70.0 \text{ D} - 50.0 \text{ D} = 20.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The patient's eye power must be reduced by 20.0 D to achieve normal distant vision. This is a very large correction, reflecting the severity of the myopia—the patient can only see clearly up to 5.00 cm away, which is extremely close. With a far point this close, the patient would be unable to perform most daily tasks without corrective lenses.

A 20.0 D power reduction is at the upper limit of what LASIK can typically achieve safely. Most LASIK procedures correct between -1.00 D to -12.00 D of myopia. A 20.0 D correction would require removing a significant amount of corneal tissue, potentially compromising corneal strength and stability. For such severe myopia, alternative procedures like phakic intraocular lenses (implantable lenses placed inside the eye) might be more appropriate. This problem illustrates the limitations of laser vision correction and why careful patient screening is essential before surgery.

A student's eyes, while reading the blackboard, have a power of 51.0 D. How far is the board from his eyes?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$P = 51.0$$ D and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm to solve for the object distance $$d_o$$, which is the distance from the student's eyes to the blackboard.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Eye power: $$P = 51.0 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P - \frac{1}{d_i} = 51.0 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 51.0 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 1.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The blackboard is 1.00 m from the student's eyes. The eye power of 51.0 D represents 1.0 D of accommodation beyond the relaxed power of 50.0 D (for distant vision). This is a comfortable level of accommodation—well within the typical 4.0 D range for young adults.

A 1.00 m viewing distance is reasonable for a blackboard, suggesting the student is sitting in the front or middle rows of the classroom. For comparison:
- Relaxed eye (distant vision): 50.0 D, viewing at infinity
- Moderate accommodation (1.00 m): 51.0 D, requires 1.0 D accommodation
- Normal near point (25 cm): 54.0 D, requires 4.0 D accommodation

The modest 1.0 D accommodation at 1.00 m means the student can comfortably read the blackboard for extended periods without significant eye strain. If the student were sitting farther back (say 3-5 meters), their eyes would be nearly completely relaxed (close to 50.0 D), requiring even less accommodation. This is one reason why educators sometimes recommend seating students with vision concerns farther from the board rather than closer—it reduces the accommodation demand and associated eye fatigue during long lectures.

The power of a physician's eyes is 53.0 D while examining a patient. How far from her eyes is the feature being examined?

**Strategy**

Using the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$, where $$P = 53.0$$ D and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm, we can solve for the object distance $$d_o$$, which represents how far the examined feature is from the physician's eyes.

 $$d_o = \frac{1}{3.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.333 \text{ m} = 33.3 \text{ cm}$$

**Discussion**

The feature being examined is 33.3 cm from the physician's eyes. This is a comfortable working distance for close examination, slightly farther than the standard near point of 25 cm. The physician is using an accommodated power of 53.0 D, which represents 3.0 D of accommodation beyond the relaxed power of 50.0 D.

This distance is typical for medical examinations where the physician needs to look closely at a patient's features (such as examining eyes, ears, throat, or skin lesions) but still maintain a comfortable working distance. It's close enough to see fine details but far enough to avoid discomfort for both patient and physician. The 3.0 D of accommodation required is well within the normal accommodation range, so the physician can maintain this examination distance for extended periods without significant eye strain.

A young woman with normal distant vision has a 10.0% ability to accommodate (that is, increase) the power of her eyes. What is the closest object she can see clearly?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Normal distant vision corresponds to a relaxed eye power of 50.0 D. A 10.0% accommodation ability means the accommodated power is 1.10 times the relaxed power. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with the accommodated power to find the near point $$d_o$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Relaxed power (normal): $$P_{\text{relaxed}} = 50.0 \text{ D}$$
- Accommodation ability: 10.0%
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

 $$d_o = \frac{1}{5.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.200 \text{ m} = 20.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The closest object this woman can see clearly is at 20.0 cm (her near point). Her 10.0% accommodation ability translates to 5.0 D of accommodation (from 50.0 D relaxed to 55.0 D accommodated), which is slightly better than the typical 4.0 D for young adults with a 25 cm near point.

For comparison:
- Normal near point: 25 cm (requires 4.0 D accommodation)
- This woman's near point: 20 cm (requires 5.0 D accommodation)

The 20.0 cm near point indicates slightly better than average near vision for her age. This enhanced accommodation could be due to:
1. Youth (younger individuals typically have greater accommodation)
2. Good eye health and flexibility of the lens
3. Possibly some degree of natural myopia that aids close vision

However, a 20 cm near point is quite close—closer than most people hold reading material (typically 25-40 cm). While she can focus at this distance, she might find it uncomfortable for extended reading due to the effort required to maintain maximum accommodation. Most people prefer to read at or slightly beyond their near point where less accommodation is needed, reducing eye strain.

As she ages, this accommodation ability will gradually decrease (presbyopia), and her near point will move farther away. By age 40-50, her near point might be 40-50 cm or more, at which point she would likely need reading glasses.

The far point of a myopic administrator is 50.0 cm. (a) What is the relaxed power of their eyes? (b) If they have the normal 8.00% ability to accommodate, what is the closest object they can see clearly?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with the far point distance (50.0 cm) as $$d_o$$ to find the relaxed power. For part (b), an 8.00% accommodation ability means the accommodated power is 1.08 times the relaxed power. We then use the power equation to find the near point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: $$d_o = 50.0 \text{ cm} = 0.500 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$
- Accommodation ability: 8.00%

**(a)** Calculate the relaxed power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{relaxed}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.500 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{relaxed}} = 2.00 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 52.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate the accommodated power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{accommodated}} = 1.08 \times P_{\text{relaxed}} = 1.08 \times 52.0 \text{ D} = 56.2 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Find the near point using the accommodated power:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P_{\text{accommodated}} - \frac{1}{d_i} = 56.2 \text{ D} - 50.0 \text{ D} = 6.2 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{6.2 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.161 \text{ m} = 16.1 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The relaxed power of 52.0 D is higher than the normal 50.0 D, confirming this person is myopic (nearsighted). The excess 2.0 D of power causes distant objects beyond 50.0 cm to appear blurry.

Part (b): The near point of 16.1 cm is actually closer than the normal 25 cm. This is an interesting benefit of mild myopia—myopic people can see close objects more clearly than people with normal vision. The administrator can read comfortably at 16.1 cm, which is advantageous for detailed close work.

This problem illustrates that myopia has a "silver lining": while distant vision is compromised, near vision is enhanced. This is why some older people with presbyopia may deliberately under-correct their myopia or use reading glasses weaker than needed—they want to preserve their advantage in close-up tasks. However, for most daily activities requiring both near and distant vision, corrective lenses for myopia are still beneficial. The administrator would need -2.00 D corrective lenses to see distant objects clearly.

A very myopic man has a far point of 20.0 cm. What power contact lens (when on the eye) will correct his distant vision?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For normal distant vision, we want the corrected eye to focus objects at infinity onto the retina. The contact lens must create a virtual image at the man's far point (20.0 cm) when viewing distant objects. Since the contact lens sits directly on the eye, we use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$d_o = \infty$$ (distant object) and $$d_i = -20.0$$ cm (virtual image at far point).

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: 20.0 cm = 0.200 m
- Object distance: $$d_o = \infty$$ (distant objects)
- Image distance: $$d_i = -0.200 \text{ m}$$ (negative for virtual image)

Using the power equation for the contact lens:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-0.200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0 - 5.00 \text{ m}^{-1} = -5.00 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required contact lens power is -5.00 D (diverging lens). This negative power is characteristic of myopia correction. The contact lens diverges light rays before they enter the eye, effectively reducing the combined optical power of the lens-eye system to achieve normal distant vision.

Physical interpretation:
- Without correction: The man's eye power of 55.0 D (calculated from $$P = 1/0.20 + 1/0.02 = 55.0$$ D) is too strong, focusing distant objects 20 cm in front of the retina
- With -5.00 D contact: Combined power becomes $$55.0 - 5.00 = 50.0$$ D, the normal relaxed power for distant vision
- Result: Distant objects now focus correctly on the retina

This is a moderate to strong myopia correction. For comparison:
- Mild myopia: -0.25 to -3.00 D
- Moderate myopia: -3.00 to -6.00 D (this patient)
- High myopia: -6.00 D and above

With -5.00 D lenses, the man would see distant objects clearly. However, this correction might make near vision slightly more challenging, as his natural advantage for close work (short far point) is eliminated. Some myopic individuals choose to under-correct slightly for this reason, using -4.50 D lenses for distance while retaining some near vision advantage.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a myopic man with a far point of 20.0 cm who needed a -5.00 D contact lens. For eyeglasses held 1.50 cm from the eye, we must account for this separation. The spectacle lens must create an image at the far point (20.0 cm from the eye, or 18.5 cm from the lens) when viewing distant objects. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$d_o = \infty$$ and $$d_i = -18.5$$ cm.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point from eye: 20.0 cm
- Spectacle distance from eye: 1.50 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(20.0 - 1.50) = -18.5 \text{ cm} = -0.185 \text{ m}$$
- Object distance: $$d_o = \infty$$ (distant objects)

The negative image distance indicates the image is on the same side as the object (virtual image).

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-0.185 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0 - 5.41 \text{ m}^{-1} = -5.41 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is -5.41 D, which is slightly more negative than the -5.00 D contact lens. This difference arises because the spectacle lens is 1.50 cm farther from the eye's optical system. The farther the corrective lens is from the eye, the stronger it must be to create an image at the same location.

This 0.41 D difference may seem small, but it's clinically significant. This is why contact lens and eyeglass prescriptions differ for the same person—the prescription must account for the vertex distance (distance from the lens to the cornea). For mild prescriptions, this difference is negligible, but for strong prescriptions like this one, it becomes important. An optometrist must adjust the prescription when converting between contacts and glasses, typically making spectacles slightly stronger (more negative for myopia) than contact lenses.

A myopic person sees that her contact lens prescription is  $$-4.00 \text{D} $$ .
 What is her far point?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A contact lens prescription of -4.00 D means the lens creates a virtual image at the person's far point when viewing distant objects. Using $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$P = -4.00$$ D and $$d_o = \infty$$, we solve for $$d_i$$, which is the negative of the far point distance.

The negative sign indicates a virtual image. The far point is the magnitude:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Far point} = 25.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This person's far point is 25.0 cm, which is quite close and indicates moderate myopia. Without corrective lenses, she can see clearly only up to 25 cm (about 10 inches)—roughly the distance of holding a book for reading. Everything beyond this distance appears increasingly blurry.

The -4.00 D contact lens prescription is a common moderate myopia correction. This person's uncorrected eye has a relaxed power of approximately 54.0 D (calculated from $$P = 1/0.25 + 1/0.02 = 54.0$$ D), which is 4.00 D stronger than the normal 50.0 D for distant vision.

Interesting observations:
- Her far point (25 cm) coincidentally equals the normal near point
- Without glasses, she has a natural advantage for close work
- With -4.00 D contacts, distant vision becomes normal, but she may need reading glasses earlier in life due to presbyopia

The -4.00 D lenses work by diverging incoming parallel light rays, making them appear to come from 25 cm away—her far point. Her eye can then focus these apparently nearby rays onto the retina, achieving clear distant vision. This is a moderate prescription that would likely require full-time wear for activities like driving, watching television, or seeing across a room, but she might not need them for reading or computer work.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a myopic person with a -4.00 D contact lens prescription and a far point of 25.0 cm. For eyeglasses held 1.75 cm from the eyes, the spectacle lens must create an image at the far point (25.0 cm from the eye, or 23.25 cm from the lens) when viewing distant objects. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$d_o = \infty$$ and $$d_i = -23.25$$ cm.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point from eye: 25.0 cm
- Spectacle distance from eye: 1.75 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(25.0 - 1.75) = -23.25 \text{ cm} = -0.2325 \text{ m}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0 - 4.30 \text{ m}^{-1} = -4.30 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is -4.30 D, compared to the -4.00 D contact lens. The spectacle lens must be 0.30 D stronger (more negative) because it sits 1.75 cm from the eye. This vertex distance effect is important for accurate vision correction.

For this moderate myopia prescription, the vertex distance correction is about 7.5% of the contact lens power. This difference becomes more pronounced with stronger prescriptions. An optometrist typically uses the formula $$P_{\text{spectacle}} = \frac{P_{\text{contact}}}{1 - d \cdot P_{\text{contact}}}$$ where $$d$$ is the vertex distance, to accurately convert between contact and spectacle prescriptions.

The fact that spectacle lenses need to be stronger than contact lenses for myopia correction is one reason why some people prefer contacts—they provide correction with less optical power, which can reduce optical distortions and weight of the lenses. However, for mild to moderate myopia like this case, the difference is small enough that either option provides excellent vision correction.

The contact lens prescription for a mildly farsighted person is 0.750 D, and the person has a near point of 29.0 cm. What is the power of the tear layer between the cornea and the lens if the correction is ideal, taking the tear layer into account?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For ideal correction, viewing an object at the normal near point (25.0 cm) should produce an image at the person's actual near point (29.0 cm). The total optical power is the sum of three components: the contact lens (+0.750 D), the tear layer (unknown), and the eye's power. We calculate the required total power and subtract the known components to find the tear layer power.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Contact lens power: $$P_{\text{lens}} = +0.750 \text{ D}$$
- Person's actual near point: 29.0 cm = 0.290 m
- Normal near point (object): 25.0 cm = 0.250 m

For ideal correction at the normal near point, the contact-tear-eye system must create an image at the person's actual near point when the object is at 25.0 cm.

The total power needed (contact + tear + eye) to view at 25.0 cm:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.250 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{total}} = 4.00 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 54.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

The eye's accommodated power when viewing at 29.0 cm (actual near point):

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{eye}} = \frac{1}{0.290 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}} = 3.448 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 53.448 \text{ D}$$
</div>

The tear layer power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{tear}} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{lens}} - P_{\text{eye}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{tear}} = 54.0 \text{ D} - 0.750 \text{ D} - 53.448 \text{ D} = -0.198 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tear layer has a power of -0.198 D (diverging). This negative power arises because the contact lens doesn't perfectly match the curvature of the cornea. The tear layer fills the gap between the contact lens and cornea, and if this layer is thicker at the edges than in the center (which is common), it acts as a weak diverging lens.

Physical interpretation:
- The +0.750 D contact lens provides most of the correction for farsightedness
- The -0.198 D tear layer slightly reduces this correction
- The net effect (+0.750 - 0.198 = +0.552 D) combined with the eye's power gives ideal near vision at 25 cm

This problem illustrates an important practical consideration in contact lens fitting. Optometrists must account for the tear layer when prescribing contact lenses. If they ignored the tear layer effect, they would prescribe +0.750 D, but the actual correction would be only +0.552 D, resulting in under-correction.

The tear layer power depends on:
1. The difference in curvature between the contact lens and cornea
2. The thickness profile of the tear layer
3. The refractive indices of the tear fluid and contact material

For this patient, the optometrist successfully prescribed +0.750 D knowing the tear layer would contribute -0.198 D, resulting in the ideal +0.552 D net correction needed.

A nearsighted man cannot see objects clearly beyond 20 cm from his eyes. How close must he stand to a mirror in order to see what he is doing when he shaves?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The man's far point is 20 cm, meaning he can see clearly only up to this distance. When looking in a mirror, he sees an image of his face that appears to be behind the mirror at a distance equal to his distance from the mirror. For clear vision, the total optical path (from his eyes to the mirror and back to the apparent image location) must be within his far point of 20 cm. If he stands at distance $$d$$ from the mirror, the image appears at distance $$d$$ behind the mirror, making the total distance $$2d$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: 20 cm
- Total optical distance to image: $$2d$$ (where $$d$$ is distance to mirror)

For clear vision, the image distance must equal the far point:

<div class="equation">
 $$2d = 20 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d = 10 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The man must stand 10 cm from the mirror to see himself clearly while shaving. At this distance, the image of his face appears 10 cm behind the mirror surface, making the total optical path 20 cm—exactly his far point.

This is quite close to the mirror, which would be awkward and impractical for shaving. The mirror would likely fog from his breath, and maneuvering a razor would be difficult at such close range. This problem illustrates why uncorrected myopia significantly impacts daily activities. With -5.00 D corrective lenses (as calculated for a 20 cm far point), the man could stand at a normal distance from the mirror and see clearly.

This problem also demonstrates an important principle of mirror optics: for a plane mirror, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. Therefore, the effective viewing distance is twice the physical distance to the mirror. This doubling effect is why people with limited vision ranges need to stand particularly close to mirrors.

A mother sees that her child's contact lens prescription is 0.750 D. What is the child's near point?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A +0.750 D contact lens prescription indicates farsightedness correction. The lens allows viewing at the normal near point (25.0 cm) by creating a virtual image at the child's actual (farther) near point. Using $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with the lens power and object distance, we can find the image distance, which corresponds to the child's near point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Contact lens power: $$P = +0.750 \text{ D}$$
- Object distance (normal near point): $$d_o = 25.0 \text{ cm} = 0.250 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation for the contact lens:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_i$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_i} = P - \frac{1}{d_o} = 0.750 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.250 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_i} = 0.750 \text{ m}^{-1} - 4.00 \text{ m}^{-1} = -3.25 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_i = \frac{1}{-3.25 \text{ m}^{-1}} = -0.308 \text{ m} = -30.8 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

The negative sign indicates a virtual image. The child's near point is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Near point} = 30.8 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The child's near point is 30.8 cm, which is farther than the normal 25 cm, indicating mild hyperopia (farsightedness). Without corrective lenses, the child cannot clearly see objects closer than 30.8 cm, which would make reading and other close work difficult or uncomfortable.

The +0.750 D contact lens works by converging incoming light rays slightly before they enter the eye, allowing the child to see objects at the normal 25 cm reading distance clearly. The lens creates a virtual image at 30.8 cm (the child's actual near point) of an object at 25 cm, enabling comfortable reading.

For a child, this is a relatively mild prescription. Considerations:
- Many children are naturally slightly farsighted and can compensate through accommodation
- This child likely experiences eye strain or headaches during extended reading without correction
- The prescription may change as the child grows, since children's eyes continue developing

At 30.8 cm, the child would need to hold books farther away than peers to read clearly without correction. While this is manageable, it can cause:
1. Eye fatigue from constant maximum accommodation
2. Headaches from sustained near work
3. Difficulty with fine detail work (drawing, crafts)
4. Slower reading speed due to discomfort

The +0.750 D contact lenses eliminate these issues, allowing the child to read comfortably at the standard 25 cm distance for extended periods without eye strain.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a child with a +0.750 D contact lens prescription and a near point of 30.8 cm. For eyeglasses held 2.20 cm from the eyes, we need to find what prescription will provide the same correction. The spectacle lens must create an image at the child's near point (30.8 cm from the eye, or 28.6 cm from the lens) when viewing an object at the normal near point of 25.0 cm. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Normal near point (object distance from spectacle): $$d_o = 25.0 - 2.20 = 22.8 \text{ cm} = 0.228 \text{ m}$$
- Child's near point from eye: 30.8 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(30.8 - 2.20) = -28.6 \text{ cm} = -0.286 \text{ m}$$

The negative image distance indicates a virtual image on the same side as the object.

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.228 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{-0.286 \text{ m}}$$

Rounding to two significant figures:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0.89 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is +0.89 D, compared to the +0.750 D contact lens. The spectacle lens must be stronger (more positive) by about 0.14 D because it sits 2.20 cm from the eye. This is consistent with the vertex distance effect—for hyperopia (farsightedness), spectacle lenses require more positive power than contact lenses.

The 19% increase in power (from +0.75 D to +0.89 D) may seem large, but it's typical for the vertex distance effect with positive lenses. For hyperopia corrections, the relationship is $$P_{\text{spectacle}} = \frac{P_{\text{contact}}}{1 + d \cdot P_{\text{contact}}}$$, where $$d$$ is the vertex distance. This formula confirms our calculation.

For children, eyeglasses are often preferred over contact lenses for safety and ease of use, despite requiring slightly stronger prescriptions. The child would wear +0.89 D glasses to achieve the same vision correction as +0.75 D contacts. This demonstrates why prescriptions must always specify whether they're for contacts or spectacles—using the wrong prescription could result in under-correction or over-correction.

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For ideal distant vision correction, the contact-tear-eye system must focus distant objects (at infinity) onto the retina. The contact lens power is -4.00 D, and we know the person's uncorrected far point is 22.5 cm. We calculate the eye's relaxed power from the far point, then find the tear layer power needed to achieve the correct total optical power.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Contact lens power: $$P_{\text{lens}} = -4.00 \text{ D}$$
- Far point (uncorrected): 22.5 cm = 0.225 m
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{lens}} + P_{\text{tear}} + P_{\text{eye}} = 50.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Solving for the tear layer power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{tear}} = 50.0 \text{ D} - P_{\text{lens}} - P_{\text{eye}}$$

 $$P_{\text{tear}} = 50.0 \text{ D} + 4.00 \text{ D} - 54.444 \text{ D} = -0.444 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tear layer has a power of -0.444 D (diverging). This negative power is more significant than typical tear layer effects and indicates a notable mismatch between the contact lens curvature and the corneal surface.

Physical interpretation:
- The person's uncorrected eye has 54.444 D (4.444 D excess power causing myopia)
- The -4.00 D contact lens reduces this by 4.00 D
- The -0.444 D tear layer further reduces the power
- Net result: $$54.444 - 4.00 - 0.444 = 50.0$$ D (normal distant vision)

Interestingly, we can verify this is consistent with the far point. If the contact lens alone (-4.00 D) were perfect, it would correct a far point of:
- $$d = 1/4.00 = 0.250$$ m = 25.0 cm

But the actual far point is 22.5 cm (closer than 25 cm), meaning the eye is slightly more myopic than -4.00 D alone would correct. The -0.444 D tear layer provides the additional correction needed.

This problem highlights why contact lens fitting requires careful assessment. The optometrist prescribed -4.00 D knowing that:
1. The tear layer would contribute -0.444 D
2. The combined effect (-4.444 D) exactly matches the needed correction
3. The 22.5 cm far point corresponds to 4.444 D of excess power

If the tear layer effect were ignored, the patient would be slightly under-corrected, with residual myopia making distant objects slightly blurry. Professional contact lens fitting accounts for tear layer effects through trial fittings and refraction measurements with lenses in place.

**Unreasonable Results**

A boy has a near point of 50 cm and a far point of 500 cm. Will a $$-4.00 \text{D} $$ lens correct his far point to infinity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To correct the far point to infinity using a contact lens, we first determine what lens power is actually needed. The lens must create a virtual image at the boy's far point (500 cm) when viewing distant objects. We calculate the required power and compare it to the proposed -4.00 D lens to determine if the correction is appropriate.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: $$d_i = -500 \text{ cm} = -5.00 \text{ m}$$ (virtual image)
- Object distance for distant vision: $$d_o = \infty$$
- Proposed lens power: $$P_{\text{proposed}} = -4.00 \text{ D}$$

Calculate the required lens power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{required}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-5.00 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{required}} = 0 - 0.20 \text{ D} = -0.20 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Comparing with the proposed lens:

The proposed -4.00 D lens is **20 times stronger** than needed. This lens would create an image at:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_i} = P - \frac{1}{d_o} = -4.00 \text{ D} - 0 = -4.00 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_i = -0.25 \text{ m} = -25 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

No, a -4.00 D lens will **not** correct the boy's far point to infinity—it will severely over-correct his vision. The boy only needs a -0.20 D lens, but the proposed lens is 20 times too strong. With a -4.00 D lens, distant objects would appear as images only 25 cm from his eyes, which is actually at his near point!

This demonstrates an unreasonable result. The problem reveals that the boy's vision defect is very mild—his far point of 500 cm (5 meters) is quite distant, requiring only minimal correction. In fact, many people with such mild myopia might not need correction at all for daily activities, though it would help for tasks requiring sharp distant vision like driving or reading a blackboard.

The combination of a 50 cm near point and 500 cm far point is unusual but not impossible. It suggests either early presbyopia (loss of accommodation) combined with mild myopia, or simply a person with limited accommodation range. The key lesson is that lens prescriptions must be carefully matched to the actual vision defect—a stronger lens is not necessarily better and can create new vision problems. Using a -4.00 D lens when only -0.20 D is needed would make the boy effectively very nearsighted, with a new far point of only 25 cm!
