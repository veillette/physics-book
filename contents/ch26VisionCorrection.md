</div>

The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision
defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to
correct. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) illustrates two common vision defects.
**Nearsightedness**, or **myopia**, is the inability to see distant objects
clearly while close objects are clear. The eye overconverges the nearly parallel
rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More
divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear
image. The distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called
the **far point** of the eye (normally infinity). **Farsightedness**, or **hyperopia**, is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects
may be clear. A farsighted eye does not converge sufficient rays from a close
object to make the rays meet on the retina. Less diverging rays from a distant
object can be converged for a clear image. The distance to the closest object
that can be seen clearly is called the **near point** of the eye (normally 25
cm).

![Part a shows two figures of cross-sectional area of eye depicting myopia. In both the figures, parallel rays coming from an object placed at infinity are converging in front of the retina. Figure on the left shows the lens of the eye too strong and figure on the right illustrates the shape of the eye too long. Part b shows two figures of cross-sectional area of eye depicting hyperopia. In both the figures, rays coming from a close object are shown which are converging at the back of the retina. Figure on the left shows the lens of the eye too weak and figure on the right illustrates the shape of the eye too short.](../resources/Figure_26_02_01.jpg '(a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, producing a blurry image. This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina, producing blurry close vision. This can be caused by insufficient power in the lens or by the eye being too short.')
{: #Figure1}

Since the nearsighted eye over converges light rays, the correction for
nearsightedness is to place a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This
reduces the power of an eye that is too powerful. Another way of thinking about
this is that a diverging spectacle lens produces a case 3 image, which is closer
to the eye than the object (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). To determine the
spectacle power needed for correction, you must know the person’s far point—that
is, you must know the greatest distance at which the person can see clearly.
Then the image produced by a spectacle lens must be at this distance or closer
for the nearsighted person to be able to see it clearly. It is worth noting that
wearing glasses does not change the eye in any way. The eyeglass lens is simply
used to create an image of the object at a distance where the nearsighted person
can see it clearly. Whereas someone not wearing glasses can see clearly _
objects_ that fall between their near point and their far point, someone wearing
glasses can see _images_ that fall between their near point and their far point.

![Two illustrations of cross-sectional view of an eye are shown. In the first figure, a diverging spectacle lens is placed in front of the eye structure. A ray diagram for the diverging lens is also shown. Parallel rays from a distant object, taken as tree, are striking the lens and then diverging. A smaller image of the tree is shown in front of the lens. In the second figure, a ray diagram with respect to the diverging lens within the eye structure is shown. Parallel rays from a distant object are striking the diverging lens, entering the lens of the eye, and converging at retina. This explains the correction of nearsightedness using a diverging lens.](../resources/Figure_26_02_02.jpg 'Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for the overconvergence by the eye. The diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the object, so that the nearsighted person can see it clearly.')

Correcting Nearsightedness
</div>
What power of spectacle lens is needed to correct the vision of a nearsighted person whose far point is 30.0 cm? Assume the spectacle (corrective) lens is held 1.50 cm away from the eye by eyeglass frames.

**Strategy**

You want this nearsighted person to be able to see very distant objects clearly.
That means the spectacle lens must produce an image 30.0 cm from the eye for an
object very far away. An image 30.0 cm from the eye will be 28.5 cm to the left
of the spectacle lens (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). Therefore, we must get
$${d}_{\text{i}}=-28.5 \text{cm} $$ when $${d}_{\text{o}}\approx \infty $$ . The
image distance is negative, because it is on the same side of the spectacle as
the object.

**Solution**

Since $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ are known, the power of the
spectacle lens can be found using $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_
{\text{i}}} $$ as written earlier:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{\infty }+\frac{1}{-0.285 \text{m}}. $$
</div>
Since  $$1 \text{/}\infty = 0 $$ ,
 we obtain:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=0 -3.51/\text{m}=-3.51 \text{D}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The negative power indicates a diverging (or concave) lens, as expected. The
spectacle produces a case 3 image closer to the eye, where the person can see
it. If you examine eyeglasses for nearsighted people, you will find the lenses
are thinnest in the center. Additionally, if you examine a prescription for
eyeglasses for nearsighted people, you will find that the prescribed power is
negative and given in units of diopters.

</div>

Since the farsighted eye under converges light rays, the correction for
farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This
increases the power of an eye that is too weak. Another way of thinking about
this is that a converging spectacle lens produces a case 2 image, which is
farther from the eye than the object (see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). To determine
the spectacle power needed for correction, you must know the person’s near
point—that is, you must know the smallest distance at which the person can see
clearly. Then the image produced by a spectacle lens must be at this distance or
farther for the farsighted person to be able to see it clearly.

![Two illustrations of a cross-sectional view of an eye are shown. In the upper part of the figure, a converging lens is placed in front of the eye structure and a close object before it. A ray diagram showing the rays from the object are striking the lens; converging a bit and entering the eyes; converging again through the eye lens and forming an image at the retina, and another set of rays converge behind the retina. The lower part of the figure shows a virtual image, an object, a converging lens, and the internal structure of an eye. Parallel rays from the object are entering the eyes and converging at a point on the retina. An image larger than the object image is formed behind the object on the same side of the lens.](../resources/Figure_26_02_03.jpg 'Correction of farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the under convergence by the eye. The converging lens produces an image farther from the eye than the object, so that the farsighted person can see it clearly.')

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Correcting Farsightedness
</div>
What power of spectacle lens is needed to allow a farsighted person, whose near point is 1.00 m, to see an object clearly that is 25.0 cm away? Assume the spectacle (corrective) lens is held 1.50 cm away from the eye by eyeglass frames.

**Strategy**

When an object is held 25.0 cm from the person’s eyes, the spectacle lens must
produce an image 1.00 m away (the near point). An image 1.00 m from the eye will
be 98.5 cm to the left of the spectacle lens because the spectacle lens is 1.50
cm from the eye (see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). Therefore, $${d}_{\text{i}}=-98.5
\text{cm} $$ . The image distance is negative, because it is on the same side of
the spectacle as the object. The object is 23.5 cm to the left of the spectacle,
so that $${d}_{\text{o}}=23.5 \text{cm} $$.

**Solution**

Since $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{\text{o}} $$ are known, the power of the
spectacle lens can be found using $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_
{\text{i}}} $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}P& =& \frac{1}{ {d}_{o}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{0.235 \text{m}}+\frac{1}{-0.985 \text{m}}\\ & =& 4.26 D-1.02 \text{D}=3.24 \text{D}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The positive power indicates a converging (convex) lens, as expected. The convex
spectacle produces a case 2 image farther from the eye, where the person can see
it. If you examine eyeglasses of farsighted people, you will find the lenses to
be thickest in the center. In addition, a prescription of eyeglasses for
farsighted people has a prescribed power that is positive.

</div>

Another common vision defect is **astigmatism**, an unevenness or asymmetry in
the focus of the eye. For example, rays passing through a vertical region of the
eye may focus closer than rays passing through a horizontal region, resulting in
the image appearing elongated. This is mostly due to irregularities in the shape
of the cornea but can also be due to lens irregularities or unevenness in the
retina. Because of these irregularities, different parts of the lens system
produce images at different locations. The eye-brain system can compensate for
some of these irregularities, but they generally manifest themselves as less
distinct vision or sharper images along certain axes. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)
shows a chart used to detect astigmatism. Astigmatism can be at least partially
corrected with a spectacle having the opposite irregularity of the eye. If an
eyeglass prescription has a cylindrical correction, it is there to correct
astigmatism. The normal corrections for short- or farsightedness are spherical
corrections, uniform along all axes.

![A circle without border and a cross sign in between. A wheel type structure is shown with parallel lines coming from the border of the circle.](../resources/Figure_26_02_04.jpg 'This chart can detect astigmatism, unevenness in the focus of the eye. Check each of your eyes separately by looking at the center cross (without spectacles if you wear them). If lines along some axes appear darker or clearer than others, you have an astigmatism.')
{: #Figure4}

Contact lenses have advantages over glasses beyond their cosmetic aspects. One
problem with glasses is that as the eye moves, it is not at a fixed distance
from the spectacle lens. Contacts rest on and move with the eye, eliminating
this problem. Because contacts cover a significant portion of the cornea, they
provide superior peripheral vision compared with eyeglasses. Contacts also
correct some corneal astigmatism caused by surface irregularities. The tear
layer between the smooth contact and the cornea fills in the irregularities.
Since the index of refraction of the tear layer and the cornea are very similar,
you now have a regular optical surface in place of an irregular one. If the
curvature of a contact lens is not the same as the cornea (as may be necessary
with some individuals to obtain a comfortable fit), the tear layer between the
contact and cornea acts as a lens. If the tear layer is thinner in the center
than at the edges, it has a negative power, for example. Skilled optometrists
will adjust the power of the contact to compensate.

Other advances in vision correction demonstrate the interconnectedness and value of scientific research. In the 1980s, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou worked on ways to make small but powerful lasers. Up until that time, powerful lasers had to be quite large in order to function properly. Essentially, the intensity of the beam itself would modify the instrument’s ability to function and create too much heat to be practical. Strickland and Mourou used ultrashort laser pulses passed over a grating that modified the beam but retained its power. Chirped pulse amplification, as it became known, has been used to develop most of the highest-powered lasers in the world, but also some of the smallest and most common. Decades after their initial discovery, Strickland and Mourou were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics (with Strickland becoming the third woman to receive the award) partly due to CPA’s pivotal role in the increasingly common practice of laser vision correction—an application neither planned during their initial research.

**Laser vision correction** has progressed rapidly in the last few years. It is
the latest and by far the most successful in a series of procedures that correct
vision by reshaping the cornea. As noted at the beginning of this section, the
cornea accounts for about two-thirds of the power of the eye. Thus, small
adjustments of its curvature have the same effect as putting a lens in front of
the eye. To a reasonable approximation, the power of multiple lenses placed
close together equals the sum of their powers. For example, a concave spectacle
lens (for nearsightedness) having $$P=-3.00 \text{D} $$ has the same effect on
vision as reducing the power of the eye itself by 3.00 D. So to correct the eye
for nearsightedness, the cornea is flattened to reduce its power. Similarly, to
correct for farsightedness, the curvature of the cornea is enhanced to increase
the power of the eye—the same effect as the positive power spectacle lens used
for farsightedness. Laser vision correction uses high intensity electromagnetic
radiation to ablate (to remove material from the surface) and reshape the
corneal surfaces.

Today, the most commonly used laser vision correction procedure is _Laser in
situ Keratomileusis (LASIK)_. The top layer of the cornea is surgically peeled
back and the underlying tissue ablated by multiple bursts of finely controlled
ultraviolet radiation produced by an excimer laser. Lasers are used because they
not only produce well-focused intense light, but they also emit very pure
wavelength electromagnetic radiation that can be controlled more accurately than
mixed wavelength light. The 193 nm wavelength UV commonly used is extremely and
strongly absorbed by corneal tissue, allowing precise evaporation of very thin
layers. A computer controlled program applies more bursts, usually at a rate of
10 per second, to the areas that require deeper removal. Typically a spot less
than 1 mm in diameter and about $$0.3 \text{μm} $$ in thickness is removed by
each burst. Nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism can be corrected
with an accuracy that produces normal distant vision in more than 90% of the
patients, in many cases right away. The corneal flap is replaced; healing takes
place rapidly and is nearly painless. More than 1 million Americans per year
undergo LASIK (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

The upper corneal layer is temporarily peeled back and minimally disturbed in LASIK, providing for more rapid and less painful healing of the less sensitive tissues below.

### Section Summary

- Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects and is
  corrected with a diverging lens to reduce power.
- Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects and is
  corrected with a converging lens to increase power.
- In myopia and hyperopia, the corrective lenses produce images at a distance
  that the person can see clearly—the far point and near point, respectively.

What is the near point of a person whose eyes have an accommodated power of 53.5 D?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The near point is the closest distance at which a person can see clearly with fully accommodated vision. Using the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$, where $$P = 53.5$$ D is the accommodated power and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm (lens-to-retina distance), we can solve for the object distance $$d_o$$, which is the near point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Accommodated power: $$P = 53.5 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P - \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 53.5 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 53.5 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 3.5 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{3.5 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.286 \text{ m} = 28.6 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The near point of this person is 28.6 cm, which is slightly farther than the normal near point of 25 cm. This indicates a mild degree of presbyopia or early farsightedness. The accommodated power of 53.5 D represents only a 3.5 D increase over the relaxed power of 50.0 D (for distant vision), compared to the normal 4.0 D accommodation ability. This 12.5% reduction in accommodation power is typical for someone in their 40s or early 50s. While this person can still read without glasses, they may find it more comfortable to hold reading material slightly farther away than the standard 25 cm reading distance.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
In a LASIK vision correction, the power of a patient's eye is increased by 3.00 D. Assuming this produces normal close vision, what was the patient's near point before the procedure?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Normal close vision corresponds to a near point of 25.0 cm, which requires an accommodated power of 54.0 D (as calculated in the text examples). After the LASIK procedure that increases eye power by 3.00 D, the patient achieves this normal near point. Before the procedure, the patient's accommodated power was 3.00 D less. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ to find the original near point with the reduced power.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Power increase from LASIK: $$\Delta P = 3.00 \text{ D}$$
- Normal accommodated power: $$P_{\text{after}} = 54.0 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

The patient's accommodated power before the procedure:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{before}} = P_{\text{after}} - \Delta P = 54.0 \text{ D} - 3.00 \text{ D} = 51.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Using the power equation to find the original near point:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{before}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P_{\text{before}} - \frac{1}{d_i} = 51.0 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 51.0 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{1.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 1.0 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Before the LASIK procedure, the patient's near point was 1.0 m (100 cm), indicating significant hyperopia (farsightedness). This person could not see objects clearly closer than one meter, making reading and other close work impossible without corrective lenses. The 3.00 D power increase from LASIK surgery brought the near point from 100 cm to the normal 25 cm, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life.

This large near point distance explains why the patient needed LASIK. With only 1.0 D of accommodation power before surgery (compared to the normal 4.0 D), this person likely suffered from either severe presbyopia (age-related loss of accommodation) or congenital hyperopia. After surgery, with their total accommodated power now at 54.0 D, they can read normally without glasses. This demonstrates how LASIK can correct not just distant vision problems (myopia) but also near vision problems (hyperopia).

A severely myopic patient has a far point of 5.00 cm. By how many diopters should the power of his eye be reduced in laser vision correction to obtain normal distant vision for him?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For normal distant vision, the relaxed eye should have a power of 50.0 D (corresponding to a far point at infinity). The patient's current relaxed power can be calculated from their far point of 5.00 cm using $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$. The difference between the current power and the normal power gives the required power reduction.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Current far point: $$d_o = 5.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$
- Normal relaxed power: $$P_{\text{normal}} = 50.0 \text{ D}$$

Calculate the current relaxed power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{current}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.0500 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{current}} = 20.0 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 70.0 \text{ D}$$

The required power reduction:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta P = P_{\text{current}} - P_{\text{normal}} = 70.0 \text{ D} - 50.0 \text{ D} = 20.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The patient's eye power must be reduced by 20.0 D to achieve normal distant vision. This is a very large correction, reflecting the severity of the myopia—the patient can only see clearly up to 5.00 cm away, which is extremely close. With a far point this close, the patient would be unable to perform most daily tasks without corrective lenses.

A 20.0 D power reduction is at the upper limit of what LASIK can typically achieve safely. Most LASIK procedures correct between -1.00 D to -12.00 D of myopia. A 20.0 D correction would require removing a significant amount of corneal tissue, potentially compromising corneal strength and stability. For such severe myopia, alternative procedures like phakic intraocular lenses (implantable lenses placed inside the eye) might be more appropriate. This problem illustrates the limitations of laser vision correction and why careful patient screening is essential before surgery.

The power of a physician's eyes is 53.0 D while examining a patient. How far from her eyes is the feature being examined?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Using the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$, where $$P = 53.0$$ D and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm, we can solve for the object distance $$d_o$$, which represents how far the examined feature is from the physician's eyes.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Eye power: $$P = 53.0 \text{ D}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P - \frac{1}{d_i} = 53.0 \text{ D} - \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = 53.0 \text{ m}^{-1} - 50.0 \text{ m}^{-1} = 3.0 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{3.0 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.333 \text{ m} = 33.3 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The feature being examined is 33.3 cm from the physician's eyes. This is a comfortable working distance for close examination, slightly farther than the standard near point of 25 cm. The physician is using an accommodated power of 53.0 D, which represents 3.0 D of accommodation beyond the relaxed power of 50.0 D.

This distance is typical for medical examinations where the physician needs to look closely at a patient's features (such as examining eyes, ears, throat, or skin lesions) but still maintain a comfortable working distance. It's close enough to see fine details but far enough to avoid discomfort for both patient and physician. The 3.0 D of accommodation required is well within the normal accommodation range, so the physician can maintain this examination distance for extended periods without significant eye strain.

The far point of a myopic administrator is 50.0 cm. (a) What is the relaxed power of their eyes? (b) If they have the normal 8.00% ability to accommodate, what is the closest object they can see clearly?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with the far point distance (50.0 cm) as $$d_o$$ to find the relaxed power. For part (b), an 8.00% accommodation ability means the accommodated power is 1.08 times the relaxed power. We then use the power equation to find the near point.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: $$d_o = 50.0 \text{ cm} = 0.500 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$
- Accommodation ability: 8.00%

**(a)** Calculate the relaxed power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{relaxed}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.500 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{relaxed}} = 2.00 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 52.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate the accommodated power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{accommodated}} = 1.08 \times P_{\text{relaxed}} = 1.08 \times 52.0 \text{ D} = 56.2 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Find the near point using the accommodated power:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_o} = P_{\text{accommodated}} - \frac{1}{d_i} = 56.2 \text{ D} - 50.0 \text{ D} = 6.2 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = \frac{1}{6.2 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 0.161 \text{ m} = 16.1 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The relaxed power of 52.0 D is higher than the normal 50.0 D, confirming this person is myopic (nearsighted). The excess 2.0 D of power causes distant objects beyond 50.0 cm to appear blurry.

Part (b): The near point of 16.1 cm is actually closer than the normal 25 cm. This is an interesting benefit of mild myopia—myopic people can see close objects more clearly than people with normal vision. The administrator can read comfortably at 16.1 cm, which is advantageous for detailed close work.

This problem illustrates that myopia has a "silver lining": while distant vision is compromised, near vision is enhanced. This is why some older people with presbyopia may deliberately under-correct their myopia or use reading glasses weaker than needed—they want to preserve their advantage in close-up tasks. However, for most daily activities requiring both near and distant vision, corrective lenses for myopia are still beneficial. The administrator would need -2.00 D corrective lenses to see distant objects clearly.

Repeat the previous problem for eyeglasses held 1.50 cm from the eyes.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a myopic man with a far point of 20.0 cm who needed a -5.00 D contact lens. For eyeglasses held 1.50 cm from the eye, we must account for this separation. The spectacle lens must create an image at the far point (20.0 cm from the eye, or 18.5 cm from the lens) when viewing distant objects. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$d_o = \infty$$ and $$d_i = -18.5$$ cm.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point from eye: 20.0 cm
- Spectacle distance from eye: 1.50 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(20.0 - 1.50) = -18.5 \text{ cm} = -0.185 \text{ m}$$
- Object distance: $$d_o = \infty$$ (distant objects)

The negative image distance indicates the image is on the same side as the object (virtual image).

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-0.185 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0 - 5.41 \text{ m}^{-1} = -5.41 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is -5.41 D, which is slightly more negative than the -5.00 D contact lens. This difference arises because the spectacle lens is 1.50 cm farther from the eye's optical system. The farther the corrective lens is from the eye, the stronger it must be to create an image at the same location.

This 0.41 D difference may seem small, but it's clinically significant. This is why contact lens and eyeglass prescriptions differ for the same person—the prescription must account for the vertex distance (distance from the lens to the cornea). For mild prescriptions, this difference is negligible, but for strong prescriptions like this one, it becomes important. An optometrist must adjust the prescription when converting between contacts and glasses, typically making spectacles slightly stronger (more negative for myopia) than contact lenses.

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a myopic person with a -4.00 D contact lens prescription and a far point of 25.0 cm. For eyeglasses held 1.75 cm from the eyes, the spectacle lens must create an image at the far point (25.0 cm from the eye, or 23.25 cm from the lens) when viewing distant objects. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$ with $$d_o = \infty$$ and $$d_i = -23.25$$ cm.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point from eye: 25.0 cm
- Spectacle distance from eye: 1.75 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(25.0 - 1.75) = -23.25 \text{ cm} = -0.2325 \text{ m}$$
- Object distance: $$d_o = \infty$$ (distant objects)

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-0.2325 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0 - 4.30 \text{ m}^{-1} = -4.30 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is -4.30 D, compared to the -4.00 D contact lens. The spectacle lens must be 0.30 D stronger (more negative) because it sits 1.75 cm from the eye. This vertex distance effect is important for accurate vision correction.

For this moderate myopia prescription, the vertex distance correction is about 7.5% of the contact lens power. This difference becomes more pronounced with stronger prescriptions. An optometrist typically uses the formula $$P_{\text{spectacle}} = \frac{P_{\text{contact}}}{1 - d \cdot P_{\text{contact}}}$$ where $$d$$ is the vertex distance, to accurately convert between contact and spectacle prescriptions.

The fact that spectacle lenses need to be stronger than contact lenses for myopia correction is one reason why some people prefer contacts—they provide correction with less optical power, which can reduce optical distortions and weight of the lenses. However, for mild to moderate myopia like this case, the difference is small enough that either option provides excellent vision correction.

A nearsighted man cannot see objects clearly beyond 20 cm from his eyes. How close must he stand to a mirror in order to see what he is doing when he shaves?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The man's far point is 20 cm, meaning he can see clearly only up to this distance. When looking in a mirror, he sees an image of his face that appears to be behind the mirror at a distance equal to his distance from the mirror. For clear vision, the total optical path (from his eyes to the mirror and back to the apparent image location) must be within his far point of 20 cm. If he stands at distance $$d$$ from the mirror, the image appears at distance $$d$$ behind the mirror, making the total distance $$2d$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: 20 cm
- Total optical distance to image: $$2d$$ (where $$d$$ is distance to mirror)

For clear vision, the image distance must equal the far point:

<div class="equation">
 $$2d = 20 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d = 10 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The man must stand 10 cm from the mirror to see himself clearly while shaving. At this distance, the image of his face appears 10 cm behind the mirror surface, making the total optical path 20 cm—exactly his far point.

This is quite close to the mirror, which would be awkward and impractical for shaving. The mirror would likely fog from his breath, and maneuvering a razor would be difficult at such close range. This problem illustrates why uncorrected myopia significantly impacts daily activities. With -5.00 D corrective lenses (as calculated for a 20 cm far point), the man could stand at a normal distance from the mirror and see clearly.

This problem also demonstrates an important principle of mirror optics: for a plane mirror, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. Therefore, the effective viewing distance is twice the physical distance to the mirror. This doubling effect is why people with limited vision ranges need to stand particularly close to mirrors.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The previous problem involved a child with a +0.750 D contact lens prescription and a near point of 30.8 cm. For eyeglasses held 2.20 cm from the eyes, we need to find what prescription will provide the same correction. The spectacle lens must create an image at the child's near point (30.8 cm from the eye, or 28.6 cm from the lens) when viewing an object at the normal near point of 25.0 cm. We use $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Normal near point (object distance from spectacle): $$d_o = 25.0 - 2.20 = 22.8 \text{ cm} = 0.228 \text{ m}$$
- Child's near point from eye: 30.8 cm
- Image distance from spectacle: $$d_i = -(30.8 - 2.20) = -28.6 \text{ cm} = -0.286 \text{ m}$$

The negative image distance indicates a virtual image on the same side as the object.

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.228 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{-0.286 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 4.39 \text{ D} - 3.50 \text{ D} = 0.89 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Rounding to two significant figures:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0.89 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required spectacle lens power is +0.89 D, compared to the +0.750 D contact lens. The spectacle lens must be stronger (more positive) by about 0.14 D because it sits 2.20 cm from the eye. This is consistent with the vertex distance effect—for hyperopia (farsightedness), spectacle lenses require more positive power than contact lenses.

The 19% increase in power (from +0.75 D to +0.89 D) may seem large, but it's typical for the vertex distance effect with positive lenses. For hyperopia corrections, the relationship is $$P_{\text{spectacle}} = \frac{P_{\text{contact}}}{1 + d \cdot P_{\text{contact}}}$$, where $$d$$ is the vertex distance. This formula confirms our calculation.

For children, eyeglasses are often preferred over contact lenses for safety and ease of use, despite requiring slightly stronger prescriptions. The child would wear +0.89 D glasses to achieve the same vision correction as +0.75 D contacts. This demonstrates why prescriptions must always specify whether they're for contacts or spectacles—using the wrong prescription could result in under-correction or over-correction.

**Unreasonable Results**

A boy has a near point of 50 cm and a far point of 500 cm. Will a $$-4.00
\text{D} $$ lens correct his far point to infinity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To correct the far point to infinity using a contact lens, we first determine what lens power is actually needed. The lens must create a virtual image at the boy's far point (500 cm) when viewing distant objects. We calculate the required power and compare it to the proposed -4.00 D lens to determine if the correction is appropriate.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Far point: $$d_i = -500 \text{ cm} = -5.00 \text{ m}$$ (virtual image)
- Object distance for distant vision: $$d_o = \infty$$
- Proposed lens power: $$P_{\text{proposed}} = -4.00 \text{ D}$$

Calculate the required lens power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{required}} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-5.00 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{required}} = 0 - 0.20 \text{ D} = -0.20 \text{ D}$$
</div>

Comparing with the proposed lens:

The proposed -4.00 D lens is **20 times stronger** than needed. This lens would create an image at:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_i} = P - \frac{1}{d_o} = -4.00 \text{ D} - 0 = -4.00 \text{ m}^{-1}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_i = -0.25 \text{ m} = -25 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

No, a -4.00 D lens will **not** correct the boy's far point to infinity—it will severely over-correct his vision. The boy only needs a -0.20 D lens, but the proposed lens is 20 times too strong. With a -4.00 D lens, distant objects would appear as images only 25 cm from his eyes, which is actually at his near point!

This demonstrates an unreasonable result. The problem reveals that the boy's vision defect is very mild—his far point of 500 cm (5 meters) is quite distant, requiring only minimal correction. In fact, many people with such mild myopia might not need correction at all for daily activities, though it would help for tasks requiring sharp distant vision like driving or reading a blackboard.

The combination of a 50 cm near point and 500 cm far point is unusual but not impossible. It suggests either early presbyopia (loss of accommodation) combined with mild myopia, or simply a person with limited accommodation range. The key lesson is that lens prescriptions must be carefully matched to the actual vision defect—a stronger lens is not necessarily better and can create new vision problems. Using a -4.00 D lens when only -0.20 D is needed would make the boy effectively very nearsighted, with a new far point of only 25 cm!
