{: #Figure1}

Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of
frequency and wavelength. You can observe direct evidence of the speed of sound
while watching a fireworks display. The flash of an explosion is seen well
before its sound is heard, implying both that sound travels at a finite speed
and that it is much slower than light. You can also directly sense the frequency
of a sound. Perception of frequency is called **pitch**. The wavelength of sound
is not directly sensed, but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the
size of musical instruments with their pitch. Small instruments, such as a
piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while large instruments, such as a
tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High pitch means small wavelength, and
the size of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound
it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds. Similar
arguments hold that a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.

The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the
same as for all waves:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda , $$
</div>

where $${v}_{w} $$ is the speed of sound, $$f $$ is its frequency, and $$\lambda $$
is its wavelength. The wavelength of a sound is the distance between adjacent
identical parts of a wave—for example, between adjacent compressions as
illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). The frequency is the same as that of the
source and is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

![A picture of a vibrating tuning fork is shown. The sound wave compressions and rarefactions are shown to emanate from the fork on both the sides as semicircular arcs of alternate bold and dotted lines. The wavelength is marked as the distance between two successive bold arcs. The frequency of the vibrations is shown as f and velocity of the wave represented by v sub w.](../resources/Figure_17_02_02.jpg "A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency \( f \), propagates at \( v_w \) , and has a wavelength \( \lambda \).")
{: #Figure2}

[[Table 1]](#Table1) makes it apparent that the speed of sound varies greatly in
different media. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination
of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more
rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. This
observation is analogous to the fact that the frequency of a simple harmonic
motion is directly proportional to the stiffness of the oscillating object. The
greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. This observation
is analogous to the fact that the frequency of a simple harmonic motion is
inversely proportional to the mass of the oscillating object. The speed of sound
in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are
relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such
media is generally greater than in gases.

Earthquakes, essentially sound waves in Earth’s crust, are an interesting
example of how the speed of sound depends on the rigidity of the medium.
Earthquakes have both longitudinal and transverse components, and these travel
at different speeds. The bulk modulus of granite is greater than its shear
modulus. For that reason, the speed of longitudinal or pressure waves (P-waves)
in earthquakes in granite is significantly higher than the speed of transverse
or shear waves (S-waves). Both components of earthquakes travel slower in less
rigid material, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and
S-waves correspondingly range in speed from 2 to 5 km/s, both being faster in
more rigid material. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave
as they travel through Earth’s crust. The time between the P- and S-waves is
routinely used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the
earthquake. The time and nature of these wave differences also provides the evidence for the nature of Earth's core. Through careful analysis of seismographic records of large earthquakes whose waves could be clearly detected around the world, Richard Dixon Oldham established that waves passing through the center of the Earth behaved as if they were moving through a different medium: a liquid. Later on, Inge Lehmann used more precise observations (partly based on a better coordinated network of seismographs she helped set up) to better define the nature of the core: that it was a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core.

The speed of sound is affected by temperature in a given medium. For air at sea
level, the speed of sound is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}}, $$
</div>

where the temperature (denoted as $$T $$ )
is in units of kelvin. The speed of sound in gases is related to the average
speed of particles in the gas, $${v}_{\text{rms}} $$ , and that

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}, $$
</div>

where $$k_{B} $$ is the Boltzmann constant ( $$1.38 \times 10^{\text{−23}} \text{J/K} $$ )
and $$m $$ is the mass of each (identical) particle in the gas. So, it is
reasonable that the speed of sound in air and other gases should depend on the
square root of temperature. While not negligible, this is not a strong
dependence. At $$0 \text{ºC} $$ , the speed of sound is 331 m/s, whereas at
$$20.0 \text{ºC} $$ it is 343 m/s, less than a 4%
increase. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a use of the speed of sound by a bat to
sense distances. Echoes are also used in medical imaging.

![The picture is of a bat trying to catch its prey an insect using sound echoes. The incident sound and sound reflected from the bat are shown as semicircular arcs.](../resources/Figure_17_02_03.jpg "A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the distance.")
{: #Figure3}

One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly
independent of frequency. This independence is certainly true in open air for
sounds in the audible range of 20 to 20 000 Hz. If this independence were not
true, you would certainly notice it for music played by a marching band in a
football stadium, for example. Suppose that high-frequency sounds traveled
faster—then the farther you were from the band, the more the sound from the
low-pitch instruments would lag that from the high-pitch ones. But the music
from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all
frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed. Recall that

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda . $$
</div>

In a given medium under fixed conditions, $${v}_{\text{w}} $$ is constant, so
that there is a relationship between $$f $$ and $$\lambda $$ ; the higher the
frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) and consider
the following example.

![Picture of a speaker having a woofer and a tweeter. High frequency sound coming out of the woofer shown as small circles closely spaced. Low frequency sound coming out of tweeter are shown as larger circles distantly spaced.](../resources/Figure_17_02_04.jpg "Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter.")

Calculating Wavelengths: What Are the Wavelengths of Audible Sounds?
</div>
Calculate the wavelengths of sounds at the extremes of the audible range, 20 and 20 000 Hz, in  $$30.0 \text{ºC} $$
 air. (Assume that the frequency values are accurate to two significant figures.)

**Strategy**

To find wavelength from frequency, we can use $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify knowns. The value for $${v}_{\text{w}} $$ , is given by
   <div class="equation" >
   $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}}. $$
   </div>

2. Convert the temperature into kelvin and then enter the temperature into the
   equation
   <div class="equation" >
   $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{303 \text{K}}{273 \text{K}}}= 348.7 \text{m/s}. $$
   </div>

3. Solve the relationship between speed and wavelength for $$\lambda $$ \:
   <div class="equation" >
     $$\lambda =\frac{ {v}_{w}}{f}. $$
   </div>

4. Enter the speed and the minimum frequency to give the maximum wavelength:
   <div class="equation" >
     $${\lambda }_{\text{max}}=\frac{ 348.7 \text{m/s}}{20 \text{Hz}}=17 \text{m}. $$
   </div>

5. Enter the speed and the maximum frequency to give the minimum wavelength:
   <div class="equation" >
     $${\lambda }_{\text{min}}=\frac{ 348.7 \text{m/s}}{20\text{,}000 \text{Hz}}= 0.017 \text{m}=1.7 \text{cm}. $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

Because the product of $$f $$ multiplied by $$\lambda $$ equals a constant, the
smaller $$f $$ is, the larger $$\lambda $$ must be, and vice versa.

</div>

The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another.
However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven
oscillation and has the frequency of the original source. If $${v}_{\text{w}} $$
changes and $$f $$ remains the same, then the wavelength $$\lambda $$ must
change. That is, because $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda $$ , the higher the speed of
a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
How do sound vibrations of atoms differ from thermal motion?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
Sound vibrations are a form of organized, collective motion where atoms oscillate in a coordinated way around their equilibrium positions, creating a pressure wave that propagates through the medium. This motion is coherent, meaning the atoms move in a predictable, synchronized pattern (compressions and rarefactions).

Thermal motion, on the other hand, is the random, chaotic, and incoherent movement of atoms due to their thermal energy. The atoms move in all directions with a wide range of speeds, and their motion is not coordinated. While both sound and thermal motion are forms of kinetic energy, sound is an organized transfer of energy, whereas thermal energy is disorganized.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
When sound passes from one medium to another where its propagation speed is different, does its frequency or wavelength change? Explain your answer briefly.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
The frequency of the sound wave remains the same, while the wavelength changes.

**Explanation**: The frequency of a wave is determined by its source and does not change when the wave passes from one medium to another. The wave speed, however, is a property of the medium and does change. According to the wave equation ($$v_w = f\lambda$$), if the speed ($$v_w$$) changes and the frequency ($$f$$) remains constant, the wavelength ($$\lambda$$) must change to maintain the equality. For example, when sound travels from air to water, its speed increases, so its wavelength must also increase.

When poked by a spear, an operatic soprano lets out a 1200-Hz shriek. What is its wavelength if the speed of sound is 345 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We are given the frequency and speed of the sound wave and need to find its wavelength. We can use the fundamental wave equation $$v_w = f\lambda$$ and solve for wavelength.

**Solution**

Given:
- Frequency: $$f = 1200 \text{ Hz}$$
- Speed of sound: $$v_w = 345 \text{ m/s}$$

Rearranging the wave equation to solve for wavelength:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{v_w}{f}$$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda = \frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{1200 \text{ Hz}} = 0.288 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The wavelength of 0.288 m (or 28.8 cm) is reasonable for a high-pitched sound. This is roughly the length of a ruler, which makes sense for a sound in the audible range. Higher-frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, and 1200 Hz is in the mid-to-high frequency range of human hearing. This wavelength would be comparable to the size of small musical instruments that produce similar frequencies.

The shriek has a wavelength of 0.288 m.

What frequency sound has a 0.10-m wavelength when the speed of sound is 340 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We are given the wavelength and speed of sound and need to find the frequency. We can use the wave equation $$v_w = f\lambda$$ and solve for frequency.

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 0.10 \text{ m}$$
- Speed of sound: $$v_w = 340 \text{ m/s}$$

Rearranging the wave equation to solve for frequency:

<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{v_w}{\lambda}$$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{340 \text{ m/s}}{0.10 \text{ m}} = 3400 \text{ Hz} = 3.4 \text{ kHz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

A frequency of 3400 Hz is well within the audible range for humans (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz) and would be perceived as a relatively high-pitched sound. The wavelength of 0.10 m (10 cm) is quite short, which is consistent with this high frequency. This is approximately the size of a grapefruit. Musical instruments that produce sounds at this frequency would typically be small, such as a piccolo or the upper range of a violin. The inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency is clearly demonstrated: a small wavelength corresponds to a high frequency.

The frequency of the sound is 3400 Hz or 3.4 kHz.

Calculate the speed of sound on a day when a 1500 Hz frequency has a wavelength of 0.221 m.

**Strategy**

We are given both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave and need to find the speed of sound. We can directly apply the wave equation $$v_w = f\lambda$$.

**Solution**

Given:
- Frequency: $$f = 1500 \text{ Hz}$$
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 0.221 \text{ m}$$

Using the wave equation:

<div class="equation">
$$v_w = f\lambda$$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
$$v_w = (1500 \text{ Hz})(0.221 \text{ m}) = 332 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The calculated speed of sound is 332 m/s, which is slightly slower than the standard value of 343 m/s at 20°C. This indicates that the air temperature on this day is lower than 20°C. Using the temperature-dependent speed formula $$v_w = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{T/273 \text{ K}}$$, we can estimate that the temperature is approximately 3°C. This is a reasonable temperature for a cool day. The result demonstrates how sound speed varies with atmospheric conditions, which is important for applications like sonar, musical acoustics, and outdoor sound propagation.

The speed of sound on this day is 332 m/s.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the wave equation $$v_w = f\lambda$$ with the given frequency and wavelength. For part (b), we compare our calculated speed to the values in Table 1 to identify the medium.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given:
- Frequency: $$f = 100 \text{ kHz} = 100 \times 10^3 \text{ Hz} = 1.00 \times 10^5 \text{ Hz}$$
- Wavelength: $$\lambda = 5.96 \text{ cm} = 0.0596 \text{ m}$$

Using the wave equation:

<div class="equation">
$$v_w = f\lambda = (1.00 \times 10^5 \text{ Hz})(0.0596 \text{ m}) = 5960 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**(b)** Comparing this speed to Table 1, we find that steel has a speed of sound of 5960 m/s. Therefore, the medium is most likely **steel**.

**Discussion**

The speed of 5960 m/s is much faster than sound in air (343 m/s) or water (1480 m/s), which indicates a solid medium. Among solids, steel is known for its high rigidity and density combination that produces very fast sound propagation. The high frequency of 100 kHz (ultrasound range, well above human hearing) and short wavelength of about 6 cm are typical for ultrasonic testing applications in steel structures and components. This technique is commonly used in non-destructive testing to detect flaws in metal parts. The perfect match with steel's sound speed in the table confirms our identification.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to use the temperature-dependent formula for the speed of sound in air: $$v_w = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{T/273 \text{ K}}$$. First, we must convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, then substitute into the formula.

**Solution**

Given:
- Temperature: $$T = 20.0 \text{°C}$$

Step 1: Convert temperature to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
$$T = 20.0 + 273 = 293 \text{ K}$$

**Discussion**

This calculation confirms the stated value of 343 m/s for the speed of sound at room temperature (20°C). The speed increases by about 3.6% compared to the speed at 0°C (331 m/s), which demonstrates the square root dependence on absolute temperature. This temperature dependence arises because sound propagation in gases is related to the average molecular speed, which also depends on $$\sqrt{T}$$. The value 343 m/s is commonly used as a standard reference for sound speed in air and is important for many practical applications, from acoustics to weather prediction.

The speed of sound in 20.0°C air is indeed 343 m/s, as claimed.

Given:

</div>

**Discussion**

The speed of sound at 56.0°C (363 m/s) is significantly faster than at room temperature (343 m/s at 20°C), representing about a 5.8% increase. This is also nearly 10% faster than at 0°C (331 m/s). The higher speed is due to the increased kinetic energy of air molecules at elevated temperatures, which allows pressure disturbances (sound waves) to propagate more quickly. This temperature effect is important for sound propagation in desert environments and can affect acoustic phenomena like echo location and sound transmission over distances. The extreme heat in the Sahara creates interesting acoustic effects and must be considered in any sound-based measurements or communications in such environments.

The speed of sound in 56.0°C air is 363 m/s.

Dolphins make sounds in air and water. What is the ratio of the wavelength of a sound in air to its wavelength in seawater? Assume air temperature is  $$20.0 \text{ºC} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When a sound travels from one medium to another, its frequency remains constant (determined by the source), but its speed and wavelength change. We can use $$v_w = f\lambda$$ for each medium. The ratio of wavelengths equals the ratio of speeds since frequency is constant: $$\lambda_{\text{air}}/\lambda_{\text{water}} = v_{\text{air}}/v_{\text{water}}$$.

**Solution**

From Table 1:
- Speed of sound in air at 20.0°C: $$v_{\text{air}} = 343 \text{ m/s}$$
- Speed of sound in seawater: $$v_{\text{water}} = 1540 \text{ m/s}$$

For a sound of frequency $$f$$ in both media:

In air: $$\lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{f}$$

In seawater: $$\lambda_{\text{water}} = \frac{v_{\text{water}}}{f}$$

Taking the ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\lambda_{\text{air}}}{\lambda_{\text{water}}} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}/f}{v_{\text{water}}/f} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{v_{\text{water}}} = \frac{343 \text{ m/s}}{1540 \text{ m/s}} = 0.223$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The wavelength in air is only about 22% of the wavelength in seawater for the same frequency. This makes sense because sound travels much faster in water (about 4.5 times faster) due to water's greater density and incompressibility compared to air. For example, if a dolphin produces a 10 kHz sound, it would have a wavelength of 3.43 cm in air but 15.4 cm in water. This significant difference is important for understanding dolphin echolocation, which works differently in air versus water. Dolphins are primarily adapted for underwater sound production and reception, which is why they use much higher frequencies underwater to achieve useful wavelengths for echolocation.

The ratio of the wavelength in air to the wavelength in seawater is 0.223.

A sonar echo returns to a submarine 1.20 s after being emitted. What is the distance to the object creating the echo? (Assume that the submarine is in the ocean, not in fresh water.)

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The sonar pulse travels to the object and back, so the total distance traveled is twice the distance to the object. We use the relationship $$d = vt$$, where $$v$$ is the speed of sound in seawater and $$t$$ is the time for the round trip. The distance to the object is half the total distance traveled.

**Solution**

Given:
- Echo time (round trip): $$t = 1.20 \text{ s}$$
- Speed of sound in seawater (from Table 1): $$v = 1540 \text{ m/s}$$

Total distance traveled by sound (to object and back):

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{total}} = vt = (1540 \text{ m/s})(1.20 \text{ s}) = 1848 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Distance to object (half the total distance):

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{d_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{1848 \text{ m}}{2} = 924 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The object is 924 m away, which is less than a kilometer. This is a reasonable detection range for submarine sonar systems. The key insight is that we must divide by 2 because the sound makes a round trip—out to the object and back. This principle is fundamental to all echo-based ranging systems, including sonar, radar, and ultrasound imaging. The relatively fast speed of sound in seawater (1540 m/s, about 4.5 times faster than in air) allows submarines to detect objects at considerable distances with relatively short time delays. Note that we assumed the submarine is stationary and the sound travels in a straight line, which are reasonable approximations for this problem.

The distance to the object is 924 m.

(a) If a submarine's sonar can measure echo times with a precision of 0.0100 s, what is the smallest difference in distances it can detect? (Assume that the submarine is in the ocean, not in fresh water.)

(b) Discuss the limits this time resolution imposes on the ability of the sonar
system to detect the size and shape of the object creating the echo.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), the time precision determines the minimum detectable distance difference. Since sound travels to an object and back, the distance resolution is half the distance traveled during the minimum time interval. For part (b), we consider what this distance resolution means for practical object detection.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given:
- Time precision: $$\Delta t = 0.0100 \text{ s}$$
- Speed of sound in seawater: $$v = 1540 \text{ m/s}$$

Distance traveled by sound during the minimum time interval:

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{total}} = v \Delta t = (1540 \text{ m/s})(0.0100 \text{ s}) = 15.4 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Since this is a round-trip distance, the minimum resolvable distance difference is:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta d = \frac{d_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{15.4 \text{ m}}{2} = 7.70 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**(b)** The distance resolution of 7.70 m imposes significant limitations on the sonar system's ability to detect fine details. Objects or features smaller than about 8 m cannot be resolved as separate entities. This means that sonar is excellent for spotting and locating large objects such as ships, submarines, whales, or large pieces of wreckage (like airplane fuselage sections), but it cannot resolve smaller objects or detect the detailed shapes and surface features of objects. For example, two objects separated by less than 7.70 m would appear as a single target. Small debris, individual fish, or surface texture details would be invisible to this system. Higher resolution would require either improved timing precision or higher frequency sound waves, though the latter suffers from increased attenuation in water.

**Discussion**

This limitation is fundamental to all pulse-echo ranging systems and represents a trade-off between timing precision and system complexity. Modern military sonar systems often use much higher precision timing and sophisticated signal processing to achieve better resolution. The 7.70 m resolution found here is actually quite coarse by modern standards but illustrates the basic principle. Note that this is the range resolution (along the line of sight); cross-range resolution (perpendicular to the line of sight) depends on the angular beamwidth of the sonar array, which is a separate consideration.

(a) The smallest difference in distances the sonar can detect is 7.70 m. (b) This resolution means sonar is effective for detecting and locating large objects like ships or submarines, but cannot resolve smaller objects or fine structural details smaller than approximately 8 m.

A physicist at a fireworks display times the lag between seeing an explosion and hearing its sound, and finds it to be 0.400 s. (a) How far away is the explosion if air temperature is  $$24.0 \text{ºC} $$
 and if you neglect the time taken for light to reach the physicist? (b) Calculate the distance to the explosion taking the speed of light into account. Note that this distance is negligibly greater.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we first calculate the speed of sound at the given temperature, then use $$d = vt$$ where the time is the observed lag. For part (b), we account for the fact that light also takes time to travel, though this is negligible compared to sound. The lag time is $$t_{\text{lag}} = t_{\text{sound}} - t_{\text{light}}$$, where both times depend on the distance.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given:
- Time lag: $$t = 0.400 \text{ s}$$
- Air temperature: $$T = 24.0 \text{°C} = 297 \text{ K}$$

First, calculate the speed of sound at this temperature:

<div class="equation">
$$v_w = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{ K}}} = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{297 \text{ K}}{273 \text{ K}}} = (331 \text{ m/s})(1.043) = 345 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Distance to the explosion (neglecting light travel time):

<div class="equation">
$$d = v_w t = (345 \text{ m/s})(0.400 \text{ s}) = 138 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**(b)** To account for light travel time, we use:
- Speed of light: $$c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$
- Time lag: $$t_{\text{lag}} = t_{\text{sound}} - t_{\text{light}} = \frac{d}{v_w} - \frac{d}{c}$$

Solving for $$d$$:

<div class="equation">
$$0.400 = d\left(\frac{1}{345} - \frac{1}{3.00 \times 10^8}\right) = d\left(\frac{1}{345}\right)\left(1 - \frac{345}{3.00 \times 10^8}\right)$$
</div>

Since $$345/(3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.15 \times 10^{-6} \ll 1$$, we can approximate:

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{0.400 \text{ s}}{1/345 \text{ s/m}} = 138 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The correction would be only $$d \times (1.15 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.000159 \text{ m} = 0.16 \text{ mm}$$, which is completely negligible.

**Discussion**

The explosion is approximately 138 m away. The correction for light travel time is only 0.16 mm, which confirms that light effectively travels instantaneously over such short distances. The speed of light is about one million times faster than sound, so for distances of hundreds of meters, we can safely ignore the time light takes to travel. This "flash-to-bang" method is commonly used to estimate distances to lightning strikes and fireworks. A useful rule of thumb is that sound travels approximately 1 km in 3 seconds (or 1 mile in 5 seconds), making mental distance calculations easy during thunderstorms.

(a) The explosion is 138 m away when neglecting light travel time. (b) Accounting for light travel time, the distance is still 138 m (to three significant figures), as the correction is only 0.16 mm.

Suppose a bat uses sound echoes to locate its insect prey, 3.00 m away. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) (a) Calculate the echo times for temperatures of  $$5.00 \text{ºC} $$
 and  $$35.0 \text{ºC} $$ .
 (b) What percent uncertainty does this cause for the bat in locating the insect? (c) Discuss the significance of this uncertainty and whether it could cause difficulties for the bat. (In practice, the bat continues to use sound as it closes in, eliminating most of any difficulties imposed by this and other effects, such as motion of the prey.)

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we calculate the speed of sound at each temperature, then find the round-trip echo time using $$t = 2d/v_w$$ (factor of 2 for the round trip). For part (b), we find the percent difference between the two echo times. For part (c), we interpret what this uncertainty means for the bat's hunting ability.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given:
- Distance to prey: $$d = 3.00 \text{ m}$$
- Temperatures: $$T_1 = 5.00 \text{°C} = 278 \text{ K}$$ and $$T_2 = 35.0 \text{°C} = 308 \text{ K}$$

Speed of sound at $$5.00 \text{°C}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$v_1 = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{278 \text{ K}}{273 \text{ K}}} = (331 \text{ m/s})(1.009) = 334 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Echo time at $$5.00 \text{°C}$$ (round trip):

<div class="equation">
$$t_1 = \frac{2d}{v_1} = \frac{2(3.00 \text{ m})}{334 \text{ m/s}} = 0.0180 \text{ s} = 18.0 \text{ ms}$$
</div>

Speed of sound at $$35.0 \text{°C}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$v_2 = (331 \text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{308 \text{ K}}{273 \text{ K}}} = (331 \text{ m/s})(1.061) = 351 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Echo time at $$35.0 \text{°C}$$ (round trip):

<div class="equation">
$$t_2 = \frac{2d}{v_2} = \frac{2(3.00 \text{ m})}{351 \text{ m/s}} = 0.0171 \text{ s} = 17.1 \text{ ms}$$
</div>

**(b)** Percent uncertainty (using the difference relative to the average):

<div class="equation">
$$\text{Percent uncertainty} = \frac{t_1 - t_2}{t_1} \times 100\% = \frac{18.0 - 17.1}{18.0} \times 100\% = \frac{0.9}{18.0} \times 100\% = 5.00\%$$
</div>

**(c)** A 5% uncertainty in echo time translates to a 5% uncertainty in the perceived distance to the prey. For a target 3.00 m away, this represents an uncertainty of about 15 cm (0.15 m). This could definitely cause difficulties for the bat if it relied on a single echo measurement. Since a bat is typically 5-10 cm in length and catches insects with its mouth or wing membranes, an error of 15 cm could mean the difference between a successful catch and a miss—the bat might strike too early or too late. However, in practice, bats continuously emit sound pulses as they approach prey (often increasing the pulse rate as they close in), which allows them to update their distance measurements many times per second. This continuous tracking, combined with the bat's ability to adjust for temperature through experience or neural processing, largely eliminates the difficulties that would arise from temperature-induced speed variations. Additionally, the bat uses other cues such as the Doppler shift of echoes to determine relative motion.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates an important limitation of echolocation systems that depend on the speed of sound: environmental factors like temperature affect accuracy. The 5% variation due to a 30°C temperature difference is significant but manageable through adaptive techniques. Modern human-made sonar and ultrasound systems similarly must account for temperature variations, often by measuring the temperature directly and adjusting their calculations accordingly.

(a) The echo times are 18.0 ms at 5.00°C and 17.1 ms at 35.0°C. (b) This represents a 5.00% uncertainty. (c) While a 5% uncertainty could cause difficulties for prey capture based on a single measurement, bats overcome this by continuously tracking prey with rapid, repeated sound pulses as they approach.
