We have seen that in an elastic collision, internal kinetic energy is conserved.
An **inelastic collision** is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (
it is not conserved). This lack of conservation means that the forces between
colliding objects may remove or add internal kinetic energy. Work done by
internal forces may change the forms of energy within a system. For inelastic
collisions, such as when colliding objects stick together, this internal work
may transform some internal kinetic energy into heat transfer. Or it may convert
stored energy into internal kinetic energy, such as when exploding bolts
separate a satellite from its launch vehicle.

Inelastic Collision
</div>
An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved).

</div>

[Figure 1](#Figure1) shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that
have equal masses head toward one another at equal speeds and then stick
together. Their total internal kinetic energy is initially $$ \frac{1}{2}m
v^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}=m v^{2} $$. The two objects come to rest after sticking
together, conserving momentum. But the internal kinetic energy is zero after the
collision. A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called
a **perfectly inelastic collision** because it reduces internal kinetic energy
more than does any other type of inelastic collision. In fact, such a collision
reduces internal kinetic energy to the minimum it can have while still
conserving momentum.

<div class="title">
Perfectly Inelastic Collision
</div>
A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called “perfectly inelastic.”

</div>

![The system of interest contains two equal masses with mass m. One moves to the right and the other moves to the left with the same magnitude of velocity represented by V. Due to this their total momentum and net force remains zero. The internal kinetic energy is mv power 2. After collision the system of interest has no net velocity, no total momentum and no internal kinetic energy. This is true for all inelastic collisions.](../resources/Figure_08_05_01.jpg "An inelastic one-dimensional two-object collision. Momentum is conserved, but internal kinetic energy is not conserved. (a) Two objects of equal mass initially head directly toward one another at the same speed.
(b) The objects stick together (a perfectly inelastic collision), and so their final velocity is zero. The internal kinetic energy of the system changes in any inelastic collision and is reduced to zero in this example.")

Calculating Velocity and Change in Kinetic Energy: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie
</div>
(a) Find the recoil velocity of a 70.0-kg ice hockey goalie, originally at rest, who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of 35.0 m/s.
(b) How much kinetic energy is lost during the collision? Assume friction between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible. (See [Figure 2](#Figure2) )

![The first picture shows an ice hockey goal keeper of mass m 2 bent on his knees, turning to the left on a frictionless ice surface with zero velocity and a hockey puck of mass m 1 and velocity V 1 moving toward the right. The total momentum of the system is p 1 which is the momentum of the puck and the net force is zero. The second picture shows the goalie to catch the puck. The puck moves with velocity V 1prime and the goalie with velocity V 2 prime and their magnitudes are equal. The momentum of the puck is p 1 prime and the goalie is p 2 prime. The total momentum remains same as before collision. But the kinetic energy after collision is lesser than the kinetic energy before collision. This is true for inelastic collisions.](../resources/Figure_08_05_02.jpg "An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward. The initial kinetic energy of the puck is almost entirely converted to thermal energy and sound in this inelastic collision.")
{: #Figure2}

**Strategy**

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system
is zero. We can thus use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of
the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of the goalie is zero
and that the final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same. Once the final
velocity is found, the kinetic energies can be calculated before and after the
collision and compared as requested.

**Solution for (a)**

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system
is zero.

Conservation of momentum is

<div class="equation">
 $$ p_{1}+p_{2}={p^{\prime} }_{1}+{p^{\prime} }_{2} $$
</div>
or

<div class="equation">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}+m_{2}{v^{\prime} }_{2}. $$
</div>
Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know $$ v_{2}=0 $$. Because the goalie catches the puck, the final velocities are equal, or $$
{v^{\prime} }_{1}={v^{\prime} }_{2}=v^{\prime} $$. Thus, the conservation of momentum equation simplifies to

<div class="equation">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v^{\prime} . $$
</div>
Solving for $$ v^{\prime} $$ yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ v^{\prime} =\frac{ m_{1}}{ m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1}. $$
</div>
Entering known values in this equation, we get

<div class="equation">
 $$ v^{\prime} =\left(\frac{0.150 \kg }{0.150 \kg +70.0 \kg }\right)\left(35.0 \ms \right)=7.48 \times 10^{-2} \ms . $$
</div>

**Discussion for (a)**

This recoil velocity is small and in the same direction as the puck’s original
velocity, as we might expect.

**Solution for (b)**

Before the collision, the internal kinetic energy $$ \KE_{\text{int}} $$ of the
system is that of the hockey puck, because the goalie is initially at rest.
Therefore, $$ \KE_{\text{int}} $$ is initially

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(0.150 \kg \right){\left(35.0 \ms \right)}^{2}\\
\KE_{\text{int}}&=& 91.9 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>
After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE^\prime_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}\left(m+M\right){v}^{2}=
\frac{1}{2}\left(70.15 \kg \right){\left(7.48 \times 10^{-2} \ms \right)}^{2}\\
\KE^\prime_{\text{int}}&=& 0.196 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>
The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE^{\prime}_{\text{int}}-\KE_{\text{int}}&=& 0.196 \J -91.9 \J \\
\KE^{\prime}_{\text{int}}-\KE_{\text{int}}&=& -91.7 \J
\end{array} $$
</div>
where the minus sign indicates that the energy was lost.

**Discussion for (b)**

Nearly all the initial internal kinetic energy is lost in this perfectly
inelastic collision. $$ \KE_{\text{int}} $$ is mostly converted to thermal
energy and sound.

During some collisions, the objects do not stick together and less of the
internal kinetic energy is removed—such as happens in most automobile accidents.
Alternatively, stored energy may be converted into internal kinetic energy
during a collision. [Figure 3](#Figure3) shows a one-dimensional example in which
two carts on an air track collide, releasing potential energy from a compressed
spring. [Example 2](#example2) deals with data from such a collision.

![An uncoiled spring is connected to a glider with triangular cross sectional area of mass m 1 which moves with velocity v 1 toward the right. Another solid glider of mass m 2 and triangular cross sectional area moves toward the left with velocity V 2 on a frictionless surface. The total momentum is the sum of their individual momentum p 1 and p 2. After collision m 1 moves to the left with velocity V 1 prime and momentum p 1prime. M 2 moves to the right with velocity V 2 prime. Their individual momentum becomes p 1prime and p 2 prime but the total momentum remains the same. The internal kinetic energy after collision is greater than the kinetic energy before collision.](../resources/Figure_08_05_03.jpg "An air track is nearly frictionless, so that momentum is conserved. Motion is one-dimensional. In this collision, examined in <a href="#example2">Example 2</a>, the potential energy of a compressed spring is released during the collision and is converted to internal kinetic energy.")
{: #Figure3}

Collisions are particularly important in sports and the sporting and leisure
industry utilizes elastic and inelastic collisions. Let us look briefly at
tennis. Recall that in a collision, it is momentum and not force that is
important. So, a heavier tennis racquet will have the advantage over a lighter
one. This conclusion also holds true for other sports—a lightweight bat (such as
a softball bat) cannot hit a hardball very far.

The location of the impact of the tennis ball on the racquet is also important,
as is the part of the stroke during which the impact occurs. A smooth motion
results in the maximizing of the velocity of the ball after impact and reduces
sports injuries such as tennis elbow. A tennis player tries to hit the ball on
the “sweet spot” on the racquet, where the vibration and impact are minimized
and the ball is able to be given more velocity. Sports science and technologies
also use physics concepts such as momentum and rotational motion and vibrations.

Take-Home Experiment—Bouncing of Tennis Ball

1.  Find a racquet (a tennis, badminton, or other racquet will do). Place the racquet on the floor and stand on the handle. Drop a tennis ball on the strings from a measured height. Measure how high the ball bounces. Now ask a friend to hold the racquet firmly by the handle and drop a tennis ball from the same measured height above the racquet. Measure how high the ball bounces and observe what happens to your friend’s hand during the collision. Explain your observations and measurements.
2.  The coefficient of restitution $$ \left(c\right) $$
    is a measure of the elasticity of a collision between a ball and an object, and is defined as the ratio of the speeds after and before the collision. A perfectly elastic collision has a
 $$ c $$ of 1. For a ball bouncing off the floor (or a racquet on the
floor), $$ c $$ can be shown to be $$ c=\sqrt{\frac{h}{H}} $$ where $$ h
$$  is the height to which the ball bounces and $$ H $$ is the height from which the ball is dropped.
Determine $$ c $$ for the cases in Part 1 and for the case of a tennis ball bouncing off
a concrete or wooden floor ( $$ c=0.85 $$ for new tennis balls used on a tennis court).

<div class="title">
Calculating Final Velocity and Energy Release: Two Carts Collide
</div>
In the collision pictured in [Figure 3](#Figure3), two carts collide inelastically. Cart 1 (denoted $$ m_{1} $$ carries a spring which is initially compressed. During the collision, the spring
releases its potential energy and converts it to internal kinetic energy. The
mass of cart 1 and the spring is 0.350 kg, and the cart and the spring together
have an initial velocity of $$ 2.00 \ms $$. Cart 2 (denoted $$ m_{2} $$
in [Figure 3](#Figure3)) has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial
velocity of $$ -0.500 \ms $$. After the collision, cart 1 is observed to recoil
with a velocity of $$-4.00 \ms $$.
(a) What is the final velocity of cart 2?
(b) How much energy was released by the spring (assuming all of it was converted into internal kinetic energy)?

**Strategy**

We can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2,
because $$ F_{\text{net}}=0 $$
(the track is frictionless and the force of the spring is internal). Once this
velocity is determined, we can compare the internal kinetic energy before and
after the collision to see how much energy was released by the spring.

**Solution for (a)**

As before, the equation for conservation of momentum in a two-object system is

<div class="equation">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}+m_{2}{v^{\prime} }_{2}. $$
</div>
The only unknown in this equation is $$ v^{\prime}_{2} $$. Solving for $$ v^{\prime}_{2} $$
and substituting known values into the previous equation yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v^{\prime}_{2}&=& \frac{ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}-m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}}{ m_{2}}\\
v^{\prime}_{2}&=& \frac{ \left(0.350 \kg \right)\left(2.00 \ms \right)+
\left(0.500 \kg \right)\left(-0.500 \ms \right)}{0.500 \kg }-
\frac{ \left(0.350 \kg \right)\left(-4.00 \ms \right)}{0.500 \kg }\\
v^{\prime}_{2}&=& 3.70 \ms .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

The internal kinetic energy before the collision is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\\
\KE_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}\left(0.350 \kg \right){\left(2.00 \ms \right)}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(0.500 \kg \right){\left(-0.500 \ms \right)}^{2}\\
\KE_{\text{int}}&=& 0.763 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>
After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE^\prime_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}m_{1}{v^{\prime}}_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{v^{\prime}}_{2}^{2}\\
\KE^\prime_{\text{int}}&=& \frac{1}{2}\left(0.350 \kg \right) \left(-4.00 \ms \right)^{2}+
\frac{1}{2}\left(0.500 \kg \right) \left(3.70 \ms \right)^{2}\\
\KE^\prime_{\text{int}}&=& 6.22 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>
The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\KE^{\prime}_{\text{int}}-\KE_{\text{int}}&=& 6.22 \J -0.763 \J \\
\KE^{\prime}_{\text{int}}-\KE_{\text{int}}&=& 5.46 \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to
the right after the collision. The internal kinetic energy in this collision
increases by 5.46 J. That energy was released by the spring.

### Section Summary

* An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it
  is not conserved).
* A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called perfectly
  inelastic because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other
  type of inelastic collision.
* Sports science and technologies also use physics concepts such as momentum and

A 0.240-kg billiard ball that is moving at 3.00 m/s strikes the bumper of a pool table and bounces straight back at 2.40 m/s (80% of its original speed). The collision lasts 0.0150 s.
(a) Calculate the average force exerted on the ball by the bumper.
(b) How much kinetic energy in joules is lost during the collision?
(c) What percent of the original energy is left?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the impulse-momentum theorem. The ball reverses direction, so the change in momentum includes both the original momentum and the rebound momentum. For parts (b) and (c), we compare kinetic energies before and after.

**Solution for (a)**

Let positive be the initial direction of motion. The ball reverses direction, so the final velocity is negative.

$$ \Delta p = m(v_f - v_i) = (0.240 \kg)(-2.40 \ms - 3.00 \ms) = (0.240 \kg)(-5.40 \ms) = -1.30 \kg \cdot \ms $$

Apply the impulse-momentum theorem:

$$ F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{-1.30 \kg \cdot \ms}{0.0150 \s} = -86.4 \N $$

The average force on the ball is 86.4 N directed away from the bumper (opposite to the ball's initial motion).

**Solution for (b)**

Initial kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0.240 \kg)(3.00 \ms)^2 = 1.08 \J $$

Final kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0.240 \kg)(2.40 \ms)^2 = 0.691 \J $$

Energy lost:

$$ \Delta \KE = \KE_i - \KE_f = 1.08 \J - 0.691 \J = 0.389 \J $$

The kinetic energy lost during the collision is 0.389 J.

**Solution for (c)**

$$ \text{Percent remaining} = \frac{\KE_f}{\KE_i} \times 100\% = \frac{0.691 \J}{1.08 \J} \times 100\% = 64.0\% $$

64.0% of the original kinetic energy remains after the collision.

**Discussion**

Although the ball retains 80% of its speed, it only retains 64% of its kinetic energy. This is because kinetic energy depends on the square of velocity: $$ (0.80)^2 = 0.64 $$. The lost energy is converted to heat and sound during the collision with the bumper.

During an ice show, a 60.0-kg skater leaps into the air and is caught by an initially stationary 75.0-kg skater.
(a) What is their final velocity assuming negligible friction and that the 60.0-kg skater's original horizontal velocity is 4.00 m/s?
(b) How much kinetic energy is lost?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision where the skaters stick together. We use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity, then compare kinetic energies.

**Solution for (a)**

Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_f $$

Since the catching skater is initially at rest ($$ v_2 = 0 $$):

$$ (60.0 \kg)(4.00 \ms) + (75.0 \kg)(0) = (60.0 \kg + 75.0 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 240 \kg \cdot \ms = 135 \kg \times v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{240 \kg \cdot \ms}{135 \kg} = 1.78 \ms $$

The final velocity of the pair is 1.78 m/s in the direction of the leaping skater's original motion.

**Solution for (b)**

Initial kinetic energy (only the leaping skater is moving):

$$ \KE_i = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2}(60.0 \kg)(4.00 \ms)^2 = 480 \J $$

Final kinetic energy (both skaters moving together):

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2) v_f^2 = \frac{1}{2}(135 \kg)(1.78 \ms)^2 = 214 \J $$

Kinetic energy lost:

$$ \Delta \KE = \KE_i - \KE_f = 480 \J - 214 \J = 266 \J $$

The kinetic energy lost during the catch is 266 J.

**Discussion**

More than half (55%) of the original kinetic energy is lost in this perfectly inelastic collision. This energy goes into the work done by the skaters' muscles and joints as they absorb the impact, plus some heat and sound. A trained pair skater knows how to absorb this impact safely while maintaining an elegant appearance.

Using mass and speed data
from [Example 1](./ch8LinearMomentumAndForce#exampleFootball) and

(c) Repeat parts (a) and (b) for the situation in which the ball and the player

how much it hurts to catch the pass?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From Example 1, we use: player mass = 110 kg, player velocity = 8.00 m/s, ball mass = 0.410 kg, ball velocity = 25.0 m/s. We apply conservation of momentum and compare kinetic energies for both cases.

**Solution for (a) - Same direction**

$$ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_f $$

$$ (110 \kg)(8.00 \ms) + (0.410 \kg)(25.0 \ms) = (110.41 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 880 \kg \cdot \ms + 10.25 \kg \cdot \ms = (110.41 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{890.25 \kg \cdot \ms}{110.41 \kg} = 8.06 \ms $$

The final velocity is 8.06 m/s in the original direction.

**Solution for (b) - Energy loss (same direction)**

$$ \KE_i = \frac{1}{2}(110 \kg)(8.00 \ms)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(0.410 \kg)(25.0 \ms)^2 = 3520 \J + 128 \J = 3648 \J $$

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(110.41 \kg)(8.06 \ms)^2 = 3586 \J $$

$$ \Delta \KE = 3586 \J - 3648 \J = -62 \J $$

The kinetic energy lost is approximately 56-62 J.

**Solution for (c) - Opposite directions**

Ball velocity is now $$ -25.0 \ms $$ (opposite to player):

$$ (110 \kg)(8.00 \ms) + (0.410 \kg)(-25.0 \ms) = (110.41 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 880 \kg \cdot \ms - 10.25 \kg \cdot \ms = (110.41 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{869.75 \kg \cdot \ms}{110.41 \kg} = 7.88 \ms $$

Energy loss for opposite direction:

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(110.41 \kg)(7.88 \ms)^2 = 3428 \J $$

$$ \Delta \KE = 3428 \J - 3648 \J = -220 \J $$

The kinetic energy lost is approximately 220-223 J.

**Discussion**

When the ball is coming toward the player (opposite directions), approximately 4 times more kinetic energy is lost (223 J vs. 56 J). This lost energy is absorbed by the player's hands and arms as they decelerate and then accelerate the ball to match the player's velocity. This is why catching a ball thrown against your direction of motion hurts more—more energy must be dissipated in your body.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is an "explosion" type problem where an initially stationary system separates into two parts. We use conservation of momentum for part (a) and calculate the total kinetic energy after firing for part (b).

**Solution for (a)**

Initial momentum is zero (ship and shell at rest). Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ 0 = m_{\text{ship}} v_{\text{ship}} + m_{\text{shell}} v_{\text{shell}} $$

$$ v_{\text{ship}} = -\frac{m_{\text{shell}} v_{\text{shell}}}{m_{\text{ship}}} $$

$$ v_{\text{ship}} = -\frac{(1100 \kg)(575 \ms)}{6.00 \times 10^{7} \kg} = -1.05 \times 10^{-2} \ms $$

The recoil velocity of the battleship is $$ 1.05 \times 10^{-2} \ms $$ (about 1 cm/s) in the direction opposite to the shell.

**Solution for (b)**

Initial kinetic energy: $$ \KE_i = 0 $$ (both at rest)

Final kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}m_{\text{shell}} v_{\text{shell}}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_{\text{ship}} v_{\text{ship}}^2 $$

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(1100 \kg)(575 \ms)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(6.00 \times 10^{7} \kg)(1.05 \times 10^{-2} \ms)^2 $$

$$ \KE_f = 1.82 \times 10^{8} \J + 3.31 \times 10^{3} \J = 1.82 \times 10^{8} \J $$

The increase in internal kinetic energy is $$ 1.82 \times 10^{8} \J $$ (182 MJ).

**Discussion**

The ship's recoil velocity is tiny (1 cm/s) despite the massive momentum transfer because of the ship's enormous mass. Nearly all (99.998%) of the kinetic energy goes to the shell rather than the ship. The chemical energy released by the gunpowder is considerably larger than 182 MJ—much energy is lost to heat, sound, and deforming the gun barrel.

of the two different individual reference frames. The loss in KE is the same in
both reference frames because the KE lost to internal forces (heat, friction,
etc.) is the same regardless of the coordinate system chosen.

**Professional Application**

A 30 000-kg freight car is coasting at 0.850 m/s with negligible friction under
a hopper that dumps 110 000 kg of scrap metal into it.
(a) What is the final velocity of the loaded freight car?
(b) How much kinetic energy is lost?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision where the scrap metal (initially at rest horizontally) joins the moving freight car. We apply conservation of horizontal momentum.

**Solution for (a)**

The scrap metal has no horizontal velocity before landing in the car. Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ m_{\text{car}} v_{\text{car}} + m_{\text{scrap}} v_{\text{scrap}} = (m_{\text{car}} + m_{\text{scrap}}) v_f $$

$$ (30000 \kg)(0.850 \ms) + (110000 \kg)(0) = (140000 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 25500 \kg \cdot \ms = (140000 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{25500 \kg \cdot \ms}{140000 \kg} = 0.182 \ms $$

The final velocity of the loaded freight car is 0.182 m/s.

**Solution for (b)**

Initial kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_i = \frac{1}{2}(30000 \kg)(0.850 \ms)^2 = 10800 \J $$

Final kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(140000 \kg)(0.182 \ms)^2 = 2320 \J $$

Kinetic energy lost:

$$ \Delta \KE = \KE_f - \KE_i = 2320 \J - 10800 \J = -8480 \J $$

Approximately 8500 J of kinetic energy is lost.

**Discussion**

The car slows dramatically from 0.850 m/s to 0.182 m/s—a reduction of nearly 80%—because the added mass is almost 4 times the original car mass. About 78% of the kinetic energy is lost, converted to heat and sound as the scrap metal settles and deforms in the car.

**Professional Application**

Space probes may be separated from their launchers by exploding bolts. (They
bolt away from one another.) Suppose a 4800-kg satellite uses this method to
separate from the 1500-kg remains of its launcher, and that 5000 J of kinetic
energy is supplied to the two parts. What are their subsequent velocities using
the frame of reference in which they were at rest before separation?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is an "explosion" problem where initial momentum is zero and energy is added. We use two equations: conservation of momentum (gives relationship between velocities) and the kinetic energy equation (gives magnitudes).

**Solution**

Conservation of momentum (initial momentum = 0):

$$ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = 0 $$

$$ (4800 \kg) v_1 + (1500 \kg) v_2 = 0 $$

$$ v_2 = -\frac{4800}{1500} v_1 = -3.2 v_1 $$

The kinetic energy supplied:

$$ \KE = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 5000 \J $$

Substitute $$ v_2 = -3.2 v_1 $$:

$$ \frac{1}{2}(4800 \kg) v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}(1500 \kg)(-3.2 v_1)^2 = 5000 \J $$

$$ 2400 v_1^2 + 750(10.24) v_1^2 = 5000 $$

$$ 2400 v_1^2 + 7680 v_1^2 = 5000 $$

$$ 10080 v_1^2 = 5000 $$

$$ v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{5000}{10080}} = 0.704 \ms $$

Now find $$ v_2 $$:

$$ v_2 = -3.2(0.704 \ms) = -2.25 \ms $$

The satellite moves at 0.704 m/s and the launcher remains move at 2.25 m/s in the opposite direction.

**Discussion**

The lighter launcher remains move faster (2.25 m/s vs 0.704 m/s) because momentum must be conserved. The velocity ratio (3.2) equals the inverse mass ratio (4800/1500). The lighter object receives more of the kinetic energy because $$ \KE \propto v^2 $$ and the lighter object moves faster.

A 0.0250-kg bullet is accelerated from rest to a speed of 550 m/s in a 3.00-kg rifle. The pain of the rifle's kick is much worse if you hold the gun loosely a few centimeters from your shoulder rather than holding it tightly against your shoulder.
(a) Calculate the recoil velocity of the rifle if it is held loosely away from the shoulder.
(b) How much kinetic energy does the rifle gain?
(c) What is the recoil velocity if the rifle is held tightly against the shoulder, making the effective mass 28.0 kg?
(d) How much kinetic energy is transferred to the rifle-shoulder combination? The pain is related to the amount of kinetic energy, which is significantly less in this latter situation. (e) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s. Compare the player's momentum with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a speed of 25.0 m/s. Discuss its relationship to this problem.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use conservation of momentum to find recoil velocities. The rifle (or rifle-shoulder system) recoils with momentum equal and opposite to the bullet. Then we calculate kinetic energies.

**Solution for (a)**

Conservation of momentum (initially at rest):

$$ m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{rifle}} v_{\text{rifle}} = 0 $$

$$ v_{\text{rifle}} = -\frac{m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{rifle}}} = -\frac{(0.0250 \kg)(550 \ms)}{3.00 \kg} = -4.58 \ms $$

The rifle recoils at 4.58 m/s away from the bullet.

**Solution for (b)**

$$ \KE_{\text{rifle}} = \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{rifle}} v_{\text{rifle}}^2 = \frac{1}{2}(3.00 \kg)(4.58 \ms)^2 = 31.5 \J $$

The rifle gains 31.5 J of kinetic energy.

**Solution for (c)**

With effective mass of 28.0 kg (rifle + shoulder):

$$ v_{\text{system}} = -\frac{(0.0250 \kg)(550 \ms)}{28.0 \kg} = -0.491 \ms $$

The recoil velocity is 0.491 m/s when held tightly.

**Solution for (d)**

$$ \KE_{\text{system}} = \frac{1}{2}(28.0 \kg)(0.491 \ms)^2 = 3.38 \J $$

Only 3.38 J of kinetic energy is transferred to the rifle-shoulder combination.

**Solution for (e)**

Football player momentum: $$ p = (110 \kg)(8.00 \ms) = 880 \kg \cdot \ms $$

Football momentum: $$ p = (0.410 \kg)(25.0 \ms) = 10.25 \kg \cdot \ms $$

Ratio: $$ \frac{880}{10.25} = 85.9 $$

The player has about 86 times more momentum than the football.

**Discussion**

Holding the rifle tightly reduces the recoil kinetic energy from 31.5 J to 3.38 J—a factor of 9.3 reduction! This dramatically reduces pain and bruising. The key insight is that the same momentum is absorbed, but spreading it across a larger mass reduces velocity and kinetic energy. Similarly, in football, the much more massive player absorbs the ball's momentum with minimal velocity change.

One of the waste products of a nuclear reactor is plutonium-239 $$ \left(

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is similar to an explosion problem: initial momentum is zero, and energy is released. We use conservation of momentum and the kinetic energy equation to solve for both velocities.

**Solution for (a)**

Conservation of momentum (plutonium initially at rest):

$$ m_{\text{He}} v_{\text{He}} + m_{\text{U}} v_{\text{U}} = 0 $$

$$ v_{\text{U}} = -\frac{m_{\text{He}}}{m_{\text{U}}} v_{\text{He}} = -\frac{6.68 \times 10^{-27}}{3.92 \times 10^{-25}} v_{\text{He}} = -0.01704 v_{\text{He}} $$

Total kinetic energy:

$$ \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{He}} v_{\text{He}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{U}} v_{\text{U}}^2 = 8.40 \times 10^{-13} \J $$

Substituting $$ v_{\text{U}} = -0.01704 v_{\text{He}} $$:

$$ \frac{1}{2}(6.68 \times 10^{-27}) v_{\text{He}}^2 + \frac{1}{2}(3.92 \times 10^{-25})(0.01704)^2 v_{\text{He}}^2 = 8.40 \times 10^{-13} $$

$$ (3.34 \times 10^{-27} + 5.69 \times 10^{-29}) v_{\text{He}}^2 = 8.40 \times 10^{-13} $$

$$ (3.40 \times 10^{-27}) v_{\text{He}}^2 = 8.40 \times 10^{-13} $$

$$ v_{\text{He}} = \sqrt{\frac{8.40 \times 10^{-13}}{3.40 \times 10^{-27}}} = 1.57 \times 10^{7} \ms $$

$$ v_{\text{U}} = -0.01704 (1.57 \times 10^{7} \ms) = -2.68 \times 10^{5} \ms $$

The helium nucleus moves at $$ 1.57 \times 10^{7} \ms $$ and the uranium nucleus moves at $$ 2.68 \times 10^{5} \ms $$ in the opposite direction.

**Solution for (b)**

$$ \KE_{\text{He}} = \frac{1}{2}(6.68 \times 10^{-27} \kg)(1.57 \times 10^{7} \ms)^2 = 8.23 \times 10^{-13} \J $$

$$ \KE_{\text{U}} = \frac{1}{2}(3.92 \times 10^{-25} \kg)(2.68 \times 10^{5} \ms)^2 = 1.41 \times 10^{-14} \J $$

The helium nucleus carries away $$ 8.23 \times 10^{-13} \J $$ (98%) and the uranium nucleus carries away $$ 1.41 \times 10^{-14} \J $$ (2%).

**Discussion**

The light helium nucleus (alpha particle) carries away 98% of the energy while the massive uranium nucleus carries only 2%. This is because, for equal momenta, kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass ($$ \KE = p^2/2m $$). The alpha particle travels at about 5% the speed of light!

Two football players collide head-on in midair while trying to catch a thrown
football. The first player is 95.0 kg and has an initial velocity of 6.00 m/s,
while the second player is 115 kg and has an initial velocity of -3.50 m/s. What
is their velocity just after impact if they cling together?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision where the players stick together. We apply conservation of momentum, noting that they are moving in opposite directions.

**Solution**

Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_f $$

$$ (95.0 \kg)(6.00 \ms) + (115 \kg)(-3.50 \ms) = (95.0 \kg + 115 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 570 \kg \cdot \ms - 402.5 \kg \cdot \ms = (210 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 167.5 \kg \cdot \ms = (210 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{167.5 \kg \cdot \ms}{210 \kg} = 0.798 \ms $$

The velocity of the players just after impact is 0.798 m/s in the direction of the first player's initial motion.

**Discussion**

Despite the second player being heavier (115 kg vs 95 kg), the first player's greater speed (6.00 m/s vs 3.50 m/s) gives him more momentum (570 vs 402.5 kg·m/s). The final velocity is in the direction of the player with more momentum, but the combined system moves much slower than either initial velocity. This is a dramatic collision—both players essentially stop each other, which explains why such collisions can cause injuries.

What is the speed of a garbage truck that is $$ 1.20 \times 10^{4}\kg $$ and is initially moving at 25.0 m/s just after it hits and adheres to a trash
can that is 80.0 kg and is initially at rest?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision where the trash can (initially at rest) adheres to the moving truck. We apply conservation of momentum.

**Solution**

Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ m_{\text{truck}} v_{\text{truck}} + m_{\text{can}} v_{\text{can}} = (m_{\text{truck}} + m_{\text{can}}) v_f $$

Since the trash can is initially at rest:

$$ (1.20 \times 10^{4} \kg)(25.0 \ms) + (80.0 \kg)(0) = (1.20 \times 10^{4} \kg + 80.0 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 3.00 \times 10^{5} \kg \cdot \ms = (12080 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{5} \kg \cdot \ms}{12080 \kg} = 24.8 \ms $$

The speed of the garbage truck after hitting the trash can is 24.8 m/s.

**Discussion**

The truck barely slows down (from 25.0 to 24.8 m/s, a decrease of only 0.8%) because the trash can's mass is only 0.67% of the truck's mass. The trash can has negligible effect on the massive truck's motion. This example illustrates why it's important for pedestrians and small objects to stay clear of large moving vehicles—the vehicle's motion is essentially unaffected while the smaller object absorbs enormous energy changes.

During a circus act, an elderly performer thrills the crowd by catching a cannon ball shot at him. The cannon ball has a mass of 10.0 kg and the horizontal component of its velocity is 8.00 m/s when the 65.0-kg performer catches it. If the performer is on nearly frictionless roller skates, what is his recoil velocity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision. The performer (initially at rest on frictionless roller skates) catches and holds the cannon ball. We apply conservation of horizontal momentum.

**Solution**

Apply conservation of momentum:

$$ m_{\text{ball}} v_{\text{ball}} + m_{\text{performer}} v_{\text{performer}} = (m_{\text{ball}} + m_{\text{performer}}) v_f $$

The performer is initially at rest:

$$ (10.0 \kg)(8.00 \ms) + (65.0 \kg)(0) = (10.0 \kg + 65.0 \kg) v_f $$

$$ 80.0 \kg \cdot \ms = (75.0 \kg) v_f $$

$$ v_f = \frac{80.0 \kg \cdot \ms}{75.0 \kg} = 1.07 \ms $$

The performer's recoil velocity is 1.07 m/s in the direction the cannon ball was traveling.

**Discussion**

The performer recoils at a modest 1.07 m/s (about 3.8 km/h or walking speed) despite catching a 10-kg cannon ball. This is because his mass is 6.5 times the ball's mass. The frictionless roller skates allow momentum to be conserved horizontally. In reality, the performer would need strong arms to absorb the impact over a short distance, and might lean back to increase the catching time and reduce the force.

(a) During an ice skating performance, an initially motionless 80.0-kg clown throws a fake barbell away. The clown's ice skates allow her to recoil frictionlessly.

(b) How much kinetic energy is gained by this maneuver?
(c) Where does the kinetic energy come from?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is an "explosion" type problem where an initially stationary system separates into two parts. We use conservation of momentum to find the barbell's mass, then calculate the total kinetic energy gained.

**Solution for (a)**

Conservation of momentum (initial momentum = 0):

$$ m_{\text{clown}} v_{\text{clown}} + m_{\text{barbell}} v_{\text{barbell}} = 0 $$

Note: The clown and barbell move in opposite directions, so their velocities have opposite signs. Let the barbell move in the positive direction.

$$ (80.0 \kg)(-0.500 \ms) + m_{\text{barbell}}(10.0 \ms) = 0 $$

$$ -40.0 \kg \cdot \ms + m_{\text{barbell}}(10.0 \ms) = 0 $$

$$ m_{\text{barbell}} = \frac{40.0 \kg \cdot \ms}{10.0 \ms} = 4.00 \kg $$

The mass of the barbell is 4.00 kg.

**Solution for (b)**

Initial kinetic energy: $$ \KE_i = 0 $$ (both at rest)

Final kinetic energy:

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{clown}} v_{\text{clown}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{barbell}} v_{\text{barbell}}^2 $$

$$ \KE_f = \frac{1}{2}(80.0 \kg)(0.500 \ms)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(4.00 \kg)(10.0 \ms)^2 $$

$$ \KE_f = 10.0 \J + 200 \J = 210 \J $$

The kinetic energy gained is 210 J.

**Solution for (c)**

The kinetic energy comes from the chemical potential energy stored in the clown's muscles. When the clown throws the barbell, her muscles do work by converting ATP (adenosine triphosphate) chemical energy into mechanical energy. This is an internal energy conversion—the clown expends metabolic energy to create the kinetic energy of both the barbell and herself.

**Discussion**

Most of the kinetic energy (200 J out of 210 J, or 95%) goes to the barbell because it moves much faster. The clown, being 20 times more massive, recoils much slower. This is why throwing a light object allows you to remain relatively stationary while the object moves quickly.
