* Describe the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.
* Explain why the inevitable conversion of energy to less useful forms makes it necessary to conserve energy resources.

</div>

Energy is an important ingredient in all phases of society. We live in a very
interdependent world, and access to adequate and reliable energy resources is
crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives. But
current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. About
40% of the world’s energy comes from oil, and much of that goes to
transportation uses. Oil prices are dependent as much upon new (or foreseen)
discoveries as they are upon political events and situations around the world.
The U.S., with 4.5% of the world’s population, consumes 24% of the world’s oil
production per year; 66% of that oil is imported!

### Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources

The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1).
The fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil, although
natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. **Renewable forms of
energy** are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar,
and biomass. About 85% of our energy comes from nonrenewable
**fossil fuels**—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global
warming and fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through
combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil
fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy.

![A pie chart of the world&#x2019;s energy consumption by source is shown. Thirty-five point four three percent is petroleum, twenty-eight point one five percent is coal, twenty-three point four six percent is dry natural gas, six point two seven percent is hydro-electricity, five point seven nine percent is nuclear electricity, point eight six percent is geothermal, wind, solar, biomass, and point zero five percent is geothermal, biomass, or solar energy not used for electricity.](../resources/svg/Figure_07_09_01.svg "World energy consumption (2018) based on data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy (credit:Veillette)")
{ #Figure1}

### The World’s Growing Energy Needs

World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing
countries. ( See [Figure 2](#Figure2).)
Global demand for energy has tripled in the past 50 years and might triple again
in the next 30 years. While much of this growth will come from the rapidly
booming economies of China and India, many of the developed countries,
especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet their energy needs by expanding
the use of renewable sources. Although presently only a small percentage,
renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind energy. For example,
Germany plans to meet 65% of its electricity and 30% of its overall energy needs
with renewable resources by the year 2030. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid economic growth
of China and India. In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest
consumer of oil. However, over 1/3 of this is imported. Unlike most Western
countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of China, accounting
for 2/3 of its energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the United States as
the largest generator of $$ \text{CO}_{2} $$. In India, the main energy
resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil is imported.
About 70% of India’s electricity is generated by highly polluting coal. Yet
there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India has a rapidly
growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program in the
world. China has invested substantially in building solar collection farms as well as hydroelectric plants.

![A bar graph depicting world energy consumption is shown. The year is listed on the horizontal axis and energy consumed is listed on the vertical axis. Energy consumption by the world is shown for different years. Energy consumption rises over time. In the year nineteen hundred and ninety it was three hundred seventy three multiplied by ten to the power eighteen joules, and the projection is that it will become eight hundred twelve multiplied by ten to the power eighteen joules by the year twenty thirty five.](../resources/Figure_07_09_02a.jpg "Past and projected world energy use (source: Based on data from U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021)")

{ #Figure3}

[Table 1](#Table1) displays the 2020 commercial energy mix by country for some
of the prime energy users in the world. While non-renewable sources dominate,
some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity from renewable
resources. For example, about two-thirds of New Zealand’s electricity demand is 
met by hydroelectric. Only 10% of the U.S. electricity is generated by renewable
resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to determine total sources 
and consumers of energy in many countries, and estimates vary somewhat by data source and type of measurement.

### Energy and Economic Well-being

The last two columns in this table examine the energy and electricity use per
capita. Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries
higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (gross domestic product) per
capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is
borne out in [Figure 4](#Figure4). Increased efficiency of energy use will change
this dependency. A global problem is balancing energy resource development
against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction and use.

New and diversified energy sources do, however, greatly increase economic opportunity and stability. First, the extensive employment opportunities in renewable energy make it one of the most sustainable and secure fields to enter. Second, renewable energy provides countries and localities with increased levels of resiliency in the face of natural disasters, conflict, or other disruptions. The 21st century has already seen major economic impacts from energy disruptions: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, various wildfires, Hurricane Maria, and the 2021 Texas Winter Storm demonstrate the vulnerability of United States power systems. Diversifying energy sources through renewables and other fossil-fuel alternatives brings power grids and transportation systems back online much more quickly, saving lives and enabling a more swift return to economic operations. And as critical emerging information infrastructure, such as data centers, requires more of the world's energy, supplying those growing systems during normal operations and crises will be increasingly important.

### Conserving Energy

As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some
distinctions between two sometimes misunderstood terms in the area of energy
use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of energy” is
a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that
cannot be proven from basic principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device,
and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of
energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this
principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important philosophy of
energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount
of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g.,
turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing
conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task—such as
developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater
miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc.

Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one
might wonder why we need to be concerned about our energy resources, since
energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of most
energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion
to energy forms no longer useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the
potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy
transformation.

### Section Summary

* The relative use of different fuels to provide energy has changed over the
  years, but fuel use is currently dominated by oil, although natural gas and
  solar contributions are increasing.
* Although non-renewable sources dominate, some countries meet a sizeable
  percentage of their electricity needs from renewable resources.
* The United States obtains only about 10% of its energy from renewable sources,
  mostly hydroelectric power.
* Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher
  standards of living, as measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita,
  are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita.
* Even though, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, energy can
  never be created or destroyed, energy that can be used to do work is always
  partly converted to less useful forms, such as waste heat to the environment,
  in all of our uses of energy for practical purposes.
