* Make reasonable approximations based on given data.
</div>

On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make
**approximations** or “guesstimates” for a particular quantity. What is the
distance to a certain destination? What is the approximate density of a given
item? About how large a current will there be in a circuit? Many approximate
numbers are based on formulae in which the input quantities are known only to a
limited accuracy. As you develop problem-solving skills (that can be applied to
a variety of fields through a study of physics), you will also develop skills at
approximating. You will develop these skills through thinking more
quantitatively, and by being willing to take risks. As with any endeavor,
experience helps, as well as familiarity with units. These approximations allow
us to rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic numbers. Approximations also
allow us to challenge others and guide us in our approaches to our scientific
world. Let us do two examples to illustrate this concept.

<div class="example" markdown="1">

Approximate the Height of a Building
</div>
Can you approximate the height of one of the buildings on your campus, or in your neighborhood? Let us make an approximation based upon the height of a person. In this example, we will calculate the height of a 39-story building.

**Strategy**

Think about the average height of an adult male. We can approximate the height
of the building by scaling up from the height of a person.

**Solution**

Based on information in the example, we know there are 39 stories in the
building. If we use the fact that the height of one story is approximately equal
to about the length of two adult humans (each human is about 2-m tall), then we
can estimate the total height of the building to be

<div class="equation">
  $$ \frac{2 \m }{1 \text{person}}×\frac{2 \text{person}}{1 \text{story}}× 39\text{stories}
= 156 \m .  $$
</div>

**Discussion**

You can use known quantities to determine an approximate measurement of unknown
quantities. If your hand measures 10 cm across, how many hand lengths equal the
width of your desk? What other measurements can you approximate besides length?

Approximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars
</div>
![A bank stack containing one hundred hundred-dollar bills.](../resources/Figure_01_04_01.jpg "A bank stack contains one-hundred  \$100 bills, and is worth  \$10 000. How many bank stacks make up a trillion dollars? (credit: Andrew Magill)"){: #Figure1}

The U.S. federal deficit in the 2019 fiscal year was a little greater than $$ 1
trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much even one trillion
actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in \$100 bills. If
you made 100-bill stacks and used them to evenly cover a football field (between
the end zones), make an approximation of how high the money pile would become. (
We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are
measured in yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft.
What do you think?

**Strategy**

When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks
of 100 wrapped $$100 bills, such as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since
this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the
volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion
dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field
multiplied by the unknown height.

**Solution**

(1) Calculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single
bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A stack of 100 of these is about 0.5 in.
thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is:

<div class="equation">
  $$ \begin{array}{}
\text{volume of stack}=\text{length}×\text{width}×\text{height} \text{,} \\
\text{volume of stack}=6 \text{in.}×3 \text{in.}\times 0.5 \text{in.},\\
\text{volume of stack}=9 \text{in.}^{3} .
\end{array}  $$
</div>
(2) Calculate the number of stacks. Note that a trillion dollars is equal to  $$ \$1\times 10^{12} , $$
and a stack of one-hundred  \$100 bills is equal to  \$10 000, 
or  $$  \$1\times 10^{4}  $$. The number of stacks you will have is:

<div class="equation">
  $$ \frac{ \$1 \times 10^{12}  \left( \text{ a trillion dollars } \right)}{1 \times 10^{4} \$ \text{per stack} } =1\times 10^{8}\text{stacks.}  $$
</div>
(3) Calculate the area of a football field in square inches. The area of a football field is
 $$ 100 \text{yd} \times 50 \text{yd} \text{,}   $$
which gives  $$ 5000 \text{yd}^{2}.  $$
Because we are working in inches, we need to convert square yards to square
inches:

<div class="equation">
  $$ \begin{array}{}
\text{Area}=5 000 \text{yd}^{2}×\frac{3\text{ft}}{1 \text{yd}} \times
\frac{3\text{ft}}{1 \text{yd}} \times \frac{12 \text{in.}}{1 \text{ft}}
\times \frac{12 \text{in.}}{1 \text{ft}}=6 480 000\text{in.}^{2},\\
\text{Area} \approx 6\times 10^{6} \text{in.}^{2}.
\end{array}  $$
</div>
This conversion gives us  $$ 6\times 10^{6}\text{in.}^{2}  $$
for the area of the field. (Note that we are using only one significant figure
in these calculations.)

(4) Calculate the total volume of the bills. The volume of all the \$100 -bill
stacks is $$ 9\text{in.}^{3}/\text{stack}\times 10^{8}\text{ stacks}=9\times
10^{8}\text{in.}^{3}. $$
(5) Calculate the height. To determine the height of the bills, use the
equation:

<div class="equation">
  $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{volume of bills}&=& \text{area of field}×\text{height of money:}\\
\text{Height of money}&=& \frac{ \text{volume of bills}}{\text{area of field}},\\
\text{Height of money}&=& \frac{9\times 10^{8}\text{in.}^{3}}{6\times 10^{6}{\text{in.}}^{2}}=1.33\times 10^{2}\text{in.,}\\
\text{Height of money}& \approx & 1\times 10^{2}\text{in.}=100 \text{in.}
\end{array}  $$
</div>
The height of the money will be about 100 in. high. Converting this value to feet gives

<div class="equation">
  $$ 100 \text{in.}×\frac{1 \text{ft}}{12 \text{in.}}=8.33 \text{ft}\approx 8 \text{ft.}  $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but
the other early estimate of 10 ft (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the
approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you in
terms of rough “guesstimates” versus carefully calculated approximations?

How many heartbeats are there in a lifetime?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

To estimate heartbeats in a lifetime, we need to estimate the average heart rate and average lifespan.

**Solution**

1. Estimate average heart rate: approximately 70 beats per minute (at rest, it varies but this is a reasonable average including sleep and activity).

2. Estimate average lifespan: approximately 80 years.

3. Calculate minutes in a lifetime:
<div class="equation">
$$ 80 \text{ years} \times \frac{365 \text{ days}}{1 \text{ year}} \times \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ day}} \times \frac{60 \text{ min}}{1 \text{ hour}} \approx 4.2 \times 10^{7} \text{ minutes} $$
</div>

4. Calculate total heartbeats:
<div class="equation">
$$ 70 \frac{\text{beats}}{\text{min}} \times 4.2 \times 10^{7} \text{ min} \approx 3 \times 10^{9} \text{ heartbeats} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This enormous number of approximately 3 billion heartbeats illustrates the remarkable endurance and reliability of the human heart as a muscle that never rests. The calculation assumes a relatively constant average heart rate of 70 bpm, though actual heart rates vary significantly with activity level, age, and health status. This order-of-magnitude estimate helps us appreciate the incredible workload the cardiovascular system handles over a lifetime, beating roughly once per second for 80 years without pause.

Sample answer: $$ 2\times 10^{9} $$ to $$ 3\times 10^{9} $$ heartbeats

A generation is about one-third of a lifetime. Approximately how many generations have passed since the year 0 AD?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Estimate the time since year 0 AD, then divide by the length of a generation.

**Solution**

1. Time since year 0 AD to present (2025):
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Time elapsed} \approx 2025 \text{ years} \approx 2000 \text{ years} $$
</div>

2. If a generation is about one-third of a lifetime, and an average lifetime is about 70-80 years:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Generation length} \approx \frac{70 \text{ years}}{3} \approx 25 \text{ years} $$
</div>

3. Number of generations:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Number of generations} = \frac{2000 \text{ years}}{25 \text{ years/generation}} = 80 \text{ generations} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The relatively small number of only 80 generations shows how recent human recorded history is when viewed from a biological perspective. This calculation assumes a generation length of approximately 25 years, though this value has varied significantly across different cultures, time periods, and socioeconomic conditions. Understanding this timescale is valuable for studying genetic inheritance, cultural transmission of knowledge, and the relatively rapid pace of human cultural evolution compared to biological evolution.

**Answer**

Approximately __80 generations__ have passed since the year 0 AD (assuming about 25 years per generation).

How many times longer than the mean life of an extremely unstable atomic
nucleus is the lifetime of a human? (Hint: The lifetime of an unstable atomic nucleus is on the order of  $$ 10^{-22} \s  $$.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to compare the human lifetime to the lifetime of an unstable atomic nucleus by finding their ratio.

**Solution**

1. From the hint, the lifetime of an unstable atomic nucleus is on the order of $$ 10^{-22} \s $$.

2. Convert human lifetime to seconds. Assuming an average human lifetime of about 70 years:
<div class="equation">
$$ 70 \text{ years} \times \frac{365 \text{ days}}{1 \text{ year}} \times \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ day}} \times \frac{3600 \s}{1 \text{ hour}} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{9} \s $$
</div>

3. Calculate the ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{\text{Human lifetime}}{\text{Nucleus lifetime}} = \frac{2.2 \times 10^{9} \s}{10^{-22} \s} \approx 2 \times 10^{31} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This truly astronomical factor of $$ 10^{31} $$ illustrates the vast range of timescales that exist in nature, from quantum processes to human experience. To put this in perspective, a human lifetime is longer than a nuclear decay timescale by the same factor that the age of the universe is longer than a fraction of a second. This extreme comparison demonstrates both the power of scientific notation in handling such disparate scales and helps us appreciate how quantum phenomena occur on timescales completely outside our everyday intuition.

Sample answer: $$ 2\times 10^{31} $$ times longer (if an average human lifetime is taken to be about 70 years).

Calculate the approximate number of atoms in a bacterium. Assume that the average mass of an atom in the bacterium is ten

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Divide the total mass of the bacterium by the average mass of an atom to find the number of atoms.

**Solution**

1. From the hint:
   - Mass of hydrogen atom: $$ m\_{H} \approx 10^{-27} \kg $$
   - Mass of bacterium: $$ m\_{bact} \approx 10^{-15} \kg $$

2. Average mass of an atom in the bacterium:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{atom} = 10 \times m_{H} = 10 \times 10^{-27} \kg = 10^{-26} \kg $$

3. Number of atoms:
<div class="equation">
$$ N = \frac{m_{bact}}{m_{atom}} = \frac{10^{-15} \kg}{10^{-26} \kg} = 10^{11} \text{ atoms} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The result of approximately 100 billion atoms reveals that even the tiniest living organisms contain an enormous number of atoms, providing ample complexity for the molecular machinery of life. This calculation assumes all atoms in the bacterium have an average mass of 10 times that of hydrogen, which is reasonable given that bacteria contain heavier atoms like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in addition to hydrogen. This order-of-magnitude estimate helps us understand why even single-celled organisms can have sophisticated metabolic pathways and genetic information storage despite their microscopic size.

**Answer**

A bacterium contains approximately __10¹¹ atoms__ (or about 100 billion atoms).

Approximately how many atoms thick is a cell membrane, assuming all atoms there average about twice the size of a hydrogen atom?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to estimate how many atoms fit across the thickness of a cell membrane, given that the atoms are about twice the size of a hydrogen atom.

**Solution**

1. A typical cell membrane thickness is approximately $$ 10^{-8} \m $$ (or about 10 nm).

2. The diameter of a hydrogen atom is approximately $$ 10^{-10} \m $$ (or about 0.1 nm).

3. If atoms in the membrane average about twice the size of a hydrogen atom:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Average atom diameter} \approx 2 \times 10^{-10} \m $$

4. Calculate the number of atoms across the membrane thickness:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Number of atoms} = \frac{\text{Membrane thickness}}{\text{Atom diameter}} = \frac{10^{-8} \m}{2 \times 10^{-10} \m} = 50 \text{ atoms} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The remarkably small thickness of only about 50 atoms demonstrates how incredibly thin cell membranes are, yet they successfully maintain the cell's integrity and control what enters and exits. This estimate assumes atoms in the membrane are roughly uniform in size at about twice the hydrogen atom diameter, which is reasonable for the lipid and protein molecules that make up biological membranes. The fact that such a thin barrier can effectively separate the cell's interior from its environment while still allowing selective transport of materials is one of the elegant solutions nature has evolved for cellular function.

Sample answer: 50 atoms

(a) What fraction of Earth's diameter is the greatest ocean depth?
(b) The greatest mountain height?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Use Table 3 to find the relevant values, then calculate the ratios.

**Solution**

From Table 3:

- Diameter of Earth: $$ d\_{Earth} = 10^{7} \m $$ (more precisely, about $$ 1.27 \times 10^{7} \m $$)
- Greatest ocean depth: $$ d\_{ocean} = 10^{4} \m $$ (about 10,000 m, or the Mariana Trench at ~11,000 m)
- Greatest mountain height: $$ h\_{mountain} = 10^{4} \m $$ (Mt. Everest is about 8,850 m)

__(a) Fraction for ocean depth:__

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Fraction} = \frac{d_{ocean}}{d_{Earth}} = \frac{10^{4} \m}{10^{7} \m} = 10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000} $$
</div>

__(b) Fraction for mountain height:__

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Fraction} = \frac{h_{mountain}}{d_{Earth}} = \frac{10^{4} \m}{10^{7} \m} = 10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tiny ratio of 1/1000 for both ocean depths and mountain heights reveals that Earth is remarkably smooth relative to its overall size—the deepest trenches and highest peaks represent only about 0.1% of Earth's diameter. This explains why our planet appears as a smooth sphere when viewed from space, with surface irregularities barely visible. To put this in perspective, if Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball, it would actually be smoother than a regulation billiard ball, since these surface features would scale down proportionally.

**Answer**

(a) The greatest ocean depth is approximately __1/1000__ (or __0.001__ or __10⁻³__) of Earth's diameter.

(b) The greatest mountain height is approximately __1/1000__ (or __0.001__ or __10⁻³__) of Earth's diameter.

Both the deepest ocean trenches and highest mountains are tiny compared to Earth's diameter, representing only about 0.1% of it.

(a) Calculate the number of cells in a hummingbird assuming the mass of an average cell is ten times the mass of a bacterium.
(b) Making the same assumption, how many cells are there in a human?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to estimate the number of cells by dividing the total mass by the mass of a single cell (which is 10 times the mass of a bacterium).

**Solution**

1. From the problem, an average cell mass is ten times the mass of a bacterium. From Table 3, the mass of a bacterium is approximately $$ 10^{-15} \kg $$, so:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Cell mass} \approx 10 \times 10^{-15} \kg = 10^{-14} \kg $$

__(a) Cells in a hummingbird:__

2. The mass of a hummingbird is approximately $$ 10^{-2} \kg $$ (about 10 grams, or roughly 0.01 kg).

3. Calculate number of cells:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Hummingbird mass}}{\text{Cell mass}} = \frac{10^{-2} \kg}{10^{-14} \kg} = 10^{12} \text{ cells} $$
</div>

__(b) Cells in a human:__

4. The mass of a human is approximately $$ 10^{2} \kg $$ (about 100 kg, though 70 kg is more typical).

5. Calculate number of cells:

$$ \text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Human mass}}{\text{Cell mass}} = \frac{10^{2} \kg}{10^{-14} \kg} = 10^{16} \text{ cells} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ratio of approximately 10,000:1 in cell count between humans and hummingbirds roughly corresponds to the ratio of their masses, which is reasonable given our assumption of uniform cell size. In reality, cell sizes vary dramatically across different tissue types (neurons, blood cells, muscle cells all differ), but this order-of-magnitude approximation remains useful for understanding biological scale. These enormous numbers—trillions for a hummingbird and ten quadrillion for a human—illustrate the incredible cellular complexity that underlies even small multicellular organisms.

Assuming one nerve impulse must end before another can begin, what is the maximum firing rate of a nerve in impulses per second?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From Table 3, find the duration of a nerve impulse, then calculate the maximum firing rate.

**Solution**

1. From Table 3, the duration of a nerve impulse is approximately $$ 10^{-3} \s $$ (or 1 millisecond).

2. If one impulse must complete before another begins, the maximum firing rate is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Firing rate} = \frac{1}{\text{Duration}} = \frac{1}{10^{-3} \s} = 10^{3} \text{ impulses/s} = 1000 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

A maximum firing rate of 1000 Hz (1000 impulses per second) represents the theoretical upper limit based on the refractory period during which a neuron cannot fire again. This calculation assumes that impulses cannot overlap and that the neuron fires immediately after each refractory period ends, which represents an idealized maximum. In biological reality, most neurons fire at rates well below this limit—typically a few hundred Hz at most—because sustained high-frequency firing would be metabolically expensive and is usually unnecessary for neural signaling.

**Answer**

The maximum firing rate of a nerve is approximately __1000 impulses per second__ (or __1000 Hz__, or __10³ Hz__).

This is consistent with known biological limits - most neurons fire at rates well below 1000 Hz, with typical maximum rates being a few hundred Hz for most neurons.
