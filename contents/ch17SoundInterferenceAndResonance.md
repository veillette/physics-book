{: #Figure1}

Interference is the hallmark of waves, all of which exhibit constructive and
destructive interference exactly analogous to that seen for water waves. In
fact, one way to prove something “is a wave” is to observe interference effects.
So, sound being a wave, we expect it to exhibit interference; we have already
mentioned a few such effects, such as the beats from two similar notes played
simultaneously.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise.
Larger-scale applications of active noise reduction by destructive interference
are contemplated for entire passenger compartments in commercial aircraft. To
obtain destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a
second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the
incoming noise. Sound waves in fluids are pressure waves and consistent with
Pascal’s principle; pressures from two different sources add and subtract like
simple numbers; that is, positive and negative gauge pressures add to a much
smaller pressure, producing a lower-intensity sound. Although completely
destructive interference is possible only under the simplest conditions, it is
possible to reduce noise levels by 30 dB or more using this technique.

![A detailed picture of headphones with all its parts labeled. It shows the noise cancellation system in both the ear plugs consisting of the noise sensor, driver, pressure servo and cushions. There is a boom mic with low frequency housing, a boom adjustment, boom and cable all attached to one side of the power input cable. The power input cable is shown to have an on/off switch.](../resources/Figure_17_05_02.jpg 'Headphones designed to cancel noise with destructive interference create a sound wave exactly opposite to the incoming sound. These headphones can be more effective than the simple passive attenuation used in most ear protection. Such headphones were used on the record-setting, around the world nonstop flight of the Voyager aircraft to protect the pilots’ hearing from engine noise.')
{: #Figure2}

Where else can we observe sound interference? All sound resonances, such as in
musical instruments, are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only
the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while
others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing
over a bottle, to the characteristic flavor of a violin’s sounding box, to the
recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and standing waves play a
vital role.

Interference
</div>
Interference is such a fundamental aspect of waves that observing interference is proof that something is a wave. The wave nature of light was established by experiments showing interference. Similarly, when electrons scattered from crystals exhibited interference, their wave nature was confirmed to be exactly as predicted by symmetry with certain wave characteristics of light.

Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other
end, as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)
, [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), and [[Figure 6]](#Figure6). If the tuning fork has
just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at
most frequencies it vibrates very little. This observation just means that the
air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a
resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance
travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If
the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the
tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with
the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected
sounds form a standing wave in the tube as shown.

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork with right arm of fork moving right and left arm moving left. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves moving across a tube from the open end to the closed end. The tip of the cone is at the open end of the tube.](../resources/Figure_17_05_03.jpg 'Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A disturbance moves down the tube.')
{: #Figure3}

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube. The tip of the cone is at the closed end of the tube, and the mouth of the cone is moving toward the open end of the tube.](../resources/Figure_17_05_04.jpg 'Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork.

{: #Figure5}

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork with its right arm moving rightward and left arm moving leftward. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube. The curve side of the cone has reached the tuning fork. The length of the tube is given to be equal to lambda divided by four.](../resources/Figure_17_05_06.jpg 'Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A graph of air displacement along the length of the tube shows none at the closed end, where the motion is constrained, and a maximum at the open end. This standing wave has one-fourth of its wavelength in the tube, so that ( \\lambda =4L ).')
{: #Figure6}

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an **antinode**) at the open end, where motion is unconstrained, and no
displacement (a **node**) at the closed end, where air movement is halted. The
distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this
equals the length of the tube; thus, $$\lambda =4L $$ . This same resonance can
be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as
shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). It is best to consider this a natural vibration
of the air column independently of how it is induced.

![A cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube is shown. A tuning fork is shown to vibrate at a small opening above the closed end of the tube. The length of the tube L is given to be equal to lambda divided by four.](../resources/Figure_17_05_07.jpg 'The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end. ')
{: #Figure7}

Given that maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at
the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the
tube, such as the one shown in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8). Here the standing wave
has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or $$L=\left(3/4\right)
\lambda^{\prime} $$ , so that $$\lambda^{\prime} =4L/3 $$ . Continuing this
process reveals a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds
that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms for the resonances in any
system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the **fundamental**, while all
higher resonant frequencies are called **overtones**. All resonant frequencies
are integral multiples of the fundamental, and they are collectively called **harmonics**. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the
second harmonic, and so on. [[Figure 9]](#Figure9) shows the fundamental and the
first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end.

![A cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube is shown as a wave. There is three-fourth of the wave inside the tube and one-fourth outside shown as dotted curve. The length of the tube is given as three-fourth times lambda prime.](../resources/Figure_17_05_08.jpg 'Another resonance for a tube closed at one end. This has maximum air displacements at the open end, and none at the closed end. The wavelength is shorter, with three-fourths ( \\lambda^\\prime) equaling the length of the tube, so that ( \\lambda^\\prime =4L/3 ) . This higher-frequency vibration is the first overtone.')
{: #Figure8}

![There are four tubes, each of which is closed at one end. Each tube has resonance waves reflected at the closed end. In the first tube, marked Fundamental, the wavelength is long and only one-fourth of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the second tube, marked First overtone, the wavelength is slightly shorter and three-fourths of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the third tube, marked Second overtone, the wavelength is still shorter and one and one-fourth of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the fourth tube, marked Third overtone, the wavelength is shorter than the others, and one and three-fourths of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end.](../resources/Figure_17_05_09.jpg 'The fundamental and three lowest overtones for a tube closed at one end. All have maximum air displacements at the open end and none at the closed end.')
{: #Figure9}

The fundamental and overtones can be present simultaneously in a variety of
combinations. For example, middle C on a trumpet has a sound distinctively
different from middle C on a clarinet, both instruments being modified versions
of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually
the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different
and subject to shading by the musician. This mix is what gives various musical
instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they
have air columns, strings, sounding boxes, or drumheads. In fact, much of our
speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and
positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.
Simple resonant cavities can be made to resonate with the sound of the vowels,
for example. (See [[Figure 10]](#Figure10).) In boys, at puberty, the larynx grows
and the shape of the resonant cavity changes giving rise to the difference in
predominant frequencies in speech between men and women.

![Two pictures of the throat and mouth in cross-section are shown. The first picture has parts of the mouth and throat labeled. The first picture shows the position of the mouth and tongue when producing an a a a sound, and the second picture shows the position of the mouth and tongue when producing an e e e sound.](../resources/Figure_17_05_10.jpg 'The throat and mouth form an air column closed at one end that resonates in response to vibrations in the voice box. The spectrum of overtones and their intensities vary with mouth shaping and tongue position to form different sounds. The voice box can be replaced with a mechanical vibrator, and understandable speech is still possible. Variations in basic shapes make different voices recognizable.')
{: #Figure10}

Now let us look for a pattern in the resonant frequencies for a simple tube that
is closed at one end. The fundamental has $$\lambda =4L $$ , and frequency is
related to wavelength and the speed of sound as given by:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{w}=f\lambda . $$
</div>

Solving for $$f $$ in this equation gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$f=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{\lambda }=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}, $$
</div>

where $${v}_{w} $$ is the speed of sound in air. Similarly, the first overtone
has $$\lambda^{\prime} =4L/3 $$
(see [[Figure 9]](#Figure9)), so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$f^{\prime}=3\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}=3f. $$
</div>

Because $$f^{\prime}=3f $$ , we call the first overtone the third harmonic.
Continuing this process, we see a pattern that can be generalized in a single
expression. The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}\text{,} n=1,3,5\text{,} $$
</div>

where $${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental, $${f}_{3} $$ is the first overtone, and
so on. It is interesting that the resonant frequencies depend on the speed of
sound and, hence, on temperature. This dependence poses a noticeable problem for
organs in old unheated cathedrals, and it is also the reason why musicians
commonly bring their wind instruments to room temperature before playing them.

Find the Length of a Tube with a 128 Hz Fundamental
</div>
(a) What length should a tube closed at one end have on a day when the air temperature, is  $$22.0ºC $$ ,
 if its fundamental frequency is to be 128 Hz (C below middle C)?

(b) What is the frequency of its fourth overtone?

<strong> Strategy</strong>

The length $$L $$ can be found from the relationship in $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_
{w}}{4L} $$ , but we will first need to find the speed of sound $${v}_{w} $$.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Identify knowns:

- the fundamental frequency is 128 Hz
- the air temperature is $$22.0ºC $$
  (2) Use $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L} $$ to find the fundamental frequency (
  $$n=1 $$ ).

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{1}=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L} $$
</div>
(3) Solve this equation for length.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {4f}_{1}} $$
</div>
(4) Find the speed of sound using  $${v}_{w}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}} $$ .

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{w}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{295 \text{K}}{273 \text{K}}}=344 \text{m/s} $$
</div>
(5) Enter the values of the speed of sound and frequency into the expression for  $$L $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {4f}_{1}}=\frac{344 \text{m/s}}{4\left(128 \text{Hz}\right)}=0.672 \text{m} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (a)**

Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and
other devices for changing the length of the resonating air column and hence,
the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies, such as
tubas, require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops.

**Solution for (b)**

(1) Identify knowns:

- the first overtone has $$n=3 $$
- the second overtone has $$n=5 $$
- the third overtone has $$n=7 $$
- the fourth overtone has $$n=9 $$
  (2) Enter the value for the fourth overtone into $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_
  {w}}{4L} $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{9}=9\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}={9f}_{1}=1.15 \text{kHz} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (b)**

Whether this overtone occurs in a simple tube or a musical instrument depends on
how it is stimulated to vibrate and the details of its shape. The trombone, for
example, does not produce its fundamental frequency and only makes overtones.

</div>

Another type of tube is one that is _open_ at both ends. Examples are some organ
pipes, flutes, and oboes. The resonances of tubes open at both ends can be
analyzed in a very similar fashion to those for tubes closed at one end. The air
columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air displacements at both ends,
as illustrated in [[Figure 11]](#Figure11). Standing waves form as shown.

![The resonant frequency waves in a tube open at both ends are shown. There are a set of four images. The first image shows a tube of length L marked fundamental having half a wave. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The second image shows a tube of length L marked first over tone having a full wave. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The third image shows a tube of length L marked second over tone having a full wave and a half. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The fourth image shows a tube of length L marked third over tone having two full waves. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube.](../resources/Figure_17_05_11.jpg 'The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one end.')
{: #Figure11}

Based on the fact that a tube open at both ends has maximum air displacements at
both ends, and using [[Figure 11]](#Figure11) as a guide, we can see that the
resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{2L}, n=1, 2, 3\text{...,} $$
</div>

where $${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental, $${f}_{2} $$ is the first overtone,
$${f}\_{3} $$ is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at both
ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end.
It also has a different spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end. So
if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at
both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when
played because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example, would sound
richer played on an open tube, because it has even multiples of the fundamental
as well as odd. A closed tube has only odd multiples.

Real-World Applications: Resonance in Everyday Systems
</div>
Resonance occurs in many different systems, including strings, air columns, and atoms. Resonance is the driven or forced oscillation of a system at its natural frequency. At resonance, energy is transferred rapidly to the oscillating system, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows until the system can no longer be described by Hooke’s law. An example of this is the distorted sound intentionally produced in certain types of rock music.

</div>

Wind instruments use resonance in air columns to amplify tones made by lips or
vibrating reeds. Other instruments also use air resonance in clever ways to
amplify sound. [[Figure 12]](#Figure12) shows a violin and a guitar, both of
which have sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different
overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a sound that resonates in the
sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the
instrument its characteristic flavor. The more complex the shape of the sounding
box, the greater its ability to resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The
marimba, like the one shown in [[Figure 13]](#Figure13) uses pots or gourds
below the wooden slats to amplify their tones. The resonance of the pot can be
adjusted by adding water.

![First photograph is of a person playing the guitar and the second photograph is of a violin.](../resources/Figure_17_05_12.jpg 'String instruments such as violins and guitars use resonance in their sounding boxes to amplify and enrich the sound created by their vibrating strings.

{: #Figure13}

We have emphasized sound applications in our discussions of resonance and
standing waves, but these ideas apply to any system that has wave
characteristics. Vibrating strings, for example, are actually resonating and
have fundamentals and overtones similar to those for air columns. More subtle
are the resonances in atoms due to the wave character of their electrons. Their
orbitals can be viewed as standing waves, which have a fundamental (ground
state) and overtones (excited states). It is fascinating that wave
characteristics apply to such a wide range of physical systems.

### Section Summary

- Sound interference and resonance have the same properties as defined for all
  waves.
- In air columns, the lowest-frequency resonance is called the fundamental,
  whereas all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. Collectively,
  they are called harmonics.
- The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are:

  <div class="equation" >
   $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}\text{, }n=1, 3, 5\text{...}, $$
  </div>

$${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental and $$L $$ is the length of the tube.

A "showy" custom-built car has two brass horns that are supposed to produce the same frequency but actually emit 263.8 and 264.5 Hz. What beat frequency is produced?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When two sound waves of slightly different frequencies are played simultaneously, they interfere to produce a phenomenon called beats. The beat frequency is the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies. This occurs because the waves alternate between constructive interference (when they are in phase) and destructive interference (when they are out of phase), creating a pulsing or "beating" sound that we can hear.

**Solution**

The beat frequency is given by:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 - f_2|$$
</div>

Substituting the given frequencies:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |263.8\text{ Hz} - 264.5\text{ Hz}|$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |-0.7\text{ Hz}| = 0.7\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The beat frequency of 0.7 Hz means that the sound intensity will rise and fall 0.7 times per second, or roughly once every 1.4 seconds. This is easily perceptible to the human ear and would create an unpleasant warbling effect. This is precisely the effect that piano tuners use to tune pianos—they listen for beats between a tuning fork and a piano string, adjusting the string tension until the beats disappear (indicating the frequencies match exactly). In this case, the car's horns are out of tune with each other by a small but audible amount. The beat frequency is quite slow (less than 1 Hz), which makes the pulsing effect very obvious and annoying to listeners.

The final answer is: **The beat frequency produced is 0.7 Hz.**

What beat frequencies will be present: (a) If the musical notes A and C are played together (frequencies of 220 and 264 Hz)? (b) If D and F are played together (frequencies of 297 and 352 Hz)? (c) If all four are played together?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Beat frequencies occur when two or more sound waves of different frequencies interfere. For any pair of frequencies, the beat frequency is the absolute value of their difference. When more than two frequencies are present, we must consider all possible pairs to find all the beat frequencies that will be produced.

**Solution**

**(a) Notes A and C (220 Hz and 264 Hz)**

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |f_C - f_A| = |264\text{ Hz} - 220\text{ Hz}| = 44\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**(b) Notes D and F (297 Hz and 352 Hz)**

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |f_F - f_D| = |352\text{ Hz} - 297\text{ Hz}| = 55\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**(c) All four notes played together**

When all four notes (A, C, D, F) are played simultaneously, we must find the beat frequency for each possible pair. There are $$\binom{4}{2} = 6$$ possible pairs:

1. A and C: $$|264 - 220| = 44\text{ Hz}$$
2. A and D: $$|297 - 220| = 77\text{ Hz}$$
3. A and F: $$|352 - 220| = 132\text{ Hz}$$
4. C and D: $$|297 - 264| = 33\text{ Hz}$$
5. C and F: $$|352 - 264| = 88\text{ Hz}$$
6. D and F: $$|352 - 297| = 55\text{ Hz}$$

The beat frequencies present are: **33 Hz, 44 Hz, 55 Hz, 77 Hz, 88 Hz, and 132 Hz**.

**Discussion**

For parts (a) and (b), the beat frequencies are 44 Hz and 55 Hz, respectively. These beat frequencies are well within the audible range and would be perceived as distinct low-frequency tones rather than a pulsing or warbling effect. When beat frequencies are above about 15-20 Hz, the human ear begins to perceive them as separate tones (a phenomenon called a "difference tone") rather than amplitude modulation.

In part (c), when all four notes are played together, the sound becomes quite complex with six different beat frequencies. The lowest beat frequency (33 Hz) and the highest (132 Hz) span a wide range. In musical terms, playing these four notes together (A, C, D, F) would create a dissonant chord because several of the beat frequencies fall in the range where they create noticeable roughness. This is why certain musical intervals are considered consonant (pleasant) while others are dissonant (harsh)—the beat frequencies produced play a key role in our perception of harmony.

The final answers are: **(a) 44 Hz; (b) 55 Hz; (c) 33 Hz, 44 Hz, 55 Hz, 77 Hz, 88 Hz, and 132 Hz.**

What beat frequencies result if a piano hammer hits three strings that emit frequencies of 127.8, 128.1, and 128.3 Hz?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

A single piano key often has multiple strings (usually 2 or 3) that are struck simultaneously to produce a richer sound. When these strings are slightly out of tune with each other, they produce beats. With three strings, we have three possible pairs, and each pair will produce its own beat frequency. We calculate the beat frequency for each pair as the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies.

**Solution**

The three strings have frequencies $$f_1 = 127.8\text{ Hz}$$, $$f_2 = 128.1\text{ Hz}$$, and $$f_3 = 128.3\text{ Hz}$$.

There are three possible pairs:

 $$f_{\text{beat,13}} = |f_3 - f_1| = |128.3\text{ Hz} - 127.8\text{ Hz}| = 0.5\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The three beat frequencies produced are 0.3 Hz, 0.2 Hz, and 0.5 Hz. These are all quite slow beats (less than one beat per second), which would create a slow pulsing or wavering in the sound intensity. This is actually intentional in piano design! Piano tuners sometimes deliberately tune the multiple strings for a single note slightly differently to create a slow beating effect that gives the piano a warmer, richer tone called "stretch tuning" or to account for slight variations in string properties.

Notice that the beat frequency between strings 1 and 3 (0.5 Hz) equals the sum of the other two beat frequencies (0.3 Hz + 0.2 Hz = 0.5 Hz). This is not a coincidence—it's because the three frequencies are in order, so the largest separation equals the sum of the two smaller separations.

For reference, this note is close to C below middle C (C3), which has a frequency of 128 Hz on an evenly tempered scale. The slight variations indicate the strings are well-tuned but not perfectly matched.

The final answer is: **The beat frequencies are 0.3 Hz, 0.2 Hz, and 0.5 Hz.**

A piano tuner hears a beat every 2.00 s when listening to a 264.0-Hz tuning fork and a single piano string. What are the two possible frequencies of the string?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When a tuner hears one beat every 2.00 seconds, this means the beat frequency is $$f_{\text{beat}} = 1/(2.00\text{ s}) = 0.50\text{ Hz}$$. The beat frequency equals the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies. Since we know the tuning fork frequency and the beat frequency, the string frequency could be either higher or lower than the fork frequency by the beat frequency amount.

**Solution**

First, convert the beat period to beat frequency:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = \frac{1}{T_{\text{beat}}} = \frac{1}{2.00\text{ s}} = 0.50\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

The beat frequency is related to the two frequencies by:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{beat}} = |f_{\text{string}} - f_{\text{fork}}|$$
</div>

Substituting known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$0.50\text{ Hz} = |f_{\text{string}} - 264.0\text{ Hz}|$$
</div>

This absolute value equation has two solutions:

**Case 1:** The string frequency is higher than the fork:
<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{string}} = 264.0\text{ Hz} + 0.50\text{ Hz} = 264.5\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Case 2:** The string frequency is lower than the fork:
<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{string}} = 264.0\text{ Hz} - 0.50\text{ Hz} = 263.5\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The two possible frequencies are 264.5 Hz and 263.5 Hz. Without additional information, we cannot determine which one is correct just by listening to the beats. The tuner would need to either:

1. Slightly increase the string tension and observe whether the beat frequency increases or decreases. If the beats slow down (decrease in frequency), the string was initially at 264.5 Hz and is now getting closer to 264.0 Hz. If the beats speed up, the string was at 263.5 Hz and is moving further from the target.

2. Use a different reference frequency to determine whether the string is sharp (too high) or flat (too low).

This ambiguity is a fundamental limitation of the beat frequency method—it tells us how far out of tune we are, but not in which direction. The tuning fork frequency of 264.0 Hz corresponds to middle C (C4) on the evenly tempered scale, which is slightly different from the theoretical value used in some contexts (261.6 Hz for C4 at A4 = 440 Hz).

The final answer is: **The two possible frequencies of the string are 263.5 Hz and 264.5 Hz.**

(a) What is the fundamental frequency of a 0.672-m-long tube, open at both ends, on a day when the speed of sound is 344 m/s? (b) What is the frequency of its second harmonic?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

A tube open at both ends has antinodes (maximum air displacement) at both open ends. The fundamental frequency (first harmonic, $$n=1$$) corresponds to the longest wavelength that fits this boundary condition, which is when the tube length equals one-half wavelength. For a tube open at both ends, the resonant frequencies are given by $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{2L}$$, where $$n = 1, 2, 3,...$$ The second harmonic corresponds to $$n=2$$.

**Solution**

**(a) Fundamental frequency ($$n=1$$):**

For a tube open at both ends:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{2L}$$
</div>

For the fundamental frequency, $$n=1$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L} = \frac{344\text{ m/s}}{2(0.672\text{ m})} = \frac{344\text{ m/s}}{1.344\text{ m}} = 256\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**(b) Second harmonic ($$n=2$$):**

<div class="equation">
 $$f_2 = 2\frac{v_w}{2L} = 2f_1 = 2(256\text{ Hz}) = 512\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Alternatively, calculating directly:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_2 = \frac{2v_w}{2L} = \frac{2(344\text{ m/s})}{2(0.672\text{ m})} = \frac{688\text{ m/s}}{1.344\text{ m}} = 512\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The fundamental frequency of 256 Hz is middle C on the musical scale, which makes sense for an instrument like a flute or organ pipe of this length. Notice that for a tube open at both ends, the second harmonic is exactly twice the fundamental frequency. This is characteristic of open tubes—they produce all integer multiples of the fundamental (1f, 2f, 3f, 4f, ...), giving them a richer harmonic structure than tubes closed at one end.

We can verify our answer by checking the wavelength. For the fundamental, $$\lambda_1 = v_w/f_1 = 344\text{ m/s} / 256\text{ Hz} = 1.344\text{ m} = 2L$$, which confirms that the tube length equals one-half wavelength for the fundamental mode, as expected.

It's interesting to compare this with a tube closed at one end of the same length. Such a tube would have a fundamental frequency of $$f = v_w/(4L) = 344/(4 \times 0.672) = 128$$ Hz, exactly half the frequency of the open tube. This is why instruments can produce different notes by opening or closing tone holes.

The final answers are: **(a) The fundamental frequency is 256 Hz. (b) The second harmonic frequency is 512 Hz.**

If a wind instrument, such as a tuba, has a fundamental frequency of 32.0 Hz, what are its first three overtones? It is closed at one end. (The overtones of a real tuba are more complex than this example, because it is a tapered tube.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a tube closed at one end, the resonant frequencies follow the pattern $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{4L}$$ where $$n = 1, 3, 5, 7,...$$ (only odd integers). The fundamental frequency corresponds to $$n=1$$. The first overtone is $$n=3$$ (the third harmonic), the second overtone is $$n=5$$ (the fifth harmonic), and the third overtone is $$n=7$$ (the seventh harmonic). An important distinction: overtones are numbered by how many overtones above the fundamental they are, while harmonics are numbered by the value of $$n$$.

**Solution**

Given: $$f_1 = 32.0\text{ Hz}$$ (the fundamental frequency)

For a tube closed at one end, only odd harmonics are present, and each harmonic frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = nf_1 \text{ where } n = 1, 3, 5, 7,...$$
</div>

**First overtone (third harmonic, $$n=3$$):**
<div class="equation">
 $$f_3 = 3f_1 = 3(32.0\text{ Hz}) = 96.0\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Second overtone (fifth harmonic, $$n=5$$):**
<div class="equation">
 $$f_5 = 5f_1 = 5(32.0\text{ Hz}) = 160\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Third overtone (seventh harmonic, $$n=7$$):**
<div class="equation">
 $$f_7 = 7f_1 = 7(32.0\text{ Hz}) = 224\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first three overtones are 96.0 Hz, 160 Hz, and 224 Hz. Notice a crucial characteristic of tubes closed at one end: they only produce odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.). This is because a node must exist at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, which only allows odd multiples of the quarter-wavelength to fit in the tube.

This is fundamentally different from a tube open at both ends, which would produce all harmonics (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.). This difference in harmonic structure is what gives instruments their characteristic "color" or timbre. Clarinets, which approximate tubes closed at one end (the reed acts as a closed end), have a distinctive hollow sound because they lack even harmonics.

The fundamental frequency of 32.0 Hz is very low—it's approximately the note C1, nearly at the bottom of human hearing (which extends down to about 20 Hz). This is appropriate for a tuba, which is one of the lowest-pitched instruments in the orchestra. Real tubas are more complex because they are tapered (conical rather than cylindrical), which modifies the harmonic structure and allows some even harmonics to be present, giving the instrument a richer tone.

The final answer is: **The first three overtones are 96.0 Hz (third harmonic), 160 Hz (fifth harmonic), and 224 Hz (seventh harmonic).**

What are the first three overtones of a bassoon that has a fundamental frequency of 90.0 Hz? It is open at both ends. (The overtones of a real bassoon are more complex than this example, because its double reed makes it act more like a tube closed at one end.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a tube open at both ends, the resonant frequencies are $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{2L}$$ where $$n = 1, 2, 3, 4,...$$ (all positive integers). The fundamental is the first harmonic ($$n=1$$), the first overtone is the second harmonic ($$n=2$$), the second overtone is the third harmonic ($$n=3$$), and the third overtone is the fourth harmonic ($$n=4$$). Since all harmonics are present, each overtone frequency is simply an integer multiple of the fundamental.

**Solution**

Given: $$f_1 = 90.0\text{ Hz}$$ (the fundamental frequency)

For a tube open at both ends, all harmonics are present:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = nf_1 \text{ where } n = 1, 2, 3, 4,...$$

<div class="equation">
 $$f_3 = 3f_1 = 3(90.0\text{ Hz}) = 270\text{ Hz}$$

**Third overtone (fourth harmonic, $$n=4$$):**
<div class="equation">
 $$f_4 = 4f_1 = 4(90.0\text{ Hz}) = 360\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first three overtones are 180 Hz, 270 Hz, and 360 Hz. Notice that for a tube open at both ends, all integer harmonics are present (not just odd ones). This produces a much richer harmonic spectrum compared to a tube closed at one end. The overtones form a complete harmonic series: $$f_1, 2f_1, 3f_1, 4f_1,...$$

This is an important difference in terminology:
- **Harmonics** are numbered by their relationship to the fundamental: 1st harmonic (fundamental), 2nd harmonic, 3rd harmonic, etc.
- **Overtones** are numbered by how many resonances are above the fundamental: 1st overtone = 2nd harmonic, 2nd overtone = 3rd harmonic, etc.
- For open tubes: the nth overtone = the (n+1)th harmonic
- For closed tubes: the nth overtone = the (2n+1)th harmonic (because only odd harmonics exist)

The problem notes that real bassoons act more like tubes closed at one end due to their double reed. If this were the case, the overtones would be 270 Hz, 450 Hz, and 630 Hz (the 3rd, 5th, and 7th harmonics), giving a quite different sound. The presence or absence of even harmonics significantly affects the instrument's timbre—this is why clarinets (closed tube behavior) sound hollow compared to flutes (open tube behavior).

The fundamental frequency of 90.0 Hz is quite low, corresponding roughly to the note F♯2 or G♭2, appropriate for the bassoon's role as a bass instrument in the woodwind family.

The final answer is: **The first three overtones are 180 Hz (second harmonic), 270 Hz (third harmonic), and 360 Hz (fourth harmonic).**

How long must a flute be in order to have a fundamental frequency of 262 Hz (this frequency corresponds to middle C on the evenly tempered chromatic scale) on a day when air temperature is  $$20.0ºC $$ ?
 It is open at both ends.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

A flute is modeled as a tube open at both ends. For such a tube, the fundamental frequency is given by $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L}$$, where $$v_w$$ is the speed of sound in air and $$L$$ is the length of the tube. We need to first calculate the speed of sound at the given temperature, then solve for the length $$L$$. The speed of sound in air depends on temperature according to $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T}{273\text{ K}}}$$, where $$T$$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

**Solution**

First, convert the temperature to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 20.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 293.15\text{ K} \approx 293\text{ K}$$
</div>

Calculate the speed of sound at this temperature:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{293\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.0733} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0360) = 343\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Now solve for the length using the fundamental frequency formula for a tube open at both ends:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L}$$
</div>

Rearranging for $$L$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{v_w}{2f_1} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{2(262\text{ Hz})} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{524\text{ Hz}} = 0.655\text{ m} = 65.5\text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The flute must be 0.655 m or 65.5 cm long. This is a reasonable length for a concert flute, which typically ranges from about 60-67 cm depending on the specific design and whether all tone holes are closed. The frequency of 262 Hz corresponds to middle C (C4) on the evenly tempered chromatic scale.

We can verify this result by checking the wavelength. The wavelength of middle C at this temperature is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{v_w}{f} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{262\text{ Hz}} = 1.31\text{ m}$$
</div>

For a tube open at both ends in its fundamental mode, $$L = \lambda/2 = 1.31\text{ m}/2 = 0.655\text{ m}$$, which confirms our answer.

In practice, flutes produce different notes by opening and closing tone holes, which effectively changes the length of the resonating air column. When a player opens a tone hole, the air column effectively ends at that hole, shortening the tube and raising the pitch. The calculation here assumes all tone holes are closed, giving the lowest note the instrument can produce.

The final answer is: **The flute must be 0.655 m (or 65.5 cm) long.**

What length should an oboe have to produce a fundamental frequency of 110 Hz on a day when the speed of sound is 343 m/s? It is open at both ends.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

An oboe, modeled as a tube open at both ends, has a fundamental frequency given by $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L}$$. We are given the fundamental frequency and the speed of sound, so we can solve directly for the length $$L$$ by rearranging this equation.

**Solution**

For a tube open at both ends, the fundamental frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L}$$
</div>

Solving for the length $$L$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{v_w}{2f_1}$$
</div>

Substituting the given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{2(110\text{ Hz})} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{220\text{ Hz}} = 1.56\text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The oboe must be 1.56 m (or 156 cm) long to produce a fundamental frequency of 110 Hz. This is notably longer than a typical oboe! A standard oboe is actually about 65 cm long, which would produce a fundamental frequency around 264 Hz—much higher than the 110 Hz specified in this problem.

The frequency of 110 Hz corresponds to the musical note A2, which is quite low—two octaves below the standard tuning note A4 (440 Hz). This would be in the range of a bass instrument, not the soprano range where the oboe typically plays.

This discrepancy highlights an important point: the simplified model of a tube open at both ends doesn't perfectly represent real instruments. Real oboes:
1. Have a double reed that acts more like a closed end, making them behave somewhat like a tube closed at one end
2. Have a conical bore (tapered tube) rather than a cylindrical bore, which affects the harmonic structure
3. Produce their characteristic sound through a complex interaction of the reed vibration and air column resonance

If we modeled the oboe as a tube closed at one end (which is actually more accurate), the required length would be $$L = v_w/(4f_1) = 343/(4 \times 110) = 0.780$$ m or 78 cm—still longer than a real oboe but more reasonable.

Nonetheless, for the idealized open tube model given in the problem, the final answer is: **The oboe should be 1.56 m long.**

What is the length of a tube that has a fundamental frequency of 176 Hz and a first overtone of 352 Hz if the speed of sound is 343 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

First, we need to determine what type of tube this is by examining the relationship between the fundamental and first overtone frequencies. For a tube open at both ends, the first overtone is twice the fundamental ($$f_2 = 2f_1$$). For a tube closed at one end, the first overtone is three times the fundamental ($$f_3 = 3f_1$$). Once we identify the tube type, we can use the appropriate formula to find the length.

**Solution**

Check the ratio of first overtone to fundamental:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{f_{\text{first overtone}}}{f_1} = \frac{352\text{ Hz}}{176\text{ Hz}} = 2$$
</div>

Since the first overtone is exactly twice the fundamental frequency, this must be a **tube open at both ends**. For such a tube, the first overtone is the second harmonic.

For a tube open at both ends, the fundamental frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{2L}$$
</div>

Solving for the length $$L$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{v_w}{2f_1}$$
</div>

Substituting the given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{2(176\text{ Hz})} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{352\text{ Hz}} = 0.974\text{ m} \approx 0.97\text{ m}$$
</div>

**Verification:**

Let's verify this is correct by checking the first overtone frequency:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_2 = \frac{2v_w}{2L} = \frac{v_w}{L} = \frac{343\text{ m/s}}{0.974\text{ m}} = 352\text{ Hz}$$ ✓
</div>

**Discussion**

The tube is 0.97 m (or 97 cm) long and is open at both ends. The key to solving this problem was recognizing that the 2:1 ratio between the first overtone and fundamental indicates an open tube. If the tube had been closed at one end, the first overtone would have been $$3 \times 176 = 528$$ Hz (the third harmonic), not 352 Hz.

This type of reasoning—using the harmonic relationships to determine the tube configuration—is important in acoustic analysis. The harmonic series tells us a lot about the physical structure creating the sound:
- If overtones are all integer multiples (2f, 3f, 4f, ...), the tube is open at both ends
- If overtones are only odd multiples (3f, 5f, 7f, ...), the tube is closed at one end

The fundamental frequency of 176 Hz is approximately the note F3, and a tube of this length could represent an organ pipe or similar instrument. The length of 0.97 m is reasonable for producing sound in this frequency range.

The final answer is: **The tube is 0.97 m long and is open at both ends.**

(a) Find the length of an organ pipe closed at one end that produces a fundamental frequency of 256 Hz when air temperature is  $$18.0ºC $$ .
 (b) What is its fundamental frequency at  $$25.0ºC $$ ?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the formula for a tube closed at one end: $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L}$$. We first need to calculate the speed of sound at 18.0°C, then solve for the length. For part (b), we calculate the speed of sound at the new temperature and find the new fundamental frequency. Since the pipe length remains constant, we can also use the ratio of speeds to find the new frequency more directly.

**Solution**

**(a) Finding the length at 18.0°C:**

First, convert temperature to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
 $$T_1 = 18.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 291.15\text{ K} \approx 291\text{ K}$$
</div>

Calculate the speed of sound at 18.0°C:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,1} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T_1}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{291\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,1} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.0659} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0324) = 342\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

For a tube closed at one end:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_{w,1}}{4L}$$
</div>

Solving for $$L$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{v_{w,1}}{4f_1} = \frac{342\text{ m/s}}{4(256\text{ Hz})} = \frac{342\text{ m/s}}{1024\text{ Hz}} = 0.334\text{ m} = 33.4\text{ cm}$$
</div>

**(b) Finding the frequency at 25.0°C:**

Convert the new temperature to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
 $$T_2 = 25.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 298.15\text{ K} \approx 298\text{ K}$$
</div>

Calculate the speed of sound at 25.0°C:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,2} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{298\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.0916}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,2} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0448) = 346\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

The new fundamental frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_2 = \frac{v_{w,2}}{4L} = \frac{346\text{ m/s}}{4(0.334\text{ m})} = \frac{346\text{ m/s}}{1.336\text{ m}} = 259\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The organ pipe must be 0.334 m (33.4 cm) long. When the temperature increases from 18.0°C to 25.0°C, the fundamental frequency increases from 256 Hz to 259 Hz—a change of 3 Hz.

This temperature dependence of frequency is a significant concern for pipe organs in churches and concert halls. The frequency of 256 Hz corresponds to middle C, and a 3 Hz change represents about a 1.2% increase in frequency. This is noticeable to trained musicians, as it amounts to roughly 20 cents (where 100 cents equals one semitone), which is definitely audible.

The physical reason for this change is that the speed of sound increases with temperature because warmer air molecules move faster. Since the pipe length is fixed, higher sound speed means shorter wavelength and thus higher frequency: $$f = v_w/(4L)$$.

We can verify the reasonableness of the frequency change using the ratio:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \frac{v_{w,2}}{v_{w,1}} = \frac{346}{342} = 1.012$$
</div>

So $$f_2 = 1.012 \times 256\text{ Hz} = 259\text{ Hz}$$ ✓

This is why organs in old, unheated cathedrals can go significantly out of tune when temperatures fluctuate. Musicians warming up their wind instruments before playing are also addressing this temperature dependence—they want the instrument at a stable, known temperature for consistent tuning.

The final answers are: **(a) The organ pipe must be 0.334 m long. (b) The fundamental frequency at 25.0°C is 259 Hz.**

By what fraction will the frequencies produced by a wind instrument change when air temperature goes from  $$10.0ºC $$
 to  $$30.0ºC $$ ?
 That is, find the ratio of the frequencies at those temperatures.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For any wind instrument (whether open or closed), the resonant frequencies are proportional to the speed of sound: $$f \propto v_w$$. Since the instrument's physical length doesn't change with temperature, the ratio of frequencies at two different temperatures equals the ratio of sound speeds at those temperatures. We can use $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{T/273\text{ K}}$$ to find this ratio.

**Solution**

Convert both temperatures to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
 $$T_1 = 10.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 283.15\text{ K} \approx 283\text{ K}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$T_2 = 30.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 303.15\text{ K} \approx 303\text{ K}$$
</div>

Calculate the speed of sound at each temperature:

At $$T_1 = 283\text{ K}$$:
<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,1} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{283\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.0366} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0181) = 337\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

At $$T_2 = 303\text{ K}$$:
<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,2} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{303\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.1099} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0536) = 349\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

The ratio of frequencies is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \frac{v_{w,2}}{v_{w,1}} = \frac{349\text{ m/s}}{337\text{ m/s}} = 1.036$$
</div>

Alternatively, we can calculate this ratio directly from temperatures:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \frac{v_{w,2}}{v_{w,1}} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{303\text{ K}}{283\text{ K}}} = \sqrt{1.0707} = 1.035$$
</div>

The fractional change is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{\Delta f}{f_1} = \frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_1} = \frac{f_2}{f_1} - 1 = 1.036 - 1 = 0.036 = 3.6\%$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The frequencies increase by a factor of approximately 1.036, or about 3.6%, when the temperature increases from 10.0°C to 30.0°C. This is a significant change musically—it corresponds to about 60 cents (where 100 cents equals one semitone), which is quite noticeable.

This result is independent of whether the instrument is open or closed at the ends, and independent of which harmonic is being played. All frequencies shift by the same proportion because they all depend on $$v_w/L$$, and only $$v_w$$ changes with temperature.

The key physical insight is that the ratio of frequencies depends only on the ratio of absolute temperatures:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}$$
</div>

This square root relationship comes from the fact that sound speed is proportional to $$\sqrt{T}$$ (because the average molecular speed in a gas is proportional to $$\sqrt{T}$$, and sound waves are propagated by molecular collisions).

This is why orchestras and bands "warm up" their instruments before performing—bringing the instrument to room temperature ensures consistent tuning. A cold instrument brought in from outside could be noticeably out of tune. Similarly, vigorous playing can warm an instrument through the player's breath, causing it to drift sharp during a performance.

The final answer is: **The ratio of frequencies is $$f_2/f_1 = 1.036$$, representing a 3.6% increase in frequency.**

The ear canal resonates like a tube closed at one end. (See [[Figure 5]](../contents/ch17Hearing#Figure5).) If ear canals range in length from 1.80 to 2.60 cm in an average population, what is the range of fundamental resonant frequencies? Take air temperature to be  $$37.0ºC $$ ,
 which is the same as body temperature. How does this result correlate with the intensity versus frequency graph ([[Figure 3]](../contents/ch17Hearing#Figure3) of the human ear?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The ear canal acts as a tube closed at one end (closed by the eardrum), so its fundamental frequency is $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L}$$. We need to calculate the speed of sound at body temperature (37.0°C), then find the fundamental frequencies for both the shortest (1.80 cm) and longest (2.60 cm) ear canals. The shortest canal will have the highest frequency, and the longest will have the lowest.

**Solution**

First, convert the temperature to Kelvin and find the speed of sound:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 37.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 310.15\text{ K} \approx 310\text{ K}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{310\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.1355} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0656) = 353\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Convert the ear canal lengths to meters:
- Shortest: $$L_{\text{short}} = 1.80\text{ cm} = 0.0180\text{ m}$$
- Longest: $$L_{\text{long}} = 2.60\text{ cm} = 0.0260\text{ m}$$

For the **shortest ear canal** (highest frequency):

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_w}{4L_{\text{short}}} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{4(0.0180\text{ m})} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{0.0720\text{ m}} = 4903\text{ Hz} \approx 4.90\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

For the **longest ear canal** (lowest frequency):

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{min}} = \frac{v_w}{4L_{\text{long}}} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{4(0.0260\text{ m})} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{0.1040\text{ m}} = 3394\text{ Hz} \approx 3.39\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The range of fundamental resonant frequencies for human ear canals is approximately **3.39 kHz to 4.90 kHz**. This is a crucial result for understanding human hearing!

The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies in the range of 2-5 kHz, with peak sensitivity around 3-4 kHz. The ear canal resonance falls right in this range, which is not a coincidence. The resonance of the ear canal acts as a natural amplifier, boosting sounds in this frequency range before they reach the eardrum. This makes evolutionary sense because:

1. Many important sounds for human communication and survival fall in this range
2. Human speech has significant energy content in the 2-4 kHz range, particularly for consonants that are crucial for understanding speech
3. Warning sounds (like a baby's cry or alarm calls) often have frequencies in this range

The ear canal essentially acts as an acoustic resonator that enhances our sensitivity to frequencies that are most important for survival and communication. Without this resonance, we would be less sensitive to these crucial frequencies.

The variation in ear canal length (1.80 to 2.60 cm) accounts for differences between individuals—children have shorter ear canals and thus higher resonant frequencies, while adults have longer canals with lower resonant frequencies. This is one reason why sound perception can vary slightly between individuals.

The final answer is: **The range of fundamental resonant frequencies is 3.39 kHz to 4.90 kHz, which correlates well with the peak sensitivity range of human hearing.**

Calculate the first overtone in an ear canal, which resonates like a 2.40-cm-long tube closed at one end, by taking air temperature to be  $$37.0ºC $$ .
 Is the ear particularly sensitive to such a frequency? (The resonances of the ear canal are complicated by its nonuniform shape, which we shall ignore.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For a tube closed at one end, the first overtone is the third harmonic ($$n=3$$). The resonant frequencies follow $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{4L}$$ where $$n = 1, 3, 5,...$$ We first need to calculate the speed of sound at body temperature (37.0°C), then use $$n=3$$ to find the first overtone frequency.

**Solution**

Convert temperature to Kelvin and calculate the speed of sound:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 37.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 310.15\text{ K} \approx 310\text{ K}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{310\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.1355} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0656) = 353\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Convert the ear canal length to meters:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = 2.40\text{ cm} = 0.0240\text{ m}$$
</div>

For a tube closed at one end, the first overtone corresponds to $$n=3$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_3 = 3\frac{v_w}{4L} = \frac{3(353\text{ m/s})}{4(0.0240\text{ m})} = \frac{1059\text{ m/s}}{0.0960\text{ m}} = 11,031\text{ Hz} \approx 11.0\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

Alternatively, we could first find the fundamental and multiply by 3:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{4(0.0240\text{ m})} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{0.0960\text{ m}} = 3677\text{ Hz} \approx 3.68\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$f_3 = 3f_1 = 3(3.68\text{ kHz}) = 11.0\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first overtone of this ear canal is approximately 11.0 kHz. This frequency is well within the audible range (20 Hz to 20 kHz for young adults), but is at the upper end of the frequency range where the human ear is most sensitive.

Human hearing sensitivity drops off significantly above about 8-10 kHz, so while we can hear 11 kHz, the ear is not particularly sensitive to this frequency. The ear is most sensitive to frequencies in the 2-5 kHz range (which includes the fundamental frequency of 3.68 kHz for this ear canal), with sensitivity decreasing for both lower and higher frequencies.

The fundamental resonance (3.68 kHz) falls right in the peak sensitivity range of human hearing, which is why it has a significant effect on our hearing. The first overtone at 11.0 kHz, while audible, contributes much less to the ear's frequency response because:

1. The ear's sensitivity is much lower at 11 kHz than at 3.68 kHz
2. The amplitude of the first overtone is generally weaker than the fundamental
3. Many adults lose sensitivity to frequencies above 10 kHz with age

This is why the fundamental resonance of the ear canal (around 3-4 kHz) is the dominant factor in the ear's frequency response, while higher overtones play a much smaller role. The ear canal primarily amplifies sounds around 3-4 kHz due to its fundamental resonance.

The final answer is: **The first overtone is 11.0 kHz. The ear is not particularly sensitive to this frequency, as human hearing sensitivity has already declined significantly by 11 kHz compared to the peak sensitivity around 3-4 kHz.**

A crude approximation of voice production is to consider the breathing passages and mouth to be a resonating tube closed at one end. (See [[Figure 10]](#Figure10).) (a) What is the fundamental frequency if the tube is 0.240-m long, by taking air temperature to be  $$37.0ºC $$ ?
 (b) What would this frequency become if the person replaced the air with helium? Assume the same temperature dependence for helium as for air.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The vocal tract can be approximated as a tube closed at one end (closed at the vocal cords, open at the mouth), with fundamental frequency $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L}$$. For part (a), we calculate the speed of sound in air at body temperature. For part (b), we need to account for helium's different properties. The speed of sound in helium at a given temperature is approximately 2.96 times faster than in air due to helium's lower molecular mass.

**Solution**

**(a) Fundamental frequency with air:**

Convert temperature to Kelvin:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 37.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 310.15\text{ K} \approx 310\text{ K}$$
</div>

Calculate speed of sound in air at 37.0°C:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,\text{air}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{310\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0656) = 353\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Calculate the fundamental frequency:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{1,\text{air}} = \frac{v_{w,\text{air}}}{4L} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{4(0.240\text{ m})} = \frac{353\text{ m/s}}{0.960\text{ m}} = 368\text{ Hz} \approx 367\text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**(b) Fundamental frequency with helium:**

The speed of sound in helium at the same temperature is approximately:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{w,\text{helium}} = 2.96 \times v_{w,\text{air}} = 2.96 \times 353\text{ m/s} = 1045\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

The fundamental frequency with helium:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{1,\text{helium}} = \frac{v_{w,\text{helium}}}{4L} = \frac{1045\text{ m/s}}{4(0.240\text{ m})} = \frac{1045\text{ m/s}}{0.960\text{ m}} = 1089\text{ Hz} \approx 1.09\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

Alternatively, we can use the ratio:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{1,\text{helium}} = 2.96 \times f_{1,\text{air}} = 2.96 \times 367\text{ Hz} = 1086\text{ Hz} \approx 1.07\text{ kHz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

With air, the fundamental frequency is 367 Hz, which is reasonably close to typical human speech frequencies. The fundamental frequency of the human voice typically ranges from about 85 Hz (bass male voice) to 255 Hz (soprano female voice), so 367 Hz is somewhat high but in a plausible range for certain vowel formants or a high-pitched voice.

With helium, the fundamental frequency increases to approximately 1.07 kHz—nearly three times higher than with air. This is the famous "Donald Duck" or "chipmunk" effect! When people inhale helium and speak, their voices sound much higher-pitched because:

1. Sound travels much faster in helium (about 3 times faster) due to helium's lower molecular mass (4 g/mol for He vs. 29 g/mol for air)
2. The vocal tract length doesn't change, so $$f = v/(4L)$$ increases proportionally with sound speed
3. All resonant frequencies shift upward by the same factor

It's important to note that the vocal cords themselves vibrate at the same frequency regardless of the gas—what changes is the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The vocal tract acts as a filter, and its resonances (called formants in speech science) shift dramatically with helium, giving the characteristic high-pitched sound.

This simplified model treats the vocal tract as a uniform tube, but real vocal tracts have varying cross-sections that create multiple resonances. Nevertheless, the basic physics of why helium raises pitch is correctly captured: higher sound speed leads to higher resonant frequencies for a fixed geometry.

The final answers are: **(a) The fundamental frequency with air is 367 Hz. (b) The fundamental frequency with helium is 1.07 kHz.**

(a) Students in a physics lab are asked to find the length of an air column in a tube closed at one end that has a fundamental frequency of 256 Hz. They hold the tube vertically and fill it with water to the top, then lower the water while a 256-Hz tuning fork is rung and listen for the first resonance. What is the air temperature if the resonance occurs for a length of 0.336 m? (b) At what length will they observe the second resonance (first overtone)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a classic resonance tube experiment. The water surface acts as the closed end, and the top of the tube is open. For part (a), the first resonance occurs at the fundamental frequency where $$L = \lambda/4$$. We can use $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L}$$ to find the speed of sound, then determine the temperature from $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{T/273\text{ K}}$$. For part (b), the second resonance (first overtone) occurs at the third harmonic where $$L = 3\lambda/4$$.

**Solution**

**(a) Finding the air temperature:**

For a tube closed at one end, the fundamental frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{v_w}{4L}$$
</div>

Solve for the speed of sound:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = 4Lf_1 = 4(0.336\text{ m})(256\text{ Hz}) = 344\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Now use the temperature dependence of sound speed to find the temperature:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{T}{273\text{ K}}}$$
</div>

Solving for $$T$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{v_w}{331\text{ m/s}} = \sqrt{\frac{T}{273\text{ K}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\left(\frac{v_w}{331\text{ m/s}}\right)^2 = \frac{T}{273\text{ K}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 273\text{ K} \times \left(\frac{344\text{ m/s}}{331\text{ m/s}}\right)^2 = 273\text{ K} \times (1.0393)^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 273\text{ K} \times 1.0802 = 295\text{ K}$$
</div>

Convert to Celsius:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 295\text{ K} - 273 = 22°\text{C}$$
</div>

**(b) Finding the length for the first overtone:**

For a tube closed at one end, the first overtone is the third harmonic ($$n=3$$). The relationship between successive resonances is:

<div class="equation">
 $$L_3 = 3L_1$$
</div>

More precisely, for the first overtone:

<div class="equation">
 $$L_3 = \frac{3\lambda}{4} = 3 \times \frac{\lambda}{4} = 3L_1 = 3(0.336\text{ m}) = 1.008\text{ m} \approx 1.01\text{ m}$$
</div>

We can verify this using the formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_3 = \frac{3v_w}{4L_3}$$
</div>

Since $$f_3 = f_1 = 256\text{ Hz}$$ (same tuning fork):

<div class="equation">
 $$L_3 = \frac{3v_w}{4f_1} = \frac{3(344\text{ m/s})}{4(256\text{ Hz})} = \frac{1032\text{ m/s}}{1024\text{ Hz}} = 1.01\text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The air temperature is 22°C, which is a comfortable room temperature and typical for a physics laboratory. This temperature determination works because the speed of sound is strongly temperature-dependent, and we can back-calculate the temperature from measured resonance data.

The second resonance occurs at a length of 1.01 m, which is exactly three times the first resonance length (0.336 m × 3 = 1.008 m). This demonstrates a key feature of tubes closed at one end: the resonances occur at lengths that are odd multiples of the fundamental length (L, 3L, 5L, 7L, ...).

This experiment is commonly used in introductory physics labs because:
1. It's a direct, hands-on way to measure the speed of sound
2. It clearly demonstrates standing wave resonance
3. Students can actually hear the resonance—there's a distinct increase in loudness when the water level is at a resonant position
4. It illustrates the difference between closed and open tubes

In practice, students would need to account for an "end correction"—the antinode doesn't form exactly at the tube's open end but slightly beyond it (typically about 0.3 times the tube diameter). This makes actual measured lengths slightly shorter than the theoretical values, but for introductory purposes, this correction is often neglected.

The final answers are: **(a) The air temperature is 22°C. (b) The second resonance (first overtone) occurs at a length of 1.01 m.**

What frequencies will a 1.80-m-long tube produce in the audible range at  $$20.0ºC $$
 if: (a) The tube is closed at one end? (b) It is open at both ends?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The audible range for humans is approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). For a tube closed at one end, resonant frequencies are $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{4L}$$ where $$n = 1, 3, 5,...$$ (odd integers only). For a tube open at both ends, $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{2L}$$ where $$n = 1, 2, 3,...$$ (all positive integers). We first calculate the speed of sound at 20.0°C, then determine which harmonics fall within the audible range.

**Solution**

Convert temperature to Kelvin and calculate the speed of sound:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 20.0°\text{C} + 273.15 = 293.15\text{ K} \approx 293\text{ K}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{\frac{293\text{ K}}{273\text{ K}}} = (331\text{ m/s})\sqrt{1.0733} = (331\text{ m/s})(1.0360) = 343\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**(a) Tube closed at one end:**

The resonant frequencies are:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{4L} = n\frac{343\text{ m/s}}{4(1.80\text{ m})} = n\frac{343\text{ m/s}}{7.20\text{ m}} = n(47.6\text{ Hz})$$
</div>

where $$n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,...$$ (odd integers only).

Find the maximum value of $$n$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$n_{\text{max}} = \frac{20,000\text{ Hz}}{47.6\text{ Hz}} = 420.2$$
</div>

Since $$n$$ must be odd, the largest odd value is $$n = 419$$.

Therefore, the frequencies are:
<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = n(47.6\text{ Hz}), \quad n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 419$$
</div>

The first few frequencies are:
- $$n=1$$: $$f_1 = 47.6\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=3$$: $$f_3 = 143\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=5$$: $$f_5 = 238\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=7$$: $$f_7 = 333\text{ Hz}$$
- ...
- $$n=419$$: $$f_{419} = 19,944\text{ Hz} \approx 19.9\text{ kHz}$$

**(b) Tube open at both ends:**

The resonant frequencies are:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = n\frac{v_w}{2L} = n\frac{343\text{ m/s}}{2(1.80\text{ m})} = n\frac{343\text{ m/s}}{3.60\text{ m}} = n(95.3\text{ Hz})$$
</div>

where $$n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...$$ (all positive integers).

Find the maximum value of $$n$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$n_{\text{max}} = \frac{20,000\text{ Hz}}{95.3\text{ Hz}} = 209.9 \approx 210$$
</div>

Therefore, the frequencies are:
<div class="equation">
 $$f_n = n(95.3\text{ Hz}), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 210$$
</div>

The first few frequencies are:
- $$n=1$$: $$f_1 = 95.3\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=2$$: $$f_2 = 191\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=3$$: $$f_3 = 286\text{ Hz}$$
- $$n=4$$: $$f_4 = 381\text{ Hz}$$
- ...
- $$n=210$$: $$f_{210} = 20,013\text{ Hz} \approx 20.0\text{ kHz}$$

**Discussion**

This problem beautifully illustrates the key differences between tubes closed at one end and tubes open at both ends:

**Closed tube (part a):**
- Fundamental frequency: 47.6 Hz (quite low)
- Only odd harmonics: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.
- Total of 210 audible frequencies (since only odd n values: 1, 3, 5, ..., 419)
- Harmonic spacing: 95.2 Hz (every other harmonic is missing)

**Open tube (part b):**
- Fundamental frequency: 95.3 Hz (exactly twice that of the closed tube)
- All harmonics: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.
- Total of 210 audible frequencies
- Harmonic spacing: 95.3 Hz (evenly spaced)

The closed tube has the same number of resonances as the open tube even though it only has odd harmonics because its fundamental is half the frequency, allowing it to fit twice as many odd harmonics in the audible range.

Both tubes produce rich harmonic spectra suitable for musical applications. The fundamental of 47.6 Hz for the closed tube is close to G1 (49 Hz), while the open tube's fundamental of 95.3 Hz is close to G2 (98 Hz). A 1.80-m tube is quite long—typical for bass organ pipes or similar low-frequency instruments.

The difference in timbre between these two configurations would be dramatic: the closed tube would have a "hollow" sound (lacking even harmonics), while the open tube would have a fuller, richer sound with both even and odd harmonics present.

The final answers are: **(a) $$f_n = n(47.6\text{ Hz})$$ where $$n = 1, 3, 5, ..., 419$$ (odd integers). (b) $$f_n = n(95.3\text{ Hz})$$ where $$n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 210$$ (all integers).**
