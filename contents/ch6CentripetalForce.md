</div>

Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial
acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball,
the force of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, friction between roller skates and a
rink floor, a banked roadway’s force on a car, and forces on the tube of a
spinning centrifuge.

Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a **centripetal force**.
The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature, the
same as the direction of centripetal acceleration. According to Newton’s second
law of motion, net force is mass times acceleration:
$$\vb{F}_\text{net} =m \vb{a}$$. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration
is the centripetal acceleration—$$\vb{a}=\vb{a}_\text{c}$$. Thus, the magnitude
of centripetal force$$\mag{F\_\text{c} }$$is

<div class="equation">
$$\mag{F_\text{c}} = m \mag{ \ac }.$$
</div>

By using the expressions for the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration $$\mag{ \ac }$$ from $$\ac=\frac{v^{2}}{r}; \ac =r \omega^{2}$$, we get two
expressions for the magnitude of the centripetal force $$\mag{F\_\text{c}}$$
in terms of mass, velocity, angular velocity, and radius of curvature:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_\text{c}=m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}; F_\text{c}=m r \omega^{2}.$$
</div>

You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient.
Centripetal force$$\vb{F}_{\text{c}}$$is always perpendicular to the path
and pointing to the center of curvature, because$$\vb{a}_{\text{c}}$$is
perpendicular to the velocity and pointing to the center of curvature.

Note that if you solve the first expression for$$r$$, you get

<div class="equation">
$$r=\frac{ mv^{2}}{ F_\text{c}}.$$
</div>

This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force
causes a small radius of curvature—that is, a tight curve.

![The given figure consists of two semicircles, one over the other. The top semicircle is bigger and the one below is smaller. In both the figures, the direction of the path is given along the semicircle in the counter-clockwise direction. A point is shown on the path, where the radius from the circle, r, is shown with an arrow from the center of the circle. At the same point, the centripetal force is shown in the opposite direction to that of radius arrow. The velocity, v, is shown along this point in the left upward direction and is perpendicular to the force. In both the figures, the velocity is same, but the radius is smaller and centripetal force is larger in the lower figure.](../resources/Figure_06_03_01.jpg 'The frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it.

What Coefficient of Friction Do Car Tires Need on a Flat Curve?
</div>
(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900 kg car that negotiates a 500 m radius curve at 25.0 m/s.

(b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction,
between the tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the
car from slipping (see [Figure 2](#Figure2)).

**Strategy and Solution for (a)**

We know that $$F\_{\text{c}}=\frac{ m v^{2} }{r}$$. Thus,

<div class="equation">
$$F_{\text{c}}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
=\frac{ \left( 900 \kg \right)
\left(25.0 \ms \right)^{2}}
{\left(500 \m \right)}=1125 \N$$
</div>

**Strategy for (b)**

[Figure 2](#Figure2) shows the forces acting on the car on an unbanked (level
ground) curve. Friction is to the left, keeping the car from slipping, and
because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the
centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at
which the tires roll but do not slip) is$$\mu_{\s}N$$, where$$\mu_{\s}$$
is the static coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The normal
force equals the car’s weight on level ground, so that$$N=mg$$. Thus the
centripetal force in this situation is

<div class="equation">
$$F_{\text{c}}=f=\mu_{\s} N=\mu_{\s} mg .$$
</div>
Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction.
Using the first expression for $$F_{\text{c}}$$
 from the equation
<div class="equation">
$$\begin{array}{lll}
{F}_{\text{c}}&=&m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\\
{F}_{\text{c}}&=& mr \omega^{2}
\end{array},$$</div> <div class="equation">$$m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}=\mu_{\s}mg .$$
</div>

We solve this for $$\mu\_{\s}$$, noting that mass cancels, and obtain

<div class="equation">
$$\mu_{\s}=\frac{ v^{2}}{rg}.$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Substituting the knowns,

<div class="equation">
$$\mu_{\s}=\frac{ \left(25.0 \ms \right)^{2}} {\left(500 \m \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)}=0.13.$$ 
</div>
(Because
coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two
digits.)

**Discussion**

We could also solve part (a) using the first expression in$$\left. \begin{array}{lll} F_{\text{c}}&=&m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\\ F_{\text{c}}&=&mr\omega^{2} \end{array} \right\} ,$$because$$m$$,$$v$$, and
$$r$$are given. The coefficient of friction found in part (b) is much smaller
than is typically found between tires and roads. The car will still negotiate
the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a
responsive force, being able to assume a value less than but no more than$$\mu_{\s} N$$. A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the
curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe
speed would be less than 25 m/s. Note that mass cancels, implying that in this
example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn.
Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which
in turn is proportional to mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the
normal force would be less as will be discussed below.

</div>

![In the given figure, a car is shown from the back, which is turning to the left. The weight, w, of the car is shown with a down arrow and N with an up arrow at the back of the car. At the right rear wheel, centripetal force is shown along with its equation formula in a leftward horizontal arrow. The free-body diagram shows three vectors, one upward, depicting N, one downward, depicting w, and one leftward, depicting centripetal force.](../resources/Figure_06_03_02.jpg 'This car on level ground is moving away and turning to the left. The centripetal force causing the car to turn in a circular path is due to friction between the tires and the road. A minimum coefficient of friction is needed, or the car will move in a larger-radius curve and leave the roadway.')
{: #Figure2}

Let us now consider **banked curves**, where the slope of the road helps you
negotiate the curve. See [Figure 3](#Figure3). The greater the angle$$\theta$$,
the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars, for
example, often have steeply banked curves. In an “ideally banked curve,” the
angle$$\theta$$is such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain speed
without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an
expression for$$\theta$$for an ideally banked curve and consider an example
related to it.

For **ideal banking**, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal
force in the absence of friction. The components of the normal force N in the
horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the
weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it
is most convenient to consider components along perpendicular axes—in this case,
the vertical and horizontal directions.

[Figure 3](#Figure3) shows a free body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked
curve. If the angle$$\theta$$is ideal for the speed and radius, then the net
external force will equal the necessary centripetal force. The only two external
forces acting on the car are its weight$$\vb{w}$$and the normal force of the
road$$\vb{N}$$. (A frictionless surface can only exert a force perpendicular
to the surface—that is, a normal force.) These two forces must add to give a net
external force that is horizontal toward the center of curvature and has
magnitude$$m \frac{v^{2}}{r}$$. Because this is the crucial force and it is
horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Only
the normal force has a horizontal component, and so this must equal the
centripetal force—that is,

<div class="equation">
 $$N\sin{\theta} =\frac{ mv^{2}}{r}.$$
</div>

Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force
must be zero, meaning that the vertical components of the two external forces
must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From the figure, we see
that the vertical component of the normal force is$$N\cos{\theta}$$, and the
only other vertical force is the car’s weight. These must be equal in magnitude;
thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$N\cos{\theta} =mg .$$
</div>

Now we can combine the last two equations to eliminate$$N$$and get an
expression for$$\theta$$, as desired. Solving the second equation for$$N=mg/\left( \cos{\theta} \right)$$, and substituting this into the first yields

<div class="equation">
 $$mg \frac{ \sin{\theta} }{\cos{\theta} }=\frac{ m v^{2}}{r}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\begin{array}{rrr}
mg \tan\left(\theta \right)&=& \frac{ mv^{2}}{r}\\
\tan{\theta} &=& \frac{ v^{2}}{rg} .
\end{array}$$
</div>

Taking the inverse tangent gives

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(\frac{ v^{2}}{rg}\right)\text{(ideally banked curve, no friction).}$$
</div>

This expression can be understood by considering how$$\theta$$depends on
$$v$$and$$r$$. A large$$\theta$$will be obtained for a large$$v$$and a
small$$r$$. That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp
curves. Friction helps, because it allows you to take the curve at greater or
lower speed than if the curve is frictionless. Note that$$\theta$$does not
depend on the mass of the vehicle.

![In this figure, a car from the backside is shown, turning to the left, on a slope angling downward to the left. A point in the middle of the back of the car is shown which shows one downward vector depicting weight, w, and an upward arrow depicting force N, which is a linear line along the car and is at an angle theta with the straight up arrow. The slope is at an angle theta with the horizontal surface below the slope. The force values, N multiply sine theta equals to centripetal force, the net force on the car and N cosine theta equal to w are given below the car. ](../resources/Figure_06_03_03.jpg 'The car on this banked curve is moving away and turning to the left.')

<div class="title">
What Is the Ideal Speed to Take a Steeply Banked Tight Curve?
</div>
Curves on some test tracks and race courses, such as the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100 m radius curve banked at 65.0° should be driven if the road is frictionless.

**Strategy**

We first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked
curve except for speed are known; thus, we need only rearrange it so that speed
appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.

**Solution**

Starting with

<div class="equation">
 $$\tan{\theta} =\frac{ v^{2}}{r g}$$
</div>
we get

<div class="equation">
 $$v=\sqrt{rg \tan{\theta}}.$$
</div>
Noting that$$\tan{65.0^\circ } = 2.14$$, we obtain

<div class="equation">
$$\begin{array}{lll}
v&=& \sqrt{\left(100 \m \right) \left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(2.14\right)}\\
v&=& 45.8 \ms .
\end{array}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is just about 165 km/h, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather
sharp curve. Tire friction enables a vehicle to take the curve at significantly
higher speeds.

Calculations similar to those in the preceding examples can be performed for a
host of interesting situations in which centripetal force is involved—a number
of these are presented in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

  rotation. It is perpendicular to linear velocity$$v$$and has magnitude

(c) Compare each force with her weight.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll convert angular velocities to rad/s, then use$$F_c = mr\omega^2$$to calculate the centripetal force. We'll compare each to the child's weight$$w = mg$$.

**Solution**

(a) Convert angular velocity and calculate centripetal force:

<div class="equation">
$$\omega = 40.0\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} \times \frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ s}} = 4.19\text{ rad/s}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$F_c = mr\omega^2 = (22.0\text{ kg})(1.25\text{ m})(4.19\text{ rad/s})^2 = (22.0)(1.25)(17.6) = 483\text{ N}$$
</div>

(b) For the amusement park ride:

<div class="equation">
$$\omega = 3.00\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} \times \frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ s}} = 0.314\text{ rad/s}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$F_c = mr\omega^2 = (22.0\text{ kg})(8.00\text{ m})(0.314\text{ rad/s})^2 = (22.0)(8.00)(0.0987) = 17.4\text{ N}$$
</div>

(c) Calculate the child's weight and compare:

<div class="equation">
$$w = mg = (22.0\text{ kg})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 216\text{ N}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{F_{c,a}}{w} = \frac{483\text{ N}}{216\text{ N}} = 2.24$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{F_{c,b}}{w} = \frac{17.4\text{ N}}{216\text{ N}} = 0.0807$$
</div>

**Discussion**

On the playground merry-go-round, the child must exert a centripetal force of 483 N, which is 2.24 times her weight - she would feel significantly "heavier" and need to hold on tightly. On the slower amusement park ride, she needs only 17.4 N, which is just 0.0807 times her weight - barely noticeable. The much larger radius partially compensates for the slower rotation rate in the second case.

**Strategy**

We need to find the centripetal force using$$F_c = mr\omega^2$$. First, we'll convert the angular velocity from rev/s to rad/s, then calculate the centripetal force.

**Solution**

Convert angular velocity to rad/s:

<div class="equation">
$$\omega = 0.5\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{1\text{ rev}} = \pi\text{ rad/s} = 3.14\text{ rad/s}$$

Calculate the centripetal force:

**Discussion**

The centripetal force on the end of the wind turbine blade is approximately 3950 N or about 3.95 kN. This substantial force must be withstood by the blade structure and mounting points, which is why wind turbine blades are constructed from strong, lightweight composite materials. Even though the mass at the tip is only 4 kg, the large radius and rotational speed create a significant centripetal force.

**Strategy**

For an ideally banked curve, we use$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v^2}{rg}\right)$$. We'll need to convert the speed from km/h to m/s.

**Discussion**

The ideal banking angle for this highway curve is 4.14°, which is a very gentle slope. At this angle, cars traveling at exactly 105 km/h would not need any friction between the tires and road to negotiate the turn - the normal force from the banked road would provide exactly the right amount of centripetal force. In practice, highway curves are typically banked at conservative angles to accommodate a range of speeds safely.

For an ideally banked curve (no friction needed), we use the relationship$$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$. We'll solve for$$v$$and substitute the known values.

Starting with the ideal banking equation:

<div class="equation">
$$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$

Solve for$$v$$:

<div class="equation">
$$v^2 = rg\tan\theta$$

Substitute known values ($$r = 100$$m,$$g = 9.80$$m/s²,$$\theta = 20.0°$$):

<div class="equation">
$$v = \sqrt{(100\text{ m})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2)\tan(20.0°)} = \sqrt{(980)(0.364)} = \sqrt{357} = 18.9\text{ m/s}$$

**Discussion**

The ideal speed to take the 100 m radius curve banked at 20.0° is 18.9 m/s (about 68 km/h or 42 mi/h). At this speed, no friction between the tires and road is needed to maintain the circular path - the normal force from the banked road provides exactly the right amount of centripetal force. At speeds higher or lower than this ideal speed, friction would be required to prevent the car from sliding up or down the banked surface.

(b) Calculate the centripetal acceleration.

(c) Does this acceleration seem large to you?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For an ideally banked curve (no friction required), we use the relationship$$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$. We'll solve for the radius$$r$$, then calculate the centripetal acceleration using$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$and compare it to$$g$$.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Banking angle:$$\theta = 75.0°$$
- Speed:$$v = 30.0 \ms$$

**(a) Radius of the turn:**

From the ideal banking formula:

<div class="equation">
$$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$
</div>

Solving for$$r$$:

<div class="equation">
$$r = \frac{v^2}{g\tan\theta}$$
</div>

Substitute values:

<div class="equation">
$$r = \frac{(30.0\text{ m/s})^2}{(9.80\text{ m/s}^2)\tan(75.0°)} = \frac{900}{(9.80)(3.732)} = \frac{900}{36.6} = 24.6\text{ m}$$
</div>

**(b) Centripetal acceleration:**

<div class="equation">
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(30.0\text{ m/s})^2}{24.6\text{ m}} = \frac{900}{24.6} = 36.6\text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

**(c) Comparison to g:**

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{a_c}{g} = \frac{36.6\text{ m/s}^2}{9.80\text{ m/s}^2} = 3.73$$
</div>

So$$a_c = 3.73g$$.

**Discussion**

The centripetal acceleration of 3.73g means that the bobsledders experience a force nearly 4 times their normal weight pushing them into the side of the bobsled. While this might not seem extreme compared to fighter pilots who experience up to 9g, bobsledders must maintain this level of force throughout the turn while also controlling their sled. The 75° banking angle is quite steep - nearly vertical - which is typical for bobsled tracks where tight, fast turns are needed. The small radius of just 24.6 m allows for exciting, high-speed turns while the steep banking keeps the forces manageable. Bobsledders train to handle these forces and must have strong core and neck muscles to maintain proper positioning throughout the run.

**Answer**

(a) The radius of the bobsled turn is **24.6 m**.

(b) The centripetal acceleration is **36.6 m/s²**.

(c) This acceleration is **3.73g**, which is significant but typical for bobsled runs. It requires athletic conditioning but is within human tolerance for short durations.

Part of riding a bicycle involves leaning at the correct angle when making a turn, as seen in [Figure 8](#Figure8). To be stable, the force exerted by the ground must be on a line going through the center of gravity. The force on the bicycle wheel can be resolved into two perpendicular components—friction parallel to the road (this must supply the centripetal force), and the vertical normal force (which must equal the system's weight).

(a) Show that$$\theta$$
(as defined in the figure) is related to the speed$$v$$and radius of
curvature$$r$$of the turn in the same way as for an ideally banked
roadway—that is,$$\theta ={\tan}^{-1}{v}^{2}/rg$$
(b) Calculate$$\theta$$for a 12.0 m/s turn of radius 30.0 m (as in a race).

One is from the bottom the front cycle wheel to the right depicting centripetal force, another one is from the same point drawn vertically upward showing the force N, making an angle theta with the slope of the front cycle wheel. The third vector is drawn from the chest of the boy to vertically downward to the bottom showing his weight, w. An arrow from the bottom of the wheel to the chest point of the boy is also shown depicting the slope of the bicycle with force F exerting on it. A free-body diagram is also given alongside the figure showing the direction of weight and force vectors. And the values of net F equals to sum of N and centripetal force, and N equals to weight W also given alongside on the right.](../resources/Figure_06_03_08.jpg 'A bicyclist negotiating a turn on level ground must lean at the correct angle—the ability to do this becomes instinctive. The force of the ground on the wheel needs to be on a line through the center of gravity. The net external force on the system is the centripetal force.

This process produces a relationship among the angle θ, the speed v, and the radius of curvature r of the turn similar to that for the ideal banking of roadways.')

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll analyze the forces on the bicycle and rider system. The net force from the ground has components: horizontal (friction providing centripetal force) and vertical (normal force balancing weight). The resultant must pass through the center of gravity, making angle$$\theta$$with the vertical.
(b) We'll use the derived formula to calculate the angle for the given speed and radius.

**Solution**

(a) The horizontal component of the ground force is the friction$$f$$, which provides the centripetal force:

<div class="equation">
$$f = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
</div>

The vertical component is the normal force$$N$$, which equals the weight:

<div class="equation">
$$N = mg$$
</div>

The angle$$\theta$$that the resultant force makes with the vertical is:

<div class="equation">
$$\tan\theta = \frac{f}{N} = \frac{mv^2/r}{mg} = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v^2}{rg}\right)$$
</div>

This is identical to the formula for an ideally banked curve.

(b) Calculate$$\theta$$for$$v = 12.0$$m/s and$$r = 30.0$$m:

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v^2}{rg}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{(12.0\text{ m/s})^2}{(30.0\text{ m})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2)}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{144}{294}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.490) = 26.1°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

We have shown that the bicycle lean angle follows the same relationship as an ideally banked curve. For the racing turn at 12.0 m/s with a 30.0 m radius, the cyclist must lean at 26.1° from the vertical. This significant lean angle is necessary to keep the line of action of the ground force passing through the center of gravity, ensuring stability. Experienced cyclists make these adjustments instinctively.

A large centrifuge, like the one shown in [Figure 9](#Figure9)(a), is used to expose aspiring astronauts to accelerations similar to those experienced in rocket launches and atmospheric reentries.

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use$$a_c = r\omega^2$$with$$a_c = 10g = 98.0$$m/s² and solve for$$\omega$$.
(b) We'll draw a free body diagram and use the fact that the cage hangs at an angle where the arm force can simultaneously provide the centripetal force and support the weight. Using geometry,$$\tan\theta = \frac{g}{a_c}$$.

**Solution**

(a) Using$$a_c = r\omega^2$$, solve for$$\omega$$:

<div class="equation">
$$a_c = 10g = 10(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 98.0\text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\omega^2 = \frac{a_c}{r} = \frac{98.0\text{ m/s}^2}{15.0\text{ m}} = 6.53\text{ rad}^2\text{/s}^2$$

<div class="equation">
$$\omega = \sqrt{6.53} = 2.56\text{ rad/s}$$

(b) Draw a free body diagram: The cage experiences its weight$$mg$$downward and the arm force$$F$$at angle$$\theta$$below horizontal. The horizontal component of$$F$$provides centripetal force, while the vertical component balances weight:

<div class="equation">
$$F\cos\theta = ma_c \quad \text{and} \quad F\sin\theta = mg$$
</div>

Dividing the second equation by the first:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{F\sin\theta}{F\cos\theta} = \frac{mg}{ma_c}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\tan\theta = \frac{g}{a_c} = \frac{9.80}{98.0} = 0.100$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta = \arctan(0.100) = 5.71^\circ$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The centrifuge must rotate at 2.56 rad/s (about 24.4 rpm) to produce 10g acceleration at a radius of 15.0 m. The cage hangs only 5.71° below horizontal because the centripetal acceleration (10g) is much larger than gravitational acceleration (1g). This small angle means the arm force is nearly horizontal, pointing mostly toward the center to provide the large centripetal force needed. As rotation increases, the angle becomes even smaller, approaching horizontal. This pivoting cage design ensures the rider always experiences force along the cage axis, preventing uncomfortable sideways forces.

**Integrated Concepts**

If a car takes a banked curve at less than the ideal speed, friction is needed
to keep it from sliding toward the inside of the curve (a real problem on icy
mountain roads).
(a) Calculate the ideal speed to take a 100 m radius curve banked at
$$15.0^\circ$$.
(b) What is the minimum coefficient of friction needed for a frightened driver
to take the same curve at 20.0 km/h?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) For the ideal speed (no friction needed), the horizontal component of the normal force provides exactly the needed centripetal force. We'll use$$v = \sqrt{rg\tan\theta}$$.
(b) At a speed lower than ideal, friction must prevent sliding inward. We'll analyze forces to find the minimum coefficient of friction.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate the ideal speed using the formula for a banked curve:

<div class="equation">
$$v = \sqrt{rg\tan\theta} = \sqrt{(100\text{ m})(9.80\text{ m/s}^2)\tan(15.0^\circ)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v = \sqrt{(980)(0.268)} = \sqrt{262.6} = 16.2\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

(b) Convert the actual speed to m/s:

<div class="equation">
$$v = 20.0\frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{1000\text{ m}}{1\text{ km}} \times \frac{1\text{ h}}{3600\text{ s}} = 5.56\text{ m/s}$$
</div>

At this slower speed, the car tends to slide down the bank. The required centripetal force is less than what the banked curve would naturally provide, so friction must act up the slope. Using force balance equations for a banked curve with friction:

<div class="equation">
$$\mu_s = \frac{\tan\theta - \frac{v^2}{rg}}{1 + \frac{v^2\tan\theta}{rg}}$$
</div>

Calculate$$\frac{v^2}{rg}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v^2}{rg} = \frac{(5.56)^2}{(100)(9.80)} = \frac{30.9}{980} = 0.0316$$
</div>

Now calculate$$\mu_s$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\mu_s = \frac{0.268 - 0.0316}{1 + (0.0316)(0.268)} = \frac{0.236}{1.0085} = 0.234$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ideal speed for this banked curve is 16.2 m/s (about 58 km/h), at which no friction is needed. However, at the much slower speed of 20.0 km/h (5.56 m/s), the car requires a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.234 to prevent sliding down toward the inside of the curve. This is why icy mountain roads with banked curves are particularly dangerous—if the coefficient of friction drops below this value due to ice, slow-moving vehicles will slide inward regardless of driver skill. The problem illustrates why banked curves are designed for a specific "ideal" speed, and driving significantly slower than this speed can be just as problematic as driving too fast.

Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in [Figure 10](#Figure10). The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. What is the speed of the roller coaster at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is 15.0 m and the downward acceleration of the car is 1.50 g?

![A teardrop shaped loop of a roller coaster is shown. The car of the roller coaster starts from the point A near the right of the base and covers the teardrop portion of the roller coaster and move to a point D at the left of base.

With a small radius of curvature at the top, the centripetal acceleration can more easily be kept greater than

g

so that the passengers do not lose contact with their seats nor do they need seat belts to keep them in place.')
{: #Figure10}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the speed at the top of the loop given the centripetal acceleration and radius of curvature. We'll use$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$and solve for$$v$$. The centripetal acceleration is given as 1.50g, where$$g = 9.80$$m/s².

**Solution**

The centripetal acceleration is:

<div class="equation">
$$a_c = 1.50g = 1.50(9.80\text{ m/s}^2) = 14.7\text{ m/s}^2$$

Using the centripetal acceleration formula and solving for$$v$$:

<div class="equation">
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v^2 = a_c r = (14.7\text{ m/s}^2)(15.0\text{ m}) = 221\text{ m}^2\text{/s}^2$$

<div class="equation">
$$v = \sqrt{221\text{ m}^2\text{/s}^2} = 14.9\text{ m/s}$$

**Discussion**

The speed of the roller coaster at the top of the loop is 14.9 m/s (about 54 km/h or 33 mi/h). At this speed with a 15.0 m radius of curvature, the centripetal acceleration is 1.50g, which means passengers experience a downward force 1.50 times their normal weight. This keeps them firmly pressed into their seats even though they are upside down at the top of the loop, creating the thrilling sensation that makes roller coasters exciting while maintaining safety.

an unbanked 50.0 m radius curve at 30.0 m/s.

(b) What is unreasonable about the result?

(c) Which premises are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For an unbanked curve, friction provides the centripetal force. We'll set up the equation where friction equals the required centripetal force, then solve for the coefficient of friction. We'll then analyze whether the result is physically reasonable.

**Solution**

**(a)** For circular motion on an unbanked curve:

The centripetal force is provided by friction:
<div class="equation">
$$f = \mu_s N = \mu_s mg$$
</div>

This must equal the required centripetal force:
<div class="equation">
$$\mu_s mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
</div>

Solving for the coefficient of friction (mass cancels):
<div class="equation">
$$\mu_s = \frac{v^2}{rg} = \frac{(30.0 \text{ m/s})^2}{(50.0 \text{ m})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)} = \frac{900}{490} = 1.84$$
</div>

**(b)** A coefficient of friction of 1.84 is unreasonable. Typical coefficients of static friction between rubber tires and dry pavement range from 0.7 to 1.0. Values significantly greater than 1.0 are not physically achievable with normal road surfaces and tires.

**(c)** The assumed speed of 30.0 m/s (108 km/h or 67 mph) is too great for a 50.0 m radius curve. At this tight radius, safer speeds would be around 15-20 m/s. Alternatively, banking the curve would reduce the required friction coefficient.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates why highway curves are designed with specific speed limits based on their radius. For a 50.0 m radius curve with μ = 0.7 (wet conditions), the maximum safe speed would be:
$$v = \sqrt{\mu rg} = \sqrt{(0.7)(50.0)(9.80)} = 18.5 \text{ m/s} \approx 67 \text{ km/h}$$

This is why tight curves on roads have reduced speed limits and are often banked.
