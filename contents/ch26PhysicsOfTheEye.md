Early thinkers had a wide array of theories regarding vision. Euclid and Ptolemy believed that the eyes emitted rays of light; others promoted the idea that objects gave off some particle or substance that was discerned by the eye. Ibn al-Haytham (sometimes called Alhazen), who was mentioned earlier as an originator of the scientific method, conducted a number of experiments to illustrate how the anatomical construction of the eye led to its ability to form images. He recognized that light reflected from objects entered the eye through the lens and was passed to the optic nerve. Al-Haytham did not fully understand the mechanisms involved, but many subsequent discoveries in vision, reflection, and magnification built on his discoveries and methods.

The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. The eye is
remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color it can
detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction, to reach what is called
“normal” vision, but should be called ideal rather than normal. Image formation
by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze with the optics
discussed in [Geometric Optics](../contents/ch25GeometricOptics).

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens
form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For
clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina,
which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its
power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The
center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light
receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. The variable
opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to
detect light intensities from the lowest observable to $$ 10^{10} $$ times
greater (without damage). This is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes
perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement,
sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins
with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve
conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.

![The figure depicts the internal structure of an eye with labels. These labels include cornea, iris, aqueous humor, ciliary fibers, lens, vitreous humor, retina, fovea, sclera disc, and optic nerve.](../resources/Figure_26_01_01.jpg 'The cornea and lens of an eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest concentration of receptors in the fovea and a blind spot over the optic nerve. The power of the lens of an eye is adjustable to provide an image on the retina for varying object distances. Layers of tissues with varying indices of refraction in the lens are shown here. However, they have been omitted from other pictures for clarity.')
{: #Figure1}

Refractive indices are crucial to image formation using
lenses. [[Table 1]](#Table1) shows refractive indices relevant to the eye.
The biggest change in the refractive index, and bending of rays, occurs at the
cornea rather than the lens. The ray diagram in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows
image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to
the refractive indices provided in [[Table 1]](#Table1). The cornea provides
about two-thirds of the power of the eye, owing to the fact that speed of light
changes considerably while traveling from air into cornea. The lens provides the
remaining power needed to produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens
can be treated as a single thin lens, even though the light rays pass through
several layers of material (such as cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the
lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image
formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This is a case 1
image. Images formed in the eye are inverted but the brain inverts them once
more to make them seem upright.

![Ray diagram in the picture shows the internal structure of an eye and a tree that is taken as an object. An inverted image of the tree is formed on retina with the light rays coming from the top and bottom of the tree; converging most at the cornea and upon entering and exiting the lens. The rays coming from top of the tree are labeled one, two, while the bottom rays are labeled three, four. The inverted image of the tree shows rays labeled three, four at the top and one, two at the bottom.](../resources/Figure_26_01_02.jpg 'An image is formed on the retina with light rays converging most at the cornea and upon entering and exiting the lens. Rays from the top and bottom of the object are traced and produce an inverted real image on the retina. The distance to the object is drawn smaller than scale.')
{: #Figure2}

As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision —
that is, the image distance $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ must equal the lens-to-retina
distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, the image
distance $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ must be the same for objects at all distances. The
eye manages this by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to
accommodate for objects at various distances. The process of adjusting the eye’s
focal length is called **accommodation**. A person with normal (ideal) vision
can see objects clearly at distances ranging from 25 cm to essentially infinity.
However, although the near point (the shortest distance at which a sharp focus
can be obtained) increases with age (becoming meters for some older people), we
will consider it to be 25 cm in our treatment here.

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows the accommodation of the eye for distant and near
vision. Since light rays from a nearby object can diverge and still enter the
eye, the lens must be more converging (more powerful) for close vision than for
distant vision. To be more converging, the lens is made thicker by the action of
the ciliary muscle surrounding it. The eye is most relaxed when viewing distant
objects, one reason that microscopes and telescopes are designed to produce
distant images. Vision of very distant objects is called _totally relaxed_,
while close vision is termed _accommodated_, with the closest vision being _
fully accommodated_.

![Two cross-sectional views of eye anatomy are shown. In part a of the figure, parallel rays from distant object are entering the eye and are converging on the retina to produce an inverted image of the tree shown above the principle axis. The interior lens of the eye is relaxed and least rounded, given as P small. Distance of image d i is equal to two centimeters, which is the measure of the distance from lens to retina. Distance of object d o is given as very large. In part b of the figure, rays from a button, which is a nearby object, are shown to diverge as they enter the eye. The interior lens of the eye, P large, converges the rays to form an image at retina, below the principle axis. Distance of image d i is equal to two centimeters, which is the measure of distance from lens to retina. Distance of object d o is given as very small.](../resources/Figure_26_01_03.jpg 'Relaxed and accommodated vision for distant and close objects. (a) Light rays from the same point on a distant object must be nearly parallel while entering the eye and more easily converge to produce an image on the retina. (b) Light rays from a nearby object can diverge more and still enter the eye. A more powerful lens is needed to converge them on the retina than if they were parallel.')
{: #Figure3}

We will use the thin lens equations to examine image formation by the eye
quantitatively. First, note the power of a lens is given as $$P=1/f $$ , so we
rewrite the thin lens equations as

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}} $$
</div>

and

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=m . $$
</div>

We understand that $${d}_{\text{i}} $$ must equal the lens-to-retina distance to
obtain clear vision, and that normal vision is possible for objects at distances
$${d}\_{o}=25 \text{cm} $$ to infinity.

Take-Home Experiment: The Pupil
</div>
Look at the central transparent area of someone’s eye, the pupil, in normal room light. Estimate the diameter of the pupil. Now turn off the lights and darken the room. After a few minutes turn on the lights and promptly estimate the diameter of the pupil. What happens to the pupil as the eye adjusts to the room light? Explain your observations.

</div>

The eye can detect an impressive amount of detail, considering how small the
image is on the retina. To get some idea of how small the image can be, consider
the following example.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Size of Image on Retina
</div>
What is the size of the image on the retina of a  $$ 1.20 \times 10^{-2}  $$
 cm diameter human hair, held at arm’s length (60.0 cm) away? Take the lens-to-retina distance to be 2.00 cm.

**Strategy**

We want to find the height of the image $${h}_{i} $$ , given the height of the
object is $${h}_{o}= 1.20 \times 10^{-2} $$ cm. We also know that the object is
60.0 cm away, so that $${d}_{o}=60.0 \text{cm} $$ . For clear vision, the image
distance must equal the lens-to-retina distance, and so $${d}_{\text{i}}=2.00
\text{cm} $$ . The equation $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{
{d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=m $$ can be used to find $${h}_{i} $$ with the
known information.

**Solution**

The only unknown variable in the equation $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_
{\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=m $$ is $${h}_{\text{i}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}. $$
</div>
Rearranging to isolate  $${h}_{\text{i}} $$  yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${h}_{\text{i}}=-{h}_{\text{o}}\cdot \frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}. $$
</div>
Substituting the known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{h}_{\text{i}}& =& -\left( 1.20 \times 10^{-2}  \text{cm}\right)\frac{2.00 \text{cm}}{60.0 \text{cm}}\\ & =&  -4.00 \times 10^{-4}  \text{cm}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This truly small image is not the smallest discernible—that is, the limit to
visual acuity is even smaller than this. Limitations on visual acuity have to do
with the wave properties of light and will be discussed in the next chapter.
Some limitation is also due to the inherent anatomy of the eye and processing
that occurs in our brain.

<div class="title">
Power Range of the Eye
</div>
Calculate the power of the eye when viewing objects at the greatest and smallest distances possible with normal vision, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of 2.00 cm (a typical value).

**Strategy**

For clear vision, the image must be on the retina, and so $${d}_{\text{i}}=2.00
\text{cm} $$ here. For distant vision, $${d}_{o}\approx \infty $$ , and for
close vision, $${d}_{o}=25.0 \text{cm} $$ , as discussed earlier. The equation
$$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}} $$ as written just
above, can be used directly to solve for $$P $$ in both cases, since we know
$${d}_{\text{i}} $$ and $${d}_{o} $$ . Power has units of diopters, where $$1
\text{D}=1 \text{/m} $$ , and so we should express all distances in meters.

**Solution**

For distant vision,

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{\infty }+\frac{1}{0.0200 \text{m}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Since  $$1/\infty =0 $$ ,  this gives
<div class="equation" >
 $$P=0+ 50.0/\text{m}=50.0 \text{D (distant vision).} $$
</div>
Now, for close vision,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}P& =& \frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{0.250 \text{m}}+\frac{1}{0.0200 \text{m}}\\ 
P & =& \frac{4.00}{\text{m}}+\frac{50.0}{\text{m}}=4.00 \text{D}+50.0 \text{D}\\ 
P & =& 54.0 \text{D (close vision).}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

For an eye with this typical 2.00 cm lens-to-retina distance, the power of the
eye ranges from 50.0 D (for distant totally relaxed vision) to 54.0 D (for close
fully accommodated vision), which is an 8% increase. This increase in power for
close vision is consistent with the preceding discussion and the ray tracing
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). An 8% ability to accommodate is considered normal but
is typical for people who are about 40 years old. Younger people have greater
accommodation ability, whereas older people gradually lose the ability to
accommodate. When an optometrist identifies accommodation as a problem in elder
people, it is most likely due to stiffening of the lens. The lens of the eye
changes with age in ways that tend to preserve the ability to see distant
objects clearly but do not allow the eye to accommodate for close vision, a
condition called **presbyopia** (literally, elder eye). To correct this vision
defect, we place a converging, positive power lens in front of the eye, such as
found in reading glasses. Commonly available reading glasses are rated by their
power in diopters, typically ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 D.

</div>

### Section Summary

- Image formation by the eye is adequately described by the thin lens equations:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$P=\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}+\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}} \text{and} \frac{ {h}_{\text{i}}}{ {h}_{\text{o}}}=-\frac{ {d}_{\text{i}}}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=m. $$
  </div>

- The eye produces a real image on the retina by adjusting its focal length and
  power in a process called accommodation.
- For close vision, the eye is fully accommodated and has its greatest power,
  whereas for distant vision, it is totally relaxed and has its smallest power.
- The loss of the ability to accommodate with age is called presbyopia, which is
  corrected by the use of a converging lens to add power for close vision.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the power of the eye when viewing an object 50.0 cm away?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the power of the eye when viewing an object at 50.0 cm, we use the thin lens equation in power form: $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$. The object distance is given as $$d_o = 50.0$$ cm, and the image distance (lens-to-retina distance) is $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm. We must convert both distances to meters since power is measured in diopters (D), where $$1 \text{ D} = 1 \text{ m}^{-1}$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Object distance: $$d_o = 50.0 \text{ cm} = 0.500 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{0.500 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 2.00 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 52.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The power of the eye when viewing an object 50.0 cm away is 52.0 D. This represents a 2.0 D increase over the relaxed eye power of 50.0 D (for distant vision at infinity). This 2.0 D of accommodation is well within the normal range—a typical young adult can accommodate up to 4.0 D. The calculation shows that reading at arm's length (approximately 50 cm) requires moderate accommodation. This distance is comfortable for extended reading, which is why many people naturally hold books and devices at about this distance. As people age and lose accommodation ability (presbyopia), this 50 cm distance may become the closest they can see clearly without reading glasses.

Calculate the power of the eye when viewing an object 3.00 m away.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The power of the eye can be calculated using the thin lens equation $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$, where $$d_o$$ is the object distance and $$d_i$$ is the image distance (lens-to-retina distance). For clear vision, the image must form on the retina, so $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm. We need to convert all distances to meters since power is measured in diopters ($$1 \text{ D} = 1 \text{ m}^{-1}$$).

**Solution**

Given values:
- Object distance: $$d_o = 3.00 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the power equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{3.00 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 0.333 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 50.3 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The power of the eye when viewing an object 3.00 m away is 50.3 D, which is only slightly greater than the 50.0 D required for distant vision (at infinity). This makes sense because 3.00 m is relatively far from the eye, so the eye is nearly completely relaxed. The small additional 0.3 D of power represents minimal accommodation compared to the 4.0 D increase needed for close vision at 25 cm. This demonstrates that objects beyond a few meters require essentially the same eye power as viewing objects at infinity, which is why distant objects from 3 m to infinity are all in clear focus for a relaxed eye.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the magnification formula $$\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$ to find the image height $$h_i$$ on the retina, where $$h_o = 3.50$$ mm is the object height, $$d_o = 30.0$$ cm is the object distance, and $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm is the lens-to-retina distance. For part (b), we compare the calculated image size to the typical dimensions of photoreceptors in the fovea (rods: ~2 μm diameter, cones: ~1.5-3 μm diameter in the fovea).

**Solution**

Given values:
- Object height: $$h_o = 3.50 \text{ mm} = 3.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$$
- Object distance: $$d_o = 30.0 \text{ cm} = 0.300 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

**(a)** Using the magnification equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$
</div>

Solving for the image height:

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -h_o \times \frac{d_i}{d_o} = -(3.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times \frac{0.0200 \text{ m}}{0.300 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -(3.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times 0.0667 = -2.33 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -0.233 \text{ mm} = -233 \text{ μm}$$
</div>

The negative sign indicates an inverted image, which is expected for the eye.

**(b)** Comparison with photoreceptors:
- Image height: 233 μm
- Cone diameter in fovea: ~1.5-3 μm
- Rod diameter: ~2 μm

The image height (233 μm) is approximately **78-155 times larger** than the diameter of individual cones in the fovea. This means the image of a 3.50 mm letter spans about 78-155 cones, allowing excellent resolution of fine details within letters.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The retinal image of 3.50 mm print is 0.233 mm (233 μm) tall. Despite being a ~15-fold reduction in size, this is still quite large relative to the photoreceptors on the retina.

Part (b): Since each 3.50 mm letter produces an image spanning approximately 78-155 photoreceptors, the eye can easily distinguish individual letters and even fine details within letters such as serifs, the crossbar in an "A", or the dot on an "i". Each feature of a letter might span 10-20 or more cones, providing excellent resolution.

The fovea contains approximately 200,000 cones packed into a ~1.5 mm diameter area, giving exceptional acuity for central vision. The fact that the image of a single letter spans dozens of cones explains why we can read small print clearly. The eye-brain system performs even better than this simple calculation suggests due to lateral inhibition, edge detection, pattern recognition, and higher-order visual processing in the visual cortex. This is why we can sometimes read print even smaller than 3.50 mm under good lighting conditions.

Suppose a certain person's visual acuity is such that he can see objects clearly that form an image  $$4.00 \mu m $$
 high on his retina. What is the maximum distance at which he can read the 75.0 cm high letters on the side of an airplane?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem involves finding the object distance $$d_o$$ at which a letter of height $$h_o = 75.0$$ cm produces an image of height $$h_i = 4.00 \mu\text{m}$$ on the retina. We use the magnification equation $$\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$, where $$d_i = 2.00$$ cm is the lens-to-retina distance. Solving for $$d_o$$ will give us the maximum distance at which the person can read the letters.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Object height: $$h_o = 75.0 \text{ cm} = 0.750 \text{ m}$$
- Image height: $$h_i = 4.00 \mu\text{m} = 4.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

Using the magnification equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$d_o$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = -\frac{h_o \cdot d_i}{h_i}$$
</div>

Substituting the known values:

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = -\frac{(0.750 \text{ m})(0.0200 \text{ m})}{4.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = -\frac{0.0150 \text{ m}^2}{4.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = -3750 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Taking the magnitude (the negative sign indicates an inverted image, which is expected):

<div class="equation">
 $$d_o = 3750 \text{ m} = 3.75 \text{ km}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This person can read the 75.0 cm high letters from a maximum distance of 3.75 km (about 2.3 miles). This is a remarkably long distance and demonstrates the impressive resolution of the human visual system. The visual acuity of 4.00 μm corresponds to the ability to distinguish fine details approaching the size of individual photoreceptors on the retina. For reference, the diameter of a cone cell in the fovea is approximately 2-3 μm, so a 4.00 μm image is only slightly larger than a single cone.

This calculation assumes ideal viewing conditions (clear air, good contrast, proper lighting). In practice, atmospheric effects, contrast limitations, and other factors would likely reduce the actual reading distance. Nevertheless, this problem illustrates why large letters are used on aircraft and why they remain legible from considerable distances. The linear relationship between object size and viewing distance means that doubling the letter size would double the maximum readable distance.

For parts (b) and (c), we use the magnification equation $$\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$ to calculate the retinal image size for a 1.00 mm object at different viewing distances.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Near point: $$d_o = 8.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0800 \text{ m}$$
- Lens-to-retina distance: $$d_i = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$
- Object size: $$h_o = 1.00 \text{ mm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$$
- Normal near point: $$d_{o,\text{normal}} = 25.0 \text{ cm} = 0.250 \text{ m}$$

**(a)** Calculate the accommodated power:

<div class="equation">
 $$P = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{0.0800 \text{ m}} + \frac{1}{0.0200 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P = 12.5 \text{ D} + 50.0 \text{ D} = 62.5 \text{ D}$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate the image size at 8.00 cm:

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -h_o \times \frac{d_i}{d_o} = -(1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times \frac{0.0200 \text{ m}}{0.0800 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -(1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times 0.250 = -2.50 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} = -0.250 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**(c)** Calculate the image size at 25.0 cm:

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -h_o \times \frac{d_i}{d_{o,\text{normal}}} = -(1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times \frac{0.0200 \text{ m}}{0.250 \text{ m}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$h_i = -(1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times 0.0800 = -8.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m} = -0.0800 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The jeweller's accommodated power of 62.5 D represents a remarkable 12.5 D of accommodation (compared to 50.0 D for distant vision). This is more than three times the typical 4.0 D accommodation of a young adult. Such exceptional near vision is developed through years of close-up work and may also involve some degree of natural myopia that, while problematic for distant vision, is advantageous for detailed close work.

Part (b): At 8.00 cm, the 1.00 mm object produces a retinal image of 0.250 mm (250 μm). This is larger than typical print images and allows the jeweller to see extremely fine details like hallmarks, engravings, or imperfections in gemstones.

Part (c): At the normal 25.0 cm distance, the same object would produce only a 0.0800 mm (80 μm) image—less than one-third the size. The ratio of image sizes (250 μm / 80 μm = 3.125) equals the ratio of distances (25.0 cm / 8.00 cm = 3.125), as expected from the linear magnification relationship.

This problem illustrates why jewellers and others doing fine detail work benefit from exceptional near vision. The ability to work at 8.00 cm instead of 25.0 cm provides more than 3× magnification "for free" without requiring magnifying glasses. However, this extreme accommodation cannot be maintained for long periods without eye strain, which is why professional jewellers often supplement their natural vision with magnifying loupes or microscopes for extended detailed work.
