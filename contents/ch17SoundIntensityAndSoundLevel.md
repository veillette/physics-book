In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground.
After settling into bed, you may hear your blood pulsing through your ears. But
when a passing motorist has his stereo turned up, you cannot even hear what the
person next to you in your car is saying. We are all very familiar with the
loudness of sounds and aware that they are related to how energetically the
source is vibrating. In cartoons depicting a screaming person (or an animal
making a loud noise), the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating
uvula, the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth, to suggest a loud sound
coming from the throat [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). High noise exposure is hazardous
to hearing, and it is common for musicians to have hearing losses that are
sufficiently severe that they interfere with the musicians’ abilities to
perform. The relevant physical quantity is sound intensity, a concept that is
valid for all sounds whether or not they are in the audible range.

Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. Power is
the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, **intensity** $$I $$ is

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{P}{A}, $$
</div>

where $$P $$ is the power through an area $$A $$ . The SI unit for $$I $$ is
$${W/m}^{2} $$ . The intensity of a sound wave is related to its amplitude
squared by the following relationship:

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{ {\left(\Delta p\right)}^{2}}{2\rho v_{w}}. $$
</div>

Here $$\Delta p $$ is the pressure variation or pressure amplitude (half the
difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave) in units
of pascals (Pa) or $${N/m}^{2} $$ .
(We are using a lower case $$p $$ for pressure to distinguish it from power,
denoted by $$P $$ above.) The energy (as kinetic energy $$\frac{ mv^{2}}{2} $$ )
of an oscillating element of air due to a traveling sound wave is proportional
to its amplitude squared. In this equation, $$\rho $$ is the density of the
material in which the sound wave travels, in units of $${kg/m}^{3} $$ , and
$${v}\_{w} $$ is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of m/s. The pressure
variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so $$I $$
varies as $${\left( \Delta p \right)}^{2} $$
([[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). This relationship is consistent with the fact that the
sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude,
the more the air is compressed in the sound it creates.

![The image shows two graphs, with a bird positioned to the left of each one. The first graph represents a low frequency sound of a bird. The pressure variation shows small amplitude maxima and minima, represented by a sine curve of gauge pressure versus position with a small amplitude. The second graph represents a high frequency sound of a screaming bird. The pressure variation shows large amplitude maxima and minima, represented by a sine curve of gauge pressure versus position with a large amplitude.](../resources/Figure_17_03_02.jpg 'Graphs of the gauge pressures in two sound waves of different intensities. The more intense sound is produced by a source that has larger-amplitude oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters.')
{: #Figure2}

Sound intensity levels are quoted in decibels (dB) much more often than sound
intensities in watts per meter squared. Decibels are the unit of choice in the
scientific literature as well as in the popular media. The reasons for this
choice of units are related to how we perceive sounds. How our ears perceive
sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the intensity rather
than directly to the intensity. The **sound intensity level** $$\beta $$ in
decibels of a sound having an intensity $$I $$ in watts per meter squared is
defined to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$\beta  \left(\text{dB}\right)=10 {\text{log}}_{10}\left(\frac{I}{ {I}_{0}}\right), $$
</div>

where $${I}_{0}=10^{-12} {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ is a reference intensity. In
particular, $${I}_{0} $$ is the lowest or threshold intensity of sound a person
with normal hearing can perceive at a frequency of 1000 Hz. Sound intensity
level is not the same as intensity. Because $$\beta $$ is defined in terms of a
ratio, it is a unitless quantity telling you the _level_ of the sound relative
to a fixed standard ( $$10^{-12} {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ , in this case). The units
of decibels (dB) are used to indicate this ratio is multiplied by 10 in its
definition. The bel, upon which the decibel is based, is named for Alexander
Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.

The decibel level of a sound having the threshold intensity of $$10^{-12}
{\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ is $$\beta =0 \text{dB} $$ , because $${\text{log}}\_{10}1=0

$$
. That is, the threshold of hearing is 0 decibels. [[Table 1]](#Table1) gives
levels in decibels and intensities in watts per meter squared for some familiar
sounds.

One of the more striking things about the intensities in [[Table 1]](#Table1) is
that the intensity in watts per meter squared is quite small for most sounds.
The ear is sensitive to as little as a trillionth of a watt per meter
squared—even more impressive when you realize that the area of the eardrum is
only about $$1 \text{cm}^{2} $$ , so that only $$10^{-16} $$ W falls on it at
the threshold of hearing! Air molecules in a sound wave of this intensity
vibrate over a distance of less than one molecular diameter, and the gauge
pressures involved are less than $$10^{-9} $$ atm.

Another impressive feature of the sounds in [[Table 1]](#Table1) is their
numerical range. Sound intensity varies by a factor of $$ 10^{12} $$ from
threshold to a sound that causes damage in seconds. You are unaware of this
tremendous range in sound intensity because how your ears respond can be
described approximately as the logarithm of intensity. Thus, sound intensity
levels in decibels fit your experience better than intensities in watts per
meter squared. The decibel scale is also easier to relate to because most people
are more accustomed to dealing with numbers such as 0, 53, or 120 than numbers
such as $$ 1.00 \times 10^{-11} $$.

One more observation readily verified by examining [[Table 1]](#Table1) or using
$$I={\frac{\left(\Delta p\right)}{2{\text{ρv}}_{\text{w}}}}^{2} $$ is that each
factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound
compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or three factors of 10 (that is,
$$10^{3} $$ times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is $$10^{7}
$$ as intense as another, it is 70 dB higher. See [[Table 2]](#Table2).

Calculating Sound Intensity Levels: Sound Waves
</div>
Calculate the sound intensity level in decibels for a sound wave traveling in air at  $$0ºC $$
 and having a pressure amplitude of 0.656 Pa.

**Strategy**

We are given $$\Delta p $$ , so we can calculate $$I $$ using the equation
$$I={\left(\Delta p\right)}^{2}/{\left(2{\text{pv}}_{w}\right)}^{2} $$ . Using
$$I $$ , we can calculate $$\beta $$ straight from its definition in $$\beta
\left(\text{dB}\right)=10 {\text{log}}_{10}\left(I/{I}_{0}\right) $$.

**Solution**

(1) Identify knowns:

Sound travels at 331 m/s in air at $$0ºC $$.

Air has a density of $$1.29 \text{kg/m}^{3} $$ at atmospheric pressure and $$0ºC
$$.

(2) Enter these values and the pressure amplitude into $$I={\left(\Delta
p\right)}^{2}/\left({2\text{ρv}}_{w}\right) $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{ {\left(\Delta p\right)}^{2}}{2{\text{ρv}}_{w}}=\frac{ {\left(0.656 Pa\right)}^{2}}{2\left( 1.29 {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)}= 5.04 \times 10^{-4}  {\text{W/m}}^{2}. $$
</div>
(3) Enter the value for  $$I $$
 and the known value for  $${I}_{0} $$
 into  $$\beta  \left(\text{dB}\right)=10 {\text{log}}_{10}\left(I/{I}_{0}\right) $$ .
 Calculate to find the sound intensity level in decibels:

<div class="equation" >
 $$10 \log_{10}\left(5.04 \times 10^{8} \right)=10 \left(8.70\right) dB=87 dB. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This 87 dB sound has an intensity five times as great as an 80 dB sound. So a
factor of five in intensity corresponds to a difference of 7 dB in sound
intensity level. This value is true for any intensities differing by a factor of
five.

<div class="title">
Change Intensity Levels of a Sound: What Happens to the Decibel Level?
</div>
Show that if one sound is twice as intense as another, it has a sound level about 3 dB higher.

**Strategy**

You are given that the ratio of two intensities is 2 to 1, and are then asked to
find the difference in their sound levels in decibels. You can solve this
problem using of the properties of logarithms.

**Solution**

(1) Identify knowns:

The ratio of the two intensities is 2 to 1, or:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {I}_{2}}{ {I}_{1}}= 2.00. $$
</div>
We wish to show that the difference in sound levels is about 3 dB. That is, we want to show:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\beta }_{2}-{\beta }_{1}=3 \text{dB}. $$
</div>
Note that:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{log}}_{10}b-{\text{log}}_{10}a={\text{log}}_{10}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>
(2) Use the definition of  $$\beta  $$
 to get:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\beta }_{2}-{\beta }_{1}={10 \text{log}}_{10}\left(\frac{ {I}_{2}}{ {I}_{1}}\right)=10 {\text{log}}_{10}2.00=10 \left( 0.301\right) \text{dB}. $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\beta }_{2}-{\beta }_{1}=3.01\text{ dB}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This means that the two sound intensity levels differ by 3.01 dB, or about 3 dB,
as advertised. Note that because only the ratio $${I}_{2}/{I}_{1} $$ is given (
and not the actual intensities), this result is true for any intensities that
differ by a factor of two. For example, a 56.0 dB sound is twice as intense as a
53.0 dB sound, a 97.0 dB sound is half as intense as a 100 dB sound, and so on.

</div>

It should be noted at this point that there is another decibel scale in use,
called the **sound pressure level**, based on the ratio of the pressure
amplitude to a reference pressure. This scale is used particularly in
applications where sound travels in water. It is beyond the scope of most
introductory texts to treat this scale because it is not commonly used for
sounds in air, but it is important to note that very different decibel levels
may be encountered when sound pressure levels are quoted. For example, ocean
noise pollution produced by ships may be as great as 200 dB expressed in the
sound pressure level, where the more familiar sound intensity level we use here
would be something under 140 dB for the same sound.

### Section Summary

* Intensity is the same for a sound wave as was defined for all waves; it is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$I=\frac{P}{A}, $$
  </div>
     where  $$P $$
     is the power crossing area  $$A $$ .   The SI unit for  $$I $$
     is watts per meter squared. The intensity of a sound wave is also related to the pressure amplitude  $$\Delta p $$
    <div class="equation" >
   $$I=\frac{ {\left(\Delta p\right)}^{2}}{2{\text{ρv}}_{w}}, $$
  </div>

where $$\rho $$ is the density of the medium in which the sound wave travels and
$${v}_{w} $$ is the speed of sound in the medium.

* Sound intensity level in units of decibels (dB) is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\beta  \left(\text{dB}\right)=10 {\text{log}}_{10}\left(\frac{I}{ {I}_{0}}\right), $$
  </div>

What is the intensity in watts per meter squared of 85.0-dB sound?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We are given the sound intensity level in decibels and need to find the intensity in W/m². We use the decibel formula $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$ and solve for $$I$$.

**Solution**

Given:
- Sound intensity level: $$\beta = 85.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

Rearranging the decibel formula:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\beta}{10} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$10^{\beta/10} = \frac{I}{I_0}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = I_0 \times 10^{\beta/10}$$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
$$I = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{85.0/10} = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{8.50} = 10^{-12+8.50} \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-3.50} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 3.16 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The intensity of $$3.16 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m² is a relatively small amount of power per unit area, yet it produces a sound that is loud enough to potentially cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure (85 dB is near the threshold where hearing protection is recommended for 8-hour exposures). This demonstrates the remarkable sensitivity of the human ear, which can detect sounds over a tremendous range of intensities—from the threshold of hearing at $$10^{-12}$$ W/m² to sounds that cause pain and damage. The 85 dB level is typical of heavy traffic, a noisy office, or a loud radio.

The intensity of an 85.0-dB sound is $$3.16 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m².

The warning tag on a lawn mower states that it produces noise at a level of 91.0 dB. What is this in watts per meter squared?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We convert from decibels to intensity using the relationship $$I = I_0 \times 10^{\beta/10}$$, where $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m².

**Solution**

Given:
- Sound intensity level: $$\beta = 91.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

Using the formula:

<div class="equation">
$$I = I_0 \times 10^{\beta/10} = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{91.0/10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{9.10} = 10^{-12+9.10} \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-2.90} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 1.26 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

A lawn mower producing 91 dB is quite loud—this level is in the range where prolonged exposure can cause hearing damage (above 90 dB). The intensity of $$1.26 \times 10^{-3}$$ W/m² is about 4 times greater than the 85 dB sound we calculated in the previous problem, which makes sense since 91 dB is 6 dB higher, and 6 dB corresponds to approximately a factor of 4 in intensity (since 10 dB is a factor of 10, and $$10^{0.6} \approx 4$$). This is why lawn mower operators and landscapers often wear hearing protection. The warning tag is important because regular exposure to this noise level without protection can lead to permanent hearing loss.

The lawn mower produces sound with an intensity of $$1.26 \times 10^{-3}$$ W/m².

A sound wave traveling in  $$20ºC $$
 air has a pressure amplitude of 0.5 Pa. What is the intensity of the wave?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We are given the pressure amplitude $$\Delta p$$ and need to find the intensity $$I$$. We use the relationship between intensity and pressure amplitude: $$I = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2\rho v_w}$$. For air at 20°C, we use $$\rho = 1.29$$ kg/m³ and $$v_w = 343$$ m/s.

**Solution**

Given:
- Pressure amplitude: $$\Delta p = 0.5 \text{ Pa}$$
- Temperature: $$T = 20°C$$
- For air at 20°C: $$\rho = 1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3$$, $$v_w = 343 \text{ m/s}$$

Using the intensity-pressure relationship:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2\rho v_w}$$

Substituting the values:

Since $$1 \text{ Pa} = 1 \text{ N/m}^2 = 1 \text{ kg/(m·s}^2\text{)}$$, we have $$\text{Pa}^2 = \text{kg}^2/(\text{m}^2\text{·s}^4)$$:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{0.25 \text{ kg}^2/(\text{m}^2\text{·s}^4)}{885.14 \text{ kg/(m·s)}} = \frac{0.25}{885.14} \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m·s}^3} = 2.82 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg/(m·s}^3\text{)}$$
</div>

Since $$\text{kg/(m·s}^3\text{)} = \text{W/m}^2$$:

<div class="equation">
$$I = 3.04 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The intensity of $$3.04 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m² corresponds to a moderate sound level. This pressure amplitude of 0.5 Pa is quite small—only about 5 parts per million of atmospheric pressure ($$10^5$$ Pa)—yet it produces a clearly audible sound. This demonstrates the remarkable sensitivity of the human ear to tiny pressure variations. The quadratic relationship between pressure amplitude and intensity means that doubling the pressure amplitude would quadruple the intensity. This makes physical sense because both the kinetic and potential energy densities in the wave are proportional to the square of the amplitude.

The intensity of the sound wave is $$3.04 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m².

What intensity level does the sound in the preceding problem correspond to?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We found in the previous problem that the intensity is $$I = 3.04 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m². Now we need to convert this to a sound intensity level in decibels using the formula $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$, where $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m² is the reference intensity (threshold of hearing).

**Solution**

Given:
- Intensity from previous problem: $$I = 3.04 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/m}^2$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

Using the decibel formula:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$$

Substituting the values:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{3.04 \times 10^{-4}}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10\log_{10}(3.04 \times 10^{8})$$
</div>

Using the logarithm property $$\log_{10}(ab) = \log_{10}a + \log_{10}b$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10[\log_{10}(3.04) + \log_{10}(10^{8})]$$

<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10[0.483 + 8] = 10(8.483) = 84.8 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The sound intensity level of approximately 85 dB corresponds to sounds like heavy traffic, a noisy factory, or a loud vacuum cleaner. According to occupational safety standards, prolonged exposure to sounds at this level (8 hours or more) can cause hearing damage, which is why hearing protection is recommended for people who work in such environments.

Note that the intensity of $$3.04 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m² is $$3.04 \times 10^{8}$$ times greater than the threshold of hearing—a factor of over 300 million! Yet on the logarithmic decibel scale, this translates to only 85 dB. This illustrates why the decibel scale is so useful: it compresses the enormous range of sound intensities we can perceive into a manageable numerical range.

The sound intensity level is approximately 85 dB.

We are given the intensity and need to find the sound intensity level in decibels. We use the decibel formula $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$, where $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m².

**Solution**

**Discussion**

A sound intensity level of 106 dB is extremely loud and well above the threshold for hearing damage. This level is comparable to a chainsaw at close range, a rock concert, or a jackhammer. According to hearing safety guidelines, exposure to 106 dB should be limited to less than 4 minutes per day to prevent permanent hearing damage.

The fact that earphones can produce this intensity level is concerning—earphones deliver sound energy directly into the ear canal with very high efficiency. An intensity of $$4.00 \times 10^{-2}$$ W/m² is $$4.00 \times 10^{10}$$ times (40 billion times) greater than the threshold of hearing. Many personal music players can reach these dangerous levels, which is why listening at moderate volumes is strongly recommended. Prolonged exposure to music at this level through earphones can cause permanent hearing loss, particularly at high frequencies.

The sound intensity level is 106 dB.

Show that an intensity of  $${10}^{-12} {W/m}^{2} $$
 is the same as  $${10}^{-16} {W/cm}^{2} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to convert between W/m² and W/cm² by converting the area unit from m² to cm². The key is to remember that 1 m = 100 cm, so $$1 \text{ m}^2 = (100 \text{ cm})^2 = 10{,}000 \text{ cm}^2 = 10^4 \text{ cm}^2$$.

**Solution**

Starting with the intensity in W/m²:

<div class="equation">
$$I = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

We need to convert m² to cm². Since $$1 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm} = 10^2 \text{ cm}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$1 \text{ m}^2 = (10^2 \text{ cm})^2 = 10^4 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$1 \text{ W/m}^2 = 1 \frac{\text{W}}{10^4 \text{ cm}^2} = 10^{-4} \text{ W/cm}^2$$
</div>

Now converting our intensity:

<div class="equation">
$$I = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2 \times \frac{10^{-4} \text{ W/cm}^2}{1 \text{ W/m}^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 10^{-12} \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/cm}^2 = 10^{-16} \text{ W/cm}^2$$

**Discussion**

This unit conversion is particularly relevant when discussing the threshold of hearing and the sensitivity of the human eardrum. The area of a typical eardrum is about 0.5 to 1 cm², making W/cm² a natural unit for discussing sound power incident on the eardrum.

At the threshold of hearing ($$10^{-12}$$ W/m² = $$10^{-16}$$ W/cm²), and with an eardrum area of about 1 cm², the total power reaching the eardrum is approximately $$10^{-16}$$ W. This is an incredibly tiny amount of power—the eardrum is sensitive enough to detect energy transfers on the order of $$10^{-16}$$ joules per second. This remarkable sensitivity allows us to hear sounds ranging from a pin drop to a jet engine, a range spanning 12 orders of magnitude in intensity.

The general conversion factor is: $$1 \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-4} \text{ W/cm}^2$$.

(a) What is the decibel level of a sound that is twice as intense as a 90.0-dB sound? (b) What is the decibel level of a sound that is one-fifth as intense as a 90.0-dB sound?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For both parts, we need to understand how changes in intensity relate to changes in decibel level. We can use the relationship $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}(I_2/I_1)$$, which follows from the definition of decibels. In part (a), $$I_2/I_1 = 2$$, and in part (b), $$I_2/I_1 = 1/5 = 0.2$$.

**Solution**

**Part (a):** Sound twice as intense

Given:
- Original sound level: $$\beta_1 = 90.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Intensity ratio: $$I_2/I_1 = 2$$

The difference in decibel levels is:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right) = 10\log_{10}(2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10(0.301) = 3.01 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 = \beta_1 + 3.01 \text{ dB} = 90.0 \text{ dB} + 3.01 \text{ dB} = 93.0 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Part (b):** Sound one-fifth as intense

Given:
- Original sound level: $$\beta_1 = 90.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Intensity ratio: $$I_2/I_1 = 1/5 = 0.2$$

The difference in decibel levels is:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right) = 10\log_{10}(0.2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}(2 \times 10^{-1}) = 10[\log_{10}(2) + \log_{10}(10^{-1})]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10[0.301 - 1] = 10(-0.699) = -6.99 \text{ dB} \approx -7.0 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 = \beta_1 - 7.0 \text{ dB} = 90.0 \text{ dB} - 7.0 \text{ dB} = 83.0 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These results illustrate important rules of thumb for decibel arithmetic:
- Doubling the intensity increases the sound level by approximately 3 dB
- Halving the intensity decreases the sound level by approximately 3 dB
- Reducing intensity to one-fifth (which is half of two-fifths, or $$1/2 \times 2/5$$) decreases the level by 7 dB

Notice that the 3-dB rule is exact to within rounding ($$\log_{10}(2) = 0.301$$). This is why you'll often hear that "3 dB is a factor of 2 in intensity." These shortcuts are useful for quick mental calculations.

An important observation: the new decibel level depends only on the ratio of intensities, not on the original intensity value. This means doubling any sound intensity always adds 3 dB, whether you're going from 30 dB to 33 dB or from 90 dB to 93 dB.

(a) The decibel level of a sound twice as intense as 90.0 dB is 93.0 dB.

(b) The decibel level of a sound one-fifth as intense as 90.0 dB is 83.0 dB.

**Strategy**

We need to work backwards from decibel differences to intensity ratios. Using the relationship $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}(I_2/I_1)$$, we can solve for the intensity ratio: $$I_2/I_1 = 10^{(\beta_2-\beta_1)/10}$$. Then we multiply by the given intensity to find the new intensity.

**Solution**

**Part (a):** Sound 7.00 dB lower

Given:
- Original intensity: $$I_1 = 4.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ W/m}^2$$
- Decibel change: $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = -7.00 \text{ dB}$$

Finding the intensity ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$-7.00 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$-0.700 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{-0.700} = 0.200$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$I_2 = 0.200 \times I_1 = 0.200 \times (4.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ W/m}^2)$$

<div class="equation">
$$I_2 = 8.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**Part (b):** Sound 3.00 dB higher

Given:
- Original intensity: $$I_1 = 4.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ W/m}^2$$
- Decibel change: $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = +3.00 \text{ dB}$$

Finding the intensity ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{(\beta_2-\beta_1)/10} = 10^{3.00/10} = 10^{0.300} = 2.00$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$I_2 = 2.00 \times I_1 = 2.00 \times (4.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ W/m}^2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I_2 = 8.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These results confirm the rules we learned in the previous problem:
- A decrease of 7 dB corresponds to reducing the intensity to 1/5 of its original value (0.200 = 1/5)
- An increase of 3 dB corresponds to doubling the intensity (factor of 2.00)

Notice that 7 dB is approximately equal to 10 dB - 3 dB, which corresponds to dividing by 10 and then multiplying by 2, giving 1/5. This makes sense: $$10^{-0.7} = 10^{-1} \times 10^{0.3} = 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2$$.

The original intensity of $$4.00 \times 10^{-9}$$ W/m² corresponds to a very quiet sound (about 36 dB). The 7-dB-lower sound at $$8.00 \times 10^{-10}$$ W/m² (29 dB) would be quieter than a whisper, while the 3-dB-higher sound at $$8.00 \times 10^{-9}$$ W/m² (39 dB) would be comparable to a quiet library.

(a) The intensity of a sound 7.00 dB lower is $$8.00 \times 10^{-10}$$ W/m².

(b) The intensity of a sound 3.00 dB higher is $$8.00 \times 10^{-9}$$ W/m².

**Strategy**

Both parts ask us to find intensity ratios from decibel differences. We use the relationship $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}(I_2/I_1)$$, which we can rearrange to $$I_2/I_1 = 10^{(\beta_2-\beta_1)/10}$$.

**Solution**

**Part (a):** Sound 17.0 dB higher

Given:
- Decibel difference: $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 17.0 \text{ dB}$$

Finding the intensity ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{(\beta_2-\beta_1)/10} = 10^{17.0/10} = 10^{1.70}$$
</div>

We can evaluate this as:

<div class="equation">
$$10^{1.70} = 10^1 \times 10^{0.70} = 10 \times 5.01 = 50.1$$
</div>

**Part (b):** Sound 23.0 dB less

Given:
- Decibel difference: $$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = -23.0 \text{ dB}$$

Finding the intensity ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{(\beta_2-\beta_1)/10} = 10^{-23.0/10} = 10^{-2.30}$$
</div>

We can evaluate this as:

<div class="equation">
$$10^{-2.30} = 10^{-2} \times 10^{-0.30} = 0.01 \times 0.501 = 5.01 \times 10^{-3}$$
</div>

Alternatively, this can be expressed as a fraction:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{1}{10^{2.30}} = \frac{1}{10^2 \times 10^{0.30}} = \frac{1}{10 \times 2 \times 10} = \frac{1}{200}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These results demonstrate the exponential relationship between decibel differences and intensity ratios:

**Part (a):** A 17-dB increase corresponds to an intensity ratio of about 50. We can verify this makes sense: 10 dB corresponds to a factor of 10, and 7 dB corresponds to a factor of about 5 (since 3 dB ≈ factor of 2, and 10 dB ≈ factor of 10, then 7 dB ≈ factor of 5). So 17 dB should give roughly $$10 \times 5 = 50$$, which matches our answer.

**Part (b):** A 23-dB decrease means the quieter sound has only 1/200th the intensity of the louder sound. This can be understood as: 20 dB corresponds to a factor of 100, and 3 dB corresponds to a factor of 2, so 23 dB corresponds to a factor of $$100 \times 2 = 200$$ in the denominator.

These large intensity ratios for relatively modest decibel differences illustrate why the logarithmic decibel scale is so useful. A difference of 17 dB might not sound enormous, but it represents a 50-fold change in intensity. Similarly, reducing a sound by 23 dB means reducing its intensity to only 0.5% of its original value.

(a) A sound 17.0 dB higher is 50.1 times more intense.

(b) If one sound is 23.0 dB less than another, the intensity ratio is $$5.01 \times 10^{-3}$$ or $$1/200$$.

**Discussion**

A negative decibel level means the sound is quieter than the reference level of $$10^{-12}$$ W/m², which is defined as the threshold of hearing at 1000 Hz for a person with normal hearing. The fact that some people can hear sounds at -8 dB at 3000 Hz demonstrates that:

1. The sensitivity of human hearing varies with frequency. At 3000 Hz (near the peak sensitivity of the human ear), people can detect sounds that are even quieter than the 1000 Hz reference level.

2. The intensity of $$1.58 \times 10^{-13}$$ W/m² is only about 16% of the standard threshold intensity ($$10^{-0.8} \approx 0.158$$).

3. The human ear is remarkably sensitive at certain frequencies. The ability to detect such faint sounds is evolutionarily advantageous—this frequency range includes important environmental cues and human speech sounds.

This exceptional sensitivity at mid-frequencies (2000-4000 Hz) is why audiologists test hearing across multiple frequencies, not just at the 1000 Hz reference point. It's also why hearing protection is crucial—once this delicate sensitivity is damaged by loud sounds, it cannot be recovered.

The intensity of a -8.00 dB sound is $$1.58 \times 10^{-13}$$ W/m².

If a large housefly 3.0 m away from you makes a noise of 40.0 dB, what is the noise level of 1000 flies at that distance, assuming interference has a negligible effect?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When multiple identical sound sources emit incoherently (with negligible interference), the total intensity is the sum of individual intensities. We first find the intensity of one fly, multiply by 1000 to get the total intensity, then convert back to decibels. The key insight is that intensities add, not decibel levels.

**Solution**

Given:
- Sound level of one fly: $$\beta_1 = 40.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Number of flies: $$N = 1000$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**Step 1:** Find the intensity of one fly.

<div class="equation">
$$I_1 = I_0 \times 10^{\beta_1/10} = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{40.0/10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I_1 = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{4.00} = 10^{-12+4} \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the total intensity from 1000 flies.

Since the flies emit incoherently, their intensities add:

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{total}} = N \times I_1 = 1000 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{total}} = 10^{3} \times 10^{-8} \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-5} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Convert the total intensity to decibels.

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_{\text{total}} = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{\text{total}}}{I_0}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_{\text{total}} = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-12}}\right) = 10\log_{10}(10^{7})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 7 = 70.0 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The result shows that 1000 flies produce 70 dB, which is 30 dB higher than one fly's 40 dB. This makes sense because:
- 1000 = $$10^3$$, which means the intensity increases by a factor of 1000
- A factor of 1000 in intensity corresponds to $$10\log_{10}(1000) = 10 \times 3 = 30$$ dB

This demonstrates an important principle: multiplying the number of identical sound sources by 10 adds 10 dB to the sound level, multiplying by 100 adds 20 dB, and multiplying by 1000 adds 30 dB.

It's crucial to understand that decibel levels don't add directly. If you have two 40-dB sources, you don't get 80 dB—you get 43 dB (since two sources double the intensity, which adds 3 dB). With 1000 sources, you add 30 dB to get 70 dB, not $$1000 \times 40 = 40{,}000$$ dB!

A sound level of 70 dB (equivalent to 1000 flies) is comparable to busy traffic or a noisy office—definitely noticeable and potentially annoying. This explains why a swarm of insects can be so loud even though an individual insect is barely audible.

The noise level of 1000 flies is 70.0 dB.

Ten cars in a circle at a boom box competition produce a 120-dB sound intensity level at the center of the circle. What is the average sound intensity level produced there by each stereo, assuming interference effects can be neglected?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is the inverse of the previous problem. We know the total sound level from all sources and need to find the level of one source. We'll convert the total decibel level to intensity, divide by the number of sources to get the intensity per source, then convert back to decibels.

**Solution**

Given:
- Total sound level: $$\beta_{\text{total}} = 120 \text{ dB}$$
- Number of stereos: $$N = 10$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**Step 1:** Find the total intensity at the center.

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{total}} = I_0 \times 10^{\beta_{\text{total}}/10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{total}} = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{120/10} = (10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2) \times 10^{12}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{total}} = 1 \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the intensity from one stereo.

Since interference is negligible, the total intensity equals the sum of individual intensities:

<div class="equation">
$$I_1 = \frac{I_{\text{total}}}{N} = \frac{1 \text{ W/m}^2}{10} = 0.1 \text{ W/m}^2 = 10^{-1} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Convert the single-source intensity to decibels.

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_1}{I_0}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{10^{-1}}{10^{-12}}\right) = 10\log_{10}(10^{11})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_1 = 10 \times 11 = 110 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Each stereo produces 110 dB, and together the ten stereos produce 120 dB—a difference of only 10 dB even though there are 10 times as many sources. This demonstrates the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale:
- 10 sources instead of 1 increases intensity by a factor of 10
- A factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB
- Therefore, $$120 \text{ dB} - 110 \text{ dB} = 10 \text{ dB}$$

This result has important practical implications. At a rock concert, if you have 10 amplifiers each producing 110 dB, you don't get $$10 \times 110 = 1100$$ dB—you only get 120 dB. Similarly, reducing the number of loud sources doesn't decrease the sound level as much as you might expect. Removing 9 out of 10 stereos would only reduce the sound level from 120 dB to 110 dB, still painfully loud.

Both 110 dB and 120 dB are at the threshold of pain and can cause immediate hearing damage. At 120 dB, hearing damage can occur in seconds, while at 110 dB, damage can occur in less than 2 minutes of exposure. This is why hearing protection is essential at such events.

Each stereo produces an average sound intensity level of 110 dB at the center of the circle.

The amplitude of a sound wave is measured in terms of its maximum gauge pressure. By what factor does the amplitude of a sound wave increase if the sound intensity level goes up by 40.0 dB?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to use the relationship between intensity and pressure amplitude: $$I \propto (\Delta p)^2$$, which comes from $$I = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2\rho v_w}$$. First, we'll find the factor by which intensity increases when the sound level increases by 40 dB. Then we'll use the square relationship to find how pressure amplitude changes.

**Solution**

Given:
- Decibel increase: $$\Delta\beta = 40.0 \text{ dB}$$

**Step 1:** Find the intensity ratio from the decibel change.

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = \beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$40.0 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$4.00 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{4.00} = 10{,}000$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Relate the intensity ratio to the pressure amplitude ratio.

From the intensity-pressure relationship:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2\rho v_w}$$
</div>

Since $$\rho$$ and $$v_w$$ are constants for a given medium:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{(\Delta p_2)^2}{(\Delta p_1)^2} = \left(\frac{\Delta p_2}{\Delta p_1}\right)^2$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta p_2}{\Delta p_1} = \sqrt{\frac{I_2}{I_1}} = \sqrt{10{,}000} = 100$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pressure amplitude increases by a factor of 100 when the sound intensity level increases by 40 dB. This makes sense because:
- 40 dB corresponds to an intensity increase of $$10^4 = 10{,}000$$
- Since intensity is proportional to the square of pressure amplitude, the pressure amplitude factor is $$\sqrt{10{,}000} = 100$$

This square-root relationship is crucial for understanding sound:
- Doubling the pressure amplitude (factor of 2) increases intensity by a factor of $$2^2 = 4$$, which is about 6 dB
- Increasing pressure amplitude by a factor of 10 increases intensity by $$10^2 = 100$$, which is 20 dB
- Increasing pressure amplitude by a factor of 100 increases intensity by $$100^2 = 10{,}000$$, which is 40 dB

This has practical implications. For example, if you want to make a sound seem "twice as loud" (which roughly corresponds to a 10 dB increase), you need to increase the intensity by a factor of 10, which requires increasing the pressure amplitude by only a factor of $$\sqrt{10} \approx 3.16$$. The speaker cone doesn't need to move 10 times as far—only about 3 times as far.

The relationship also explains why it's much easier to damage hearing with loud sounds than people realize. A sound that has a pressure amplitude 10 times greater (which might not seem extreme) actually has 100 times the intensity, a dramatic increase in energy delivery to the delicate structures of the inner ear.

The pressure amplitude increases by a factor of 100.

If a sound intensity level of 0 dB at 1000 Hz corresponds to a maximum gauge pressure (sound amplitude) of  $${10}^{-9} \text{atm} $$ ,
 what is the maximum gauge pressure in a 60-dB sound? What is the maximum gauge pressure in a 120-dB sound?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the relationship between pressure amplitude and intensity: $$\Delta p \propto \sqrt{I}$$. For each sound level, we'll find the intensity ratio relative to 0 dB, then use the square root of that ratio to find the pressure amplitude ratio. Since $$\Delta p_0 = 10^{-9}$$ atm at 0 dB, we multiply by the ratio to find the new pressure amplitude.

**Solution**

Given:
- At 0 dB: $$\Delta p_0 = 10^{-9} \text{ atm}$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$ (corresponds to 0 dB)

**Part 1:** Maximum gauge pressure at 60 dB

**Step 1:** Find the intensity at 60 dB.

<div class="equation">
$$I_{60} = I_0 \times 10^{\beta/10} = I_0 \times 10^{60/10} = I_0 \times 10^6$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Find the pressure amplitude ratio.

Since $$I \propto (\Delta p)^2$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_{60}}{I_0} = \left(\frac{\Delta p_{60}}{\Delta p_0}\right)^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta p_{60}}{\Delta p_0} = \sqrt{\frac{I_{60}}{I_0}} = \sqrt{10^6} = 10^3 = 1000$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Calculate the pressure amplitude at 60 dB.

$$\Delta p_{60} = 1000 \times \Delta p_0 = 1000 \times 10^{-9} \text{ atm} = 10^{-6} \text{ atm}$$

**Part 2:** Maximum gauge pressure at 120 dB

**Step 1:** Find the intensity at 120 dB.

**Step 3:** Calculate the pressure amplitude at 120 dB.

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta p_{120} = 10^6 \times \Delta p_0 = 10^6 \times 10^{-9} \text{ atm} = 10^{-3} \text{ atm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These results dramatically illustrate the range of pressure variations our ears can detect:

**At 60 dB (normal conversation):** The pressure amplitude is $$10^{-6}$$ atm, which is one millionth of atmospheric pressure. This is only 1000 times greater than the threshold of hearing ($$10^{-9}$$ atm), yet it's sufficient for clear communication.

**At 120 dB (threshold of pain):** The pressure amplitude is $$10^{-3}$$ atm, which is one thousandth of atmospheric pressure (about 0.1% of $$P_{\text{atm}}$$). This is still a remarkably small variation, yet it causes physical pain and immediate hearing damage.

The progression is striking:
- 0 dB → 60 dB: Intensity increases by $$10^6$$, pressure by $$10^3$$ (factor of 1000)
- 60 dB → 120 dB: Intensity increases by another $$10^6$$, pressure by another $$10^3$$ (factor of 1000)
- 0 dB → 120 dB: Intensity increases by $$10^{12}$$, pressure by $$10^6$$ (factor of 1 million)

This means our ears can detect pressure oscillations over a range of one million to one—from $$10^{-9}$$ atm to $$10^{-3}$$ atm. Even at the pain threshold, the pressure variation is only 0.1% of atmospheric pressure, yet the energy is sufficient to damage the delicate hair cells in the cochlea. This explains why hearing loss from loud music or machinery is such a common problem—the pressures involved seem small, but the energy is devastating to the sensitive structures of the inner ear.

The maximum gauge pressure in a 60-dB sound is $$10^{-6}$$ atm.

The maximum gauge pressure in a 120-dB sound is $$10^{-3}$$ atm.

An 8-hour exposure to a sound intensity level of 90.0 dB may cause hearing damage. What energy in joules falls on a 0.800-cm-diameter eardrum so exposed?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Energy is related to power and time by $$E = Pt$$, and intensity is power per unit area: $$I = P/A$$. We'll first convert the decibel level to intensity, then calculate the area of the eardrum, use these to find the power reaching the eardrum, and finally multiply by time to get the total energy.

**Solution**

Given:
- Sound intensity level: $$\beta = 90.0 \text{ dB}$$
- Eardrum diameter: $$d = 0.800 \text{ cm} = 0.800 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$$
- Exposure time: $$t = 8 \text{ hours} = 8 \times 3600 \text{ s} = 28{,}800 \text{ s}$$
- Reference intensity: $$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**Step 1:** Find the intensity from the decibel level.

<div class="equation">

</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the area of the eardrum.

The eardrum is approximately circular with diameter $$d$$:

<div class="equation">
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.800 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}}{2}\right)^2$$

$$A = 5.03 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2$$

**Step 3:** Calculate the power incident on the eardrum.

<div class="equation">
$$P = 5.03 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W}$$

**Step 4:** Calculate the total energy over 8 hours.

<div class="equation">
$$E = Pt = (5.03 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W})(28{,}800 \text{ s})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$E = 1.45 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The total energy of $$1.45 \times 10^{-3}$$ J (about 1.5 millijoules) seems remarkably small—less than the energy needed to lift a paperclip one centimeter! Yet this tiny amount of energy, delivered continuously over 8 hours to the delicate structures of the inner ear, is sufficient to cause permanent hearing damage.

This illustrates several important points:

1. **Cumulative damage:** It's not just the instantaneous power that matters, but the total energy delivered over time. The continuous exposure allows energy to accumulate in the cochlea, causing metabolic stress and physical damage to hair cells.

2. **Biological sensitivity:** The hair cells in the cochlea are exquisitely sensitive but also fragile. The energy that seems trivial from a physics perspective is substantial from a biological perspective when concentrated on structures that are only micrometers in size.

3. **Power comparison:** The power of $$5.03 \times 10^{-8}$$ W is about 50 nanowatts—incredibly small. For comparison, a typical LED might use 0.1 W, which is 2 million times more power. Yet our ears are so sensitive that even this nanowatt-level power can cause damage with prolonged exposure.

4. **Occupational safety:** This is why OSHA and other safety organizations set strict limits on noise exposure. Workers in environments with 90 dB sound levels are required to use hearing protection or limit exposure time to prevent accumulating this damaging energy dose.

The energy incident on the eardrum during an 8-hour exposure to 90.0 dB is $$1.45 \times 10^{-3}$$ J.

(a) Ear trumpets were never very common, but they did aid people with hearing losses by gathering sound over a large area and concentrating it on the smaller area of the eardrum. What decibel increase does an ear trumpet produce if its sound gathering area is  $$900 \text{cm}^{2} $$
 and the area of the eardrum is  $$0.500 \text{cm}^{2} $$ ,
 but the trumpet only has an efficiency of 5.00% in transmitting the sound to the eardrum? (b) Comment on the usefulness of the decibel increase found in part (a).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The ear trumpet collects sound power over its large collecting area and delivers a fraction of it (determined by efficiency) to the smaller eardrum area. The intensity increase at the eardrum is the ratio of delivered power to eardrum area compared to the original intensity. We calculate the power gain, find the intensity ratio, then convert to decibels.

**Solution**

**(a) Decibel increase**

Given:
- Collecting area: $$A_{\text{collect}} = 900 \text{ cm}^2$$
- Eardrum area: $$A_{\text{ear}} = 0.500 \text{ cm}^2$$
- Efficiency: $$\eta = 5.00\% = 0.0500$$

**Step 1:** Calculate the power collected by the trumpet.

If the sound has intensity $$I_0$$, the power collected is:

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{collect}} = I_0 \times A_{\text{collect}} = I_0 \times 900 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the power delivered to the eardrum.

With efficiency $$\eta$$:

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{delivered}} = \eta \times P_{\text{collect}} = 0.0500 \times I_0 \times 900 \text{ cm}^2 = 45 I_0 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Calculate the intensity at the eardrum with the trumpet.

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{trumpet}} = \frac{P_{\text{delivered}}}{A_{\text{ear}}} = \frac{45 I_0 \text{ cm}^2}{0.500 \text{ cm}^2} = 90 I_0$$
</div>

Without the trumpet, the intensity at the eardrum would be $$I_0$$.

**Step 4:** Calculate the decibel increase.

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{\text{trumpet}}}{I_0}\right) = 10\log_{10}(90)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}(9 \times 10) = 10[\log_{10}(9) + \log_{10}(10)]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10[0.954 + 1] = 10(1.954) = 19.5 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**(b) Comment on usefulness**

A gain of 19.5 dB is quite significant and would be very helpful for people with hearing loss. To understand the usefulness:

- A 20-dB increase corresponds to multiplying the intensity by 100, making sounds much easier to hear
- For someone with moderate hearing loss (typically 40-60 dB deficit), this 19.5 dB boost could make the difference between not hearing a conversation at all and being able to follow it with some difficulty
- The increase is comparable to the difference between a quiet room (40 dB) and normal conversation (60 dB)

However, there are limitations:
- The ear trumpet only works for sounds coming from the direction it's pointed
- It's bulky and conspicuous to use
- Modern hearing aids provide 30-50 dB of amplification, can be tuned to specific frequencies, and are much smaller
- The trumpet provides no frequency selectivity—it amplifies all frequencies equally, unlike modern hearing aids that can compensate for frequency-specific hearing loss

Despite these limitations, before electronic hearing aids were invented, a 19.5 dB gain was quite valuable and could significantly improve quality of life for people with hearing loss.

**Discussion**

The calculation shows how the ear trumpet works as a simple acoustic amplifier. The large collecting area (900 cm²) gathers sound power over an area 1800 times larger than the eardrum (0.500 cm²). Even with only 5% efficiency, this results in a 90-fold intensity increase.

The relatively low efficiency (5%) accounts for losses due to:
- Sound reflection at impedance mismatches in the trumpet
- Sound absorption by the trumpet walls
- Diffraction and scattering effects
- Poor coupling between the trumpet and the ear canal

The ear trumpet demonstrates an important principle: you can increase sound intensity at a receiver by using a larger collecting area, similar to how satellite dishes and radio telescopes work. Modern acoustic devices like hearing aids use electronic amplification instead, but the basic principle of collecting more sound energy remains important in applications like parabolic microphones and acoustic mirrors.

(a) The ear trumpet produces a decibel increase of 19.5 dB.

(b) This is a significant and useful increase that would substantially help people with moderate hearing loss, though modern hearing aids provide superior performance.

Sound is more effectively transmitted into a stethoscope by direct contact than through the air, and it is further intensified by being concentrated on the smaller area of the eardrum. It is reasonable to assume that sound is transmitted into a stethoscope 100 times as effectively compared with transmission though the air. What, then, is the gain in decibels produced by a stethoscope that has a sound gathering area of  $$15.0 \text{cm}^{2} $$ ,
 and concentrates the sound onto two eardrums with a total area of  $$0.900 \text{cm}^{2} $$
 with an efficiency of 40.0%?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The stethoscope provides amplification through three mechanisms: (1) enhanced transmission through direct contact (100× factor), (2) collecting sound over a larger area, and (3) concentrating it onto the smaller eardrum area with some efficiency. We calculate the total intensity gain by multiplying all these factors, then convert to decibels.

**Solution**

Given:
- Direct contact enhancement: factor of 100
- Collecting area: $$A_{\text{collect}} = 15.0 \text{ cm}^2$$
- Total eardrum area (both ears): $$A_{\text{ear}} = 0.900 \text{ cm}^2$$
- Efficiency: $$\eta = 40.0\% = 0.400$$

**Step 1:** Calculate the power collected through direct contact.

If sound in air has intensity $$I_0$$, direct contact provides 100 times more effective transmission:

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{collect}} = 100 \times I_0 \times A_{\text{collect}} = 100 \times I_0 \times 15.0 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the power delivered to the eardrums.

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{delivered}} = \eta \times P_{\text{collect}} = 0.400 \times 100 \times I_0 \times 15.0 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{delivered}} = 600 I_0 \text{ cm}^2$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Calculate the intensity at the eardrums.

<div class="equation">
$$I_{\text{steth}} = \frac{P_{\text{delivered}}}{A_{\text{ear}}} = \frac{600 I_0 \text{ cm}^2}{0.900 \text{ cm}^2} = \frac{600}{0.900} I_0 = 667 I_0$$
</div>

**Step 4:** Calculate the decibel gain.

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{\text{steth}}}{I_0}\right) = 10\log_{10}(667)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}(6.67 \times 10^{2}) = 10[\log_{10}(6.67) + 2]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10[0.824 + 2] = 10(2.824) = 28.2 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The stethoscope provides a remarkable 28.2 dB gain through the combination of:

1. **Direct contact (100× = 20 dB):** Sound travels much more efficiently through solid materials than through air. When the stethoscope chest piece is pressed against the body, sound is transmitted directly through tissue and the metal/plastic of the device, avoiding the large impedance mismatch that occurs at the air-skin interface. This accounts for the bulk of the amplification.

2. **Area concentration (15.0/0.900 = 16.7× ≈ 12 dB):** The stethoscope collects sound over its 15.0 cm² chest piece and funnels it to the smaller total eardrum area of 0.900 cm².

3. **Efficiency loss (40%):** Not all collected sound reaches the eardrums—some is lost to absorption and scattering in the tubing. This 40% efficiency reduces the gain by about 4 dB.

The net result (20 dB + 12 dB - 4 dB ≈ 28 dB) represents an intensity increase of about 670 times, which is crucial for detecting faint heart sounds, lung sounds, and blood flow through arteries. These sounds typically range from 20-100 Hz for heart sounds and up to 2000 Hz for lung sounds, and they would be nearly inaudible without amplification.

This is why stethoscopes are essential diagnostic tools—they make the difference between hearing a faint heart murmur that indicates a serious valve problem and missing it entirely. Modern electronic stethoscopes can provide even greater amplification (40-50 dB) and filter specific frequency ranges, but the traditional acoustic stethoscope remains effective due to its impressive 28-dB passive amplification.

The stethoscope produces a gain of 28.2 dB.

Loudspeakers can produce intense sounds with surprisingly small energy input in spite of their low efficiencies.

$$A = \pi (0.0600 \text{ m})^2 = \pi \times 3.60 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$A = 1.13 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Calculate the acoustic power output.

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{acoustic}} = I \times A = (1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W/m}^2)(1.13 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{acoustic}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-5} \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Step 4:** Calculate the electrical power input.

Since efficiency is defined as:

<div class="equation">
$$\eta = \frac{P_{\text{acoustic}}}{P_{\text{input}}}$$
</div>

We can solve for input power:

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{input}} = \frac{P_{\text{acoustic}}}{\eta} = \frac{1.13 \times 10^{-5} \text{ W}}{0.0100}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$P_{\text{input}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W} = 1.13 \text{ mW}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The required electrical input power is only 1.13 milliwatts—an astonishingly small amount of power! This demonstrates several important points:

**Why so little power is needed:**
1. **90 dB is measured at the speaker surface:** The intensity decreases rapidly with distance from the speaker (as $$1/r^2$$), so this represents the maximum intensity, right at the source.

2. **Small speaker area:** The 12-cm diameter gives an area of only $$1.13 \times 10^{-2}$$ m² (about 113 cm²). The total acoustic power is intensity times area, so the small area limits the total power.

3. **Human ear sensitivity:** Our ears are remarkably sensitive. Even the small acoustic power of 11.3 microwatts produces a sound level (90 dB) that can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure.

**Why efficiency is so low (1%):**
Most of the electrical input power is converted to heat rather than sound. The losses occur due to:
- Electrical resistance in the voice coil
- Mechanical friction and damping
- Impedance mismatch between the speaker cone and air
- Energy stored in the speaker's magnetic field

Even with 99% of the input power wasted as heat, the 1% that becomes acoustic power (11.3 μW) is sufficient to produce a loud, potentially damaging sound.

**Practical implications:**
This is why small battery-powered speakers and earbuds can operate for hours on tiny batteries—they need very little actual power. A typical smartphone speaker might use 0.5-1 W of electrical power, but most of that becomes heat, not sound. The actual acoustic power that reaches your ears might be only 5-10 milliwatts, yet it's more than sufficient for clear audio playback.

The power input needed is $$1.13 \times 10^{-3}$$ W or 1.13 mW.
