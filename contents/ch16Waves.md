{: #Figure1}

What do we mean when we say something is a wave? The most intuitive and easiest
wave to imagine is the familiar water wave. More precisely, a **wave** is a
disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. For water
waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, perhaps created by a rock
thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound
waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps created by the
oscillating cone inside a speaker. For earthquakes, there are several types of
disturbances, including disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances
under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy
with water waves. Visualizing water waves is useful because there is more to it
than just a mental image. Water waves exhibit characteristics common to all
waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency and energy. All wave characteristics
can be described by a small set of underlying principles.

A wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created.
The simplest waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with
simple harmonic motion. Let us start by considering the simplified water wave
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)_._ The wave is an up and down disturbance of the water
surface. It causes a sea gull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as
the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under the bird. The time
for one complete up and down motion is the wave’s period $$T $$ . The wave’s
frequency is $$f=1/T $$ , as usual. The wave itself moves to the right in the
figure. This movement of the wave is actually the disturbance moving to the
right, not the water itself (or the bird would move to the right). We define **wave velocity** $${v}_{\text{w} } $$ to be the speed at which the disturbance
moves. Wave velocity is sometimes also called the _propagation velocity or propagation speed_, because the disturbance propagates from one
location to another.

<div class="title">
Misconception Alert
</div>
Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In fact, in water waves far from shore, the particles of water tend to stay in one location, save for moving in circles due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves forward through the water, but the water stays in one place. If you feel yourself pushed in an ocean, what you feel is the energy of the wave, not a rush of water.

</div>

![The figure shows an idealized ocean wave with two crests and two troughs that passes under a sea gull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has a wavelength lambda which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The height of a crest is equal to the depth of the trough that is X, therefore the total vertical distance between the top of a crest and the bottom of the trough is two-X.](../resources/Figure_16_09_02.jpg 'An idealized ocean wave passes under a sea gull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has a wavelength ( \\lambda ), which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up and down disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed ( v_\\text{W} ).')
{: #Figure2}

The water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it, called its **wavelength** $$\lambda $$ , the distance between adjacent identical parts of a
wave. ( $$\lambda $$ is the distance parallel to the direction of propagation.)
The speed of propagation $${v}_{\text{w} } $$ is the distance the wave travels in
a given time, which is one wavelength in the time of one period. In equation
form, that is

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w} }=\frac{\lambda }{T} $$
</div>

or

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w} }=f\lambda . $$
</div>

This fundamental relationship holds for all types of waves. For water waves,
$${v}_{\text{w} } $$ is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, $${v}_{\text{w} }
$$ is the speed of sound; and for visible light, $${v}_{\text{w} } $$ is the
speed of light, for example.

Take-Home Experiment: Waves in a Bowl

Fill a large bowl or basin with water and wait for the water to settle so there are no ripples. Gently drop a cork into the middle of the bowl. Estimate the wavelength and period of oscillation of the water wave that propagates away from the cork. Remove the cork from the bowl and wait for the water to settle again. Gently drop the cork at a height that is different from the first drop. Does the wavelength depend upon how high above the water the cork is dropped?

Calculate the Velocity of Wave Propagation: Gull in the Ocean
</div>
Calculate the wave velocity of the ocean wave in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) if the distance between wave crests is 10.0 m and the time for a seagull to bob up and down is 5.00 s.

**Strategy**

We are asked to find $${v}_{\text{w} } $$ . The given information tells us that
$$\lambda = 10.0 \text{m} $$ and $$T= 5.00 \text{s} $$ . Therefore, we can use
$${v}\_{\text{w} }=\frac{\lambda }{T} $$ to find the wave velocity.

**Solution**

1. Enter the known values into $${v}_{\text{w} }=\frac{\lambda }{T} $$  
   \:
   <div class="equation" >
    $${v}_{\text{w} }=\frac{10.0 \text{m} }{5.00\text{ s} }. $$
   </div>

2. Solve for $${v}_{\text{w} } $$  
   to find $${v}_{\text{w} }= 2.00 \text{ m/s.} $$

**Discussion**

This slow speed seems reasonable for an ocean wave. Note that the wave moves to
the right in the figure at this speed, not the varying speed at which the sea
gull moves up and down.

</div>

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

A simple wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place
to another. The wave in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) propagates in the horizontal
direction while the surface is disturbed in the vertical direction. Such a wave
is called a **transverse wave** or shear wave; in such a wave, the disturbance
is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, in a **longitudinal wave** or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the
direction of propagation. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) shows an example of a
longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude _X_ and is
completely independent of the speed of propagation $${v}_{\text{w} } $$.

![The figure shows a woman holding a long spring in her hand and moving it up and down causing it to move in a zigzag manner away from her. It is an example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally. The direction of motion of the wave is shown with the help of right arrows at each crest and trough.](../resources/Figure_16_09_03.jpg 'In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is in the vertical direction.')
{: #Figure3}

![The figure shows a woman standing at left pushing a long spring in to and fro motion in horizontal direction away from her without moving her hand up and down. The cord stretches and contracts back and forth. This is an example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally. At some points the spring is compressed and at some other points the spring is expanded. One contracted part is equal to the amplitude X.](../resources/Figure_16_09_04.jpg 'In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is also in the horizontal direction.')
{: #Figure4}

Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or _a combination of the two_. (Water
waves are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal. The simplified
water wave illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows no longitudinal motion
of the bird.) The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse—so
are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light.

Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic
variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have
appreciable shear strength, and thus the sound waves in them must be
longitudinal or compressional. Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and
transverse.

![The figure shows a guitar connected to an amplifier and a man holding a sheet of paper facing the speaker attached to the amplifier. The strings of the guitar when played cause transverse waves. On the other hand, the sound of the guitar creates ripples on the sheet of paper causing it to rattle in a direction that shows that the sound waves are longitudinal.](../resources/Figure_16_09_05.jpg 'The wave on a guitar string is transverse. The sound wave rattles a sheet of paper in a direction that shows the sound wave is longitudinal.')
{: #Figure5}

Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface also have both longitudinal and
transverse components (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves,
respectively). These components have important individual characteristics—they
propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have surface waves
that are similar to surface waves on water.

Storms in the South Pacific can create waves that travel all the way to the California coast, which are 12 000 km away. How long does it take them if they travel at 15.0 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the basic relationship between distance, speed, and time: $$t = \frac{d}{v_w}$$. After calculating the time in seconds, we'll convert to days for a more practical answer.

**Solution**

First, convert the distance to meters:

<div class="equation">
 $$d = 12\,000 \text{ km} = 12\,000\,000 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the time using $$t = \frac{d}{v_w}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{12\,000\,000}{15.0} = 800\,000 \text{ s}$$
</div>

Convert to days:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = 800\,000 \text{ s} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ s}} \times \frac{1 \text{ day}}{24 \text{ hr}} = \frac{800\,000}{86\,400} = 9.26 \text{ days}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

It takes over 9 days for waves generated by storms in the South Pacific to reach California. This is reasonable considering the vast distance (12,000 km) and the relatively modest wave speed (15.0 m/s, or about 54 km/h). Ocean waves can travel thousands of kilometers across open water with minimal energy loss, which is why surfers on the California coast can ride waves generated by distant storms. This long travel time also explains why wave forecasting requires monitoring weather conditions far out at sea.

**Answer**

9.26 days

Waves on a swimming pool propagate at 0.750 m/s. You splash the water at one end of the pool and observe the wave go to the opposite end, reflect, and return in 30.0 s. How far away is the other end of the pool?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The wave travels to the far end and back, so the total distance is twice the pool length. Using $$d = v_w t$$, we can find the total distance, then divide by 2.

**Solution**

Total distance traveled:

<div class="equation">
 $$d_{\text{total}} = v_w t = (0.750)(30.0) = 22.5 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Pool length:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = \frac{d_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{22.5}{2} = 11.25 \text{ m} = 11.3 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pool is 11.3 m (about 37 feet) long, which is reasonable for a swimming pool. The wave speed of 0.750 m/s is typical for water waves in a pool. This method of using wave reflections to measure distance is similar to sonar and radar techniques.

Wind gusts create ripples on the ocean that have a wavelength of 5.00 cm and propagate at 2.00 m/s. What is their frequency?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the wave equation $${v}_w = f\lambda$$ and solve for frequency: $$f = \frac{v_w}{\lambda}$$. First, we need to convert the wavelength to meters.

**Solution**

Convert the wavelength to meters:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = 5.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the frequency:

<div class="equation">
 $$f = \frac{v_w}{\lambda} = \frac{2.00}{0.0500} = 40.0 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ripples have a frequency of 40.0 Hz, meaning 40 wave crests pass a given point each second. This is a relatively high frequency for water waves, which makes sense given the small wavelength (5.00 cm). These small, high-frequency ripples are typical of wind-generated capillary waves on the ocean surface. The relationship $$f = v/\lambda$$ shows that for a given wave speed, shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequencies—a fundamental property of all wave phenomena.

40.0 Hz

How many times a minute does a boat bob up and down on ocean waves that have a wavelength of 40.0 m and a propagation speed of 5.00 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The frequency of bobbing equals the wave frequency. We use $$v_w = f\lambda$$ to find the frequency in Hz, then convert to bobs per minute.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
 $$f = \frac{v_w}{\lambda} = \frac{5.00}{40.0} = 0.125 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Convert to times per minute:

<div class="equation">
 $$f = 0.125 \text{ Hz} \times 60 \text{ s/min} = 7.50 \text{ bobs/min}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The boat bobs up and down 7.50 times per minute, or about once every 8 seconds. This relatively slow bobbing is characteristic of long-wavelength ocean waves. The boat's vertical motion follows the wave frequency—each wave crest that passes lifts the boat once.

Scouts at a camp shake the rope bridge they have just crossed and observe the wave crests to be 8.00 m apart. If they shake the bridge twice per second, what is the propagation speed of the waves?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The scouts shake the bridge twice per second, which means the frequency is $$f = 2.00$$ Hz. The wavelength is the distance between wave crests, $$\lambda = 8.00$$ m. We use the wave equation $${v}_w = f\lambda$$ to find the propagation speed.

**Solution**

The frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f = 2 \text{ shakes/second} = 2.00 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Using the wave equation:

<div class="equation">
 $${v}_w = f\lambda = (2.00)(8.00) = 16.0 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The waves propagate along the rope bridge at 16.0 m/s (about 58 km/h). This is a reasonable speed for waves on a tensioned rope or cable bridge. The wave speed depends on the tension in the rope and its mass per unit length—higher tension and lower mass density result in faster waves. The scouts create waves by shaking the bridge at 2 Hz, and these disturbances travel along the bridge with this propagation speed. This is similar to how waves travel along guitar strings or other tensioned cables.

**Answer**

16.0 m/s

What is the wavelength of the waves you create in a swimming pool if you splash your hand at a rate of 2.00 Hz and the waves propagate at 0.800 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The frequency of splashing determines the wave frequency. We use $$v_w = f\lambda$$ to find the wavelength.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{v_w}{f} = \frac{0.800}{2.00} = 0.400 \text{ m} = 40.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

When you splash at 2 Hz (twice per second), you create waves with a wavelength of 40 cm. This means the distance between consecutive wave crests is 40 cm. The wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency—splashing faster would create shorter wavelengths, while splashing slower would create longer wavelengths.

What is the wavelength of an earthquake that shakes you with a frequency of 10.0 Hz and gets to another city 84.0 km away in 12.0 s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to find the wavelength, but we're given the frequency and information to calculate the wave speed. First, we find the wave speed from the distance and time, then use $${v}_w = f\lambda$$ to find the wavelength.

**Solution**

Calculate the wave speed from the distance and time:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_w = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{84.0 \text{ km}}{12.0 \text{ s}} = \frac{84\,000 \text{ m}}{12.0 \text{ s}} = 7\,000 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Now use the wave equation to find wavelength:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{v_w}{f} = \frac{7\,000}{10.0} = 700 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The earthquake waves have a wavelength of 700 m and travel at the impressive speed of 7,000 m/s (7.0 km/s). This speed is typical for seismic P-waves (primary or pressure waves) traveling through Earth's crust. The 10 Hz frequency means the ground shakes 10 times per second during the earthquake. The long wavelength (700 m) compared to surface structures is one reason why earthquakes can cause such widespread damage—multiple buildings experience the wave motion simultaneously. The combination of high frequency and long wavelength results in the very high propagation speed characteristic of seismic waves.

**Strategy**

We use the wave equation $$v_w = f\lambda$$ with the speed of light (radio waves are electromagnetic waves).

Your ear is capable of differentiating sounds that arrive at the ear just 1.00 ms apart. What is the minimum distance between two speakers that produce sounds that arrive at noticeably different times on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For the sounds to arrive at noticeably different times, the path difference must be at least equal to the distance sound travels in 1.00 ms. We use $$d = vt$$ where $$v$$ is the speed of sound and $$t$$ is the minimum time difference.

**Solution**

Convert the time to seconds:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta t = 1.00 \text{ ms} = 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s}$$
</div>

Calculate the minimum distance:

<div class="equation">
 $$d = v\Delta t = (340)(1.00 \times 10^{-3}) = 0.340 \text{ m} = 34.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The minimum distance between two speakers for your ear to distinguish their sounds as arriving at different times is 34.0 cm (about 13 inches). This represents the remarkable temporal resolution of human hearing. If two speakers are closer than 34 cm, sounds from them will arrive within 1 ms of each other and your ear will perceive them as simultaneous. This 1 ms resolution is crucial for sound localization—your brain uses the tiny time differences between sound arrivals at your two ears to determine the direction of sound sources. This spatial resolution of about 34 cm also explains why speaker placement in stereo systems is important for creating a good soundstage.

(a) Seismographs measure the arrival times of earthquakes with a precision of 0.100 s. To get the distance to the epicenter of the quake, they compare the arrival times of S- and P-waves, which travel at different speeds. [[Figure 6]](#Figure6)) If S- and P-waves travel at 4.00 and 7.20 km/s, respectively, in the region considered, how precisely can the distance to the source of the earthquake be determined?

{: #Figure6}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), the time difference between S- and P-wave arrivals depends on distance. We need to find how the uncertainty in time measurement (±0.100 s) translates to uncertainty in distance. For part (b), we evaluate whether this precision is adequate for detecting nuclear test ban violations.

**Solution**

(a) Let $$d$$ be the distance to the epicenter. The arrival times are:

<div class="equation">
 $$t_P = \frac{d}{v_P} = \frac{d}{7.20}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$t_S = \frac{d}{v_S} = \frac{d}{4.00}$$
</div>

The time difference is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta t = t_S - t_P = \frac{d}{4.00} - \frac{d}{7.20} = d\left(\frac{1}{4.00} - \frac{1}{7.20}\right) = d(0.250 - 0.139) = 0.111d$$
</div>

where $$d$$ is in km and $$\Delta t$$ is in seconds. Solving for $$d$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$d = \frac{\Delta t}{0.111}$$
</div>

The uncertainty in distance due to timing precision is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\delta d = \frac{\delta(\Delta t)}{0.111} = \frac{0.100}{0.111} = 0.901 \text{ km} \approx 0.90 \text{ km}$$
</div>

(b) **Discussion**: A precision of ±0.90 km (±900 m) is quite good for locating earthquake epicenters or nuclear test sites. For detecting nuclear test ban violations, this precision is generally adequate because:
- Test sites can typically be located within a region of a few square kilometers
- Multiple seismograph stations can triangulate the location, improving precision
- The goal is detection and approximate location, not pinpoint accuracy
- 900 m uncertainty is small compared to typical distances between potential test sites

However, this precision might be limiting if trying to distinguish between very closely spaced underground facilities. Additionally, uncertainties in S- and P-wave speeds (which vary with geological conditions) can significantly increase the location uncertainty, as noted in the problem.

**Answer**

(a) ±0.90 km or ±900 m

(b) This precision is generally adequate for detecting nuclear test ban violations, though uncertainties in wave speeds can further limit precision.
