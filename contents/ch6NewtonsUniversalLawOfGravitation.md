What do aching feet, a falling apple, and the orbit of the Moon have in common?
Each is caused by the gravitational force. Our feet are strained by supporting
our weight—the force of Earth’s gravity on us. An apple falls from a tree
because of the same force acting a few meters above Earth’s surface. And the
Moon orbits Earth because gravity is able to supply the necessary centripetal
force at a distance of hundreds of millions of meters. In fact, the same force
causes planets to orbit the Sun, stars to orbit the center of the galaxy, and
galaxies to cluster together. Gravity is another example of underlying
simplicity in nature. It is the weakest of the four basic forces found in
nature, and in some ways the least understood. It is a force that acts at a
distance, without physical contact, and is expressed by a formula that is valid
everywhere in the universe, for masses and distances that vary from the tiny to
the immense.

Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See [Figure 1](#Figure1). But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner Galileo Galilei had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton's contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph—it had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose a mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others. Other prominent scientists and mathematicians of the time, particularly those outside of England, were reluctant to accept Newton's principles. It took the work of another prominent philosopher, writer, and scientist, Émilie du Châtelet, to establish the Newtonian gravitation as the accurate and overarching law. Du Châtelet, who had earlier laid the foundation for the understanding of conservation of energy as well as the principle that light had no mass, translated and augmented Newton's key work. She also utilized calculus to explain gravity, which helped lead to its acceptance.

![The figure shows a graphic image of a person sitting under a tree carefully looking toward an apple falling from the tree above him. There is a view of a river behind him and an image of the Sun in the sky.](../resources/Figure_06_05_01.jpg 'According to early accounts, Newton was inspired to make the connection between falling bodies and astronomical motions when he saw an apple fall from a tree and realized that if the gravitational force could extend above the ground to a tree, it might also reach the Sun. The inspiration of Newton’s apple is a part of worldwide folklore and may even be based in fact. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying simplicity and unity in nature. Like many revolutionary discoveries, it was not immediately accepted. Prominent French scientist and philosopher Émilie du Châtelet helped establish Newton’s theory in France and mainland Europe.')

The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it
depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them. Stated in
modern language, **Newton’s universal law of gravitation** states that every
particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force along a line
joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

![The given figure shows two circular objects, one with a larger mass M on the right side, and another with a smaller mass m on the left side. A point in the center of each object is shown, with both depicting the center of mass of the objects at these points. A line is drawn joining the center of the objects and is labeled as r. Two red arrows, one each from both the center of the objects, are drawn toward each other and are labeled as F, the magnitude of the gravitational force on both the objects.](../resources/Figure_06_05_02.jpg 'Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass of these two bodies. The magnitude of the force is the same on each, consistent with Newton’s third law.')

<div class="title">
Misconception Alert
</div>
The magnitude of the force on each object (one has larger mass than the other) is the same,
consistent with Newton’s third law.

</div>

The bodies we are dealing with tend to be large. To simplify the situation we
assume that the body acts as if its entire mass is concentrated at one specific
point called the **center of mass** (
CM) , which will be further explored
in [Linear Momentum and Collisions](./ch8LinearMomentumAndCollisions)
. For two bodies having masses $$ m $$ and $$ M $$ with a distance $$ r $$
between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law of
gravitation is

<div class="equation">
 $$ F=G\frac{mM}{ r^{2}}, $$
</div>

where $$ F $$ is the magnitude of the gravitational force and $$ G $$ is a
proportionality factor called the **gravitational constant**. $$ G $$ is a
universal gravitational constant—that is, it is thought to be the same
everywhere in the universe. It has been measured experimentally to be

<div class="equation">
 $$ G=6.674 \times 10^{-11}\frac{ \N \cdot \mm}{ {\kg }^{2}} $$
</div>

in SI units. Note that the units of $$ G $$ are such that a force in newtons is
obtained from $$ F=G\frac{mM}{ r^2 } $$, when considering masses in kilograms
and distance in meters. For example, two 1.000 kg masses separated by 1.000 m
will experience a gravitational attraction of $$ 6.674 \times 10^{-11}\N $$.
This is an extraordinarily small force. The small magnitude of the gravitational
force is consistent with everyday experience. We are unaware that even large
objects like mountains exert gravitational forces on us. In fact, our body
weight is the force of attraction of the *entire Earth* on us with a mass of $$ 6\times 10^{24}\kg $$.

Recall that the acceleration due to gravity $$ g $$ is about $$ 9.80 \mss $$ on
Earth. We can now determine why this is so. The weight of an object _mg_ is the
gravitational force between it and Earth. Substituting
_mg_ for $$ F $$ in Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg =G\frac{mM}{ r^{2}}, $$
</div>

where $$ m $$ is the mass of the object, $$ M $$ is the mass of Earth, and $$ r $$
is the distance to the center of Earth (the distance between the centers of
mass of the object and Earth). See [Figure 3](#Figure3). The mass $$ m $$ of the
object cancels, leaving an equation for $$ g $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=G\frac{M}{ r^{2}}. $$
</div>

Substituting known values for Earth’s mass and radius (to three significant
figures),

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=\left(6.67 \times 10^{-11}\frac{ \N \cdot \mm}{ {\kg }^{2}}\right)×\frac{5.98 \times 10^{24}\kg }{\left(6.38 \times 10^{6}\m \right)^{2}}, $$
</div>

and we obtain a value for the acceleration of a falling body:

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=9.80\mss . $$
</div>

![The given figure shows two circular images side by side. The bigger circular image on the left shows the Earth, with a map of Africa over it in the center, and the first quadrant in the circle being a line diagram showing the layers beneath Earth&#x2019;s surface. The second circular image shows a house over the Earth&#x2019;s surface and a vertical line arrow from its center to the downward point in the circle as its radius distance from the Earth&#x2019;s surface. A similar line showing the Earth&#x2019;s radius is also drawn in the first quadrant of the first image in a slanting way from the center point to the circle path.](../resources/Figure_06_05_03.jpg "The distance between the centers of mass of Earth and an object on its surface is very nearly the same as the radius of Earth, because Earth is so much larger than the object.")
{: #Figure3}

This is the expected value *and is independent of the body’s mass*. Newton’s law
of gravitation takes Galileo’s observation that all masses fall with the same
acceleration a step further, explaining the observation in terms of a force that
causes objects to fall—in fact, in terms of a universally existing force of
attraction between masses.

Making Connections
</div>
Attempts are still being made to understand the gravitational force.
Modern physics is exploring the connections of gravity to other forces,
space, and time. General relativity alters our view of gravitation,
leading us to think of gravitation as bending space and time.

</div>

In the following example, we make a comparison similar to one made by Newton
himself. He noted that if the gravitational force caused the Moon to orbit
Earth, then the acceleration due to gravity should equal the centripetal
acceleration of the Moon in its orbit. Newton found that the two accelerations
agreed “pretty nearly.”

<div class="example" id="example1" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Earth’s Gravitational Force Is the Centripetal Force Making the Moon Move in a Curved Path
</div>
(a) Find the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity at the distance of the Moon.

(b) Calculate the centripetal acceleration needed to keep the Moon in its
orbit (assuming a circular orbit about a fixed Earth), and compare it with the
value of the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity that you have just found.

**Strategy for (a)**

This calculation is the same as the one finding the acceleration due to gravity
at Earth’s surface, except that $$ r $$ is the distance from the center of Earth
to the center of the Moon. The radius of the Moon’s nearly circular orbit is

3.84 \times 10^{8}\m $$. $$

**Solution for (a)**

Substituting known values into the expression for $$ g $$ found above,
remembering that $$ M $$ is the mass of Earth not the Moon, yields

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
g&=& G\frac{M}{ r^{2}}=\left(6.67 \times 10^{-11}\frac{ \N \cdot \mm}{ {\kg }^{2}}\right)×\frac{5.98 \times 10^{24}\kg }{\left(3.84 \times 10^{8}\m \right)^{2}}\\
g&=& 2.70 \times 10^{-3}\mss .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Strategy for (b)**

Centripetal acceleration can be calculated using either form of

<div class="equation">
$$\left.
\begin{array}{lll}
\ac&=&\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\\
\ac&=&r \omega^{2}
\end{array}\right\}$$
</div>
We choose to use the second form:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \ac =r \omega^{2}, $$
</div>
where $$ \omega $$ is the angular velocity of the Moon about Earth.

**Solution for (b)**

Given that the period (the time it takes to make one complete rotation) of the
Moon’s orbit is 27.3 days, (d) and using

<div class="equation">
 $$ 1 d \times 24\frac{ \text{hr}}{\text{d}}\times 60\frac{min}{\text{hr}}\times 60\frac{s}{\text{min}}= 86 400 \s $$ 
</div>
we see that

<div class="equation">
 $$ \omega =\frac{ \Delta \theta }{\Delta t}=\frac{2\pi \text{rad}}{\left(27.3 \text{d}\right) \left(86 400 \text{s/d}\right)}=2.66 \times 10^{-6}\frac{ \text{rad}}{\s}. $$ 
</div>
The centripetal acceleration is

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
\ac &=& r \omega^{2}=\left(3.84 \times 10^{8}\m \right)\left(2.66 \times 10^{-6}\rads \right)^{2}\\
\ac &=& 2.72\times 10^{-3} \mss .
\end{array} $$
</div>
The direction of the acceleration is toward the center of the Earth.

**Discussion**

The centripetal acceleration of the Moon found in (b) differs by less than 1%
from the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity found in (a). This agreement is
approximate because the Moon’s orbit is slightly elliptical, and Earth is not
stationary (rather the Earth-Moon system rotates about its center of mass, which
is located some 1700 km below Earth’s surface). The clear implication is that
Earth’s gravitational force causes the Moon to orbit Earth.

</div>

Why does Earth not remain stationary as the Moon orbits it? This is because, as
expected from Newton’s third law, if Earth exerts a force on the Moon, then the
Moon should exert an equal and opposite force on Earth (
see [Figure 4](#Figure4)). We do not sense the Moon’s effect on Earth’s motion,
because the Moon’s gravity moves our bodies right along with Earth but there are
other signs on Earth that clearly show the effect of the Moon’s gravitational
force as discussed
in [Satellites and Kepler\'s Laws: An Argument for Simplicity](./ch6SatellitesAndKeplersLaws)
.

![Figure a shows the Earth and the Moon around it orbiting in a circular path shown here as a circle around the Earth with an arrow over it showing the counterclockwise direction of the Moon. The center of mass of the circle is shown here with a point on the Earth that is not the Earth’s center but just right to its center. Figure b shows the Sun and the counterclockwise rotation of the Earth around it, in an elliptical path, which has wiggles. Along this path the center of mass of the Earth-Moon is also shown; it follows non-wiggled elliptical path.](../resources/Figure_06_05_04.jpg '(a) Earth and the Moon rotate approximately once a month around their common center of mass. (b) Their center of mass orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit, but Earth’s path around the Sun has “wiggles” in it. Similar wiggles in the paths of stars have been observed and are considered direct evidence of planets orbiting those stars. This is important because the planets’ reflected light is often too dim to be observed.')

### Tides

Ocean tides are one very observable result of the Moon’s gravity acting on
Earth. [Figure 5](#Figure5) is a simplified drawing of the Moon’s position relative
to the tides. Because water easily flows on Earth’s surface, a high tide is
created on the side of Earth nearest to the Moon, where the Moon’s gravitational
pull is strongest. Why is there also a high tide on the opposite side of Earth?
The answer is that Earth is pulled toward the Moon more than the water on the
far side, because Earth is closer to the Moon. So the water on the side of Earth
closest to the Moon is pulled away from Earth, and Earth is pulled away from
water on the far side. As Earth rotates, the tidal bulge (an effect of the tidal
forces between an orbiting natural satellite and the primary planet that it
orbits) keeps its orientation with the Moon. Thus there are two tides per day (
the actual tidal period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes), because the Moon
moves in its orbit each day as well).

![The given figure shows an ellipse, inside which there is a circular image of the Earth. There is a curved arrow in the lower part of the Earth’s image pointing in the counterclockwise direction. The right and left side of the ellipse are labeled as High tide and the top and bottom side are labeled as Low tide. Alongside this image a circular image of the Moon is also given with dots showing the crates over it. A vertically upwards vector from its top is also shown, which indicates the direction of the Moon’s velocity.](../resources/Figure_06_05_05.jpg 'The Moon causes ocean tides by attracting the water on the near side more than Earth, and by attracting Earth more than the water on the far side. The distances and sizes are not to scale. For this simplified representation of the Earth-Moon system, there are two high and two low tides per day at any location, because Earth rotates under the tidal bulge.')
{: #Figure5}

The Sun also affects tides, although it has about half the effect of the Moon.
However, the largest tides, called spring tides, occur when Earth, the Moon, and
the Sun are aligned. The smallest tides, called neap tides, occur when the Sun
is at a $$ 90^\circ $$ angle to the Earth-Moon alignment.

![Figure a shows an ellipse, inside which there is a circular image of the Earth. There is a curved arrow in the lower part of the Earth’s image pointing in the counterclockwise direction. Alongside this image a circular image of the Moon is also given with dots showing the crates over it. A vertically upward vector from its top is also drawn, which shows the direction of velocity. To the right side of the image, an image of the Sun is also shown, in a circular shape with pointed wiggles throughout its boundary. Figure b shows an ellipse, inside which there is a circular image of the Earth. There is a curved arrow in the lower part of the Earth’s image pointing in the counterclockwise direction. Alongside this image a circular image of the Moon is also given with dots showing the crates over it. A vertical downward vector from its bottom is also drawn, which shows the direction of velocity.

Figure c shows an ellipse, inside which there is a circular image of the Earth. There is a curved arrow in the lower part of the Earth’s image pointing in the counterclockwise direction. Alongside this image a circular image of the Moon is also given with dots showing the crates over it. A horizontal rightward vector from its right side is also drawn, which shows the direction of velocity. To the right side of the image, an image of the Sun is also shown, in a circular shape and pointed wiggles throughout its boundary.](../resources/Figure_06_05_06.jpg '(a, b) Spring tides: The highest tides occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned. (c) Neap tide: The lowest tides occur when the Sun lies at 90 degrees to the Earth-Moon alignment. Note that this figure is not drawn to scale.')
{: #Figure6}

Tides are not unique to Earth but occur in many astronomical systems. The most
extreme tides occur where the gravitational force is the strongest and varies
most rapidly, such as near black holes (
see [Figure 7](#Figure7)). A few likely candidates for black holes have been
observed in our galaxy. These have masses greater than the Sun but have
diameters only a few kilometers across. The tidal forces near them are so great
that they can actually tear matter from a companion star.

![The figure shows a star in sky near a black hole. The tidal force of the black hole is tearing the matter from the star’s surface. ](../resources/Figure_06_05_07.jpg 'A black hole is an object with such strong gravity that not even light can escape it. This black hole was created by the supernova of one star in a two-star system. The tidal forces created by the black hole are so great that it tears matter from the companion star. This matter is compressed and heated as it is sucked into the black hole, creating light and X-rays observable from Earth.')
{: #Figure7}

### ”Weightlessness” and Microgravity

In contrast to the tremendous gravitational force near black holes is the
apparent gravitational field experienced by astronauts orbiting Earth. What is
the effect of “weightlessness” upon an astronaut who is in orbit for months? Or
what about the effect of weightlessness upon plant growth? Weightlessness
doesn’t mean that an astronaut is not being acted upon by the gravitational
force. There is no “zero gravity” in an astronaut’s orbit. The term just means
that the astronaut is in free-fall, accelerating with the acceleration due to
gravity. If an elevator cable breaks, the passengers inside will be in free fall
and will experience weightlessness. You can experience short periods of
weightlessness in some rides in amusement parks.

![The figure shows some astronauts floating inside the International Space Station](../resources/Figure_06_05_08.jpg 'Astronauts experiencing weightlessness on board the International Space Station. (credit: NASA)')
{: #Figure8}

**Microgravity** refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration
of a body is small compared with that produced by Earth at its surface. Many
interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past three
decades in the presence of microgravity. Of immediate concern is the effect on
astronauts of extended times in outer space, such as at the International Space
Station. Researchers have observed that muscles will atrophy (waste away) in
this environment. There is also a corresponding loss of bone mass. Study
continues on cardiovascular adaptation to space flight. On Earth, blood pressure
is usually higher in the feet than in the head, because the higher column of
blood exerts a downward force on it, due to gravity. When standing, 70% of your
blood is below the level of the heart, while in a horizontal position, just the
opposite occurs. What difference does the absence of this pressure differential
have upon the heart?

Some findings in human physiology in space can be clinically important to the
management of diseases back on Earth. On a somewhat negative note, spaceflight
is known to affect the human immune system, possibly making the crew members
more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Experiments flown in space also have
shown that some bacteria grow faster in microgravity than they do on Earth.
However, on a positive note, studies indicate that microbial antibiotic
production can increase by a factor of two in space-grown cultures. One hopes to
be able to understand these mechanisms so that similar successes can be achieved
on the ground. In another area of physics space research, inorganic crystals and
protein crystals have been grown in outer space that have much higher quality
than any grown on Earth, so crystallography studies on their structure can yield
much better results.

Plants have evolved with the stimulus of gravity and with gravity sensors. Roots
grow downward and shoots grow upward. Plants might be able to provide a life
support system for long duration space missions by regenerating the atmosphere,
purifying water, and producing food. Some studies have indicated that plant
growth and development are not affected by gravity, but there is still
uncertainty about structural changes in plants grown in a microgravity
environment.

### The Cavendish Experiment: Then and Now

As previously noted, the universal gravitational constant $$ G $$ is determined
experimentally. This definition was first done accurately by Henry Cavendish (
1731–1810), an English scientist, in 1798, more than 100 years after Newton
published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of $$ G $$ is very
basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces
in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the
tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (
tens of kilograms at most), using apparatus like that in [Figure 9](#Figure9).
Remarkably, his value for $$ G $$ differs by less than 1% from the best modern
value.

One important consequence of knowing $$ G $$ was that an accurate value for
Earth’s mass could finally be obtained. This was done by measuring the
acceleration due to gravity as accurately as possible and then calculating the
mass of Earth $$ M $$ from the relationship Newton’s universal law of
gravitation gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg =G\frac{mM}{ r^{2}}, $$
</div>

where $$ m $$ is the mass of the object, $$ M $$ is the mass of Earth, and $$ r $$
is the distance to the center of Earth (the distance between the centers of
mass of the object and Earth). See [Figure 2](#Figure2). The mass $$ m $$ of the
object cancels, leaving an equation for $$ g $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=G\frac{M}{ r^{2}} . $$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$ M $$ yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ M=\frac{ gr^{2}}{G} . $$
</div>

So $$ M $$ can be calculated because all quantities on the right, including the
radius of Earth $$ r $$, are known from direct measurements. We shall see
in [Satellites and Kepler\'s Laws: An Argument for Simplicity](./ch6SatellitesAndKeplersLaws)
that knowing $$ G $$ also allows for the determination of astronomical masses.
Interestingly, of all the fundamental constants in physics, $$ G $$ is by far
the least well determined.

The Cavendish experiment is also used to explore other aspects of gravity. One
of the most interesting questions is whether the gravitational force depends on
substance as well as mass—for example, whether one kilogram of lead exerts the
same gravitational pull as one kilogram of water. A Hungarian scientist named
Roland von Eötvös pioneered this inquiry early in the 20th century. He found,
with an accuracy of five parts per billion, that the gravitational force does
not depend on the substance. Such experiments continue today, and have improved
upon Eötvös’ measurements. Cavendish-type experiments such as those of Eric
Adelberger and others at the University of Washington, have also put severe
limits on the possibility of a fifth force and have verified a major prediction
of general relativity—that gravitational energy contributes to rest mass.
Ongoing measurements there use a torsion balance and a parallel plate (
not spheres, as Cavendish used) to examine how Newton’s law of gravitation works
over sub-millimeter distances. On this small-scale, do gravitational effects
depart from the inverse square law? So far, no deviation has been observed.

![In the figure, there is a circular stand at the floor holding two weight bars over it attached through an inverted cup shape object fitted over the stand. The first bar over this is a horizontal flat panel and contains two spheres of mass M at its end. Just over this bar is a stick shaped bar holding two spherical objects of mass m at its end. Over to this bar is mirror at the center of the device facing east. The rotation of this device over the axis of the stand is anti-clockwise. A light source on the right side of the device emits a ray of light toward the mirror which is then reflected toward a scale bar which is on the right to the device below the light source.](../resources/Figure_06_05_09.jpg "Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between the two suspended spheres ( \( m \) ) and the two on the stand ( \( M \) ) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. Distance between the masses can be varied to check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity.")

### Problem Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) Calculate Earth’s mass given the acceleration due to gravity at the North Pole is $$ 9.807 \mss $$

and the radius of the Earth is 6372 km from center to pole.

(b) Compare this with the accepted value of $$ 5.972 \times 10^{24}\kg $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use Newton's law of universal gravitation in the form $$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$ and solve for Earth's mass $$ M $$. We know $$ g = 9.807 $$ m/s² at the North Pole and the radius $$ r = 6372 $$ km.
(b) We'll compare our calculated value with the accepted value.

**Solution**

(a) Start with the gravitational acceleration formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$
</div>

Solve for Earth's mass $$ M $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{gr^2}{G} $$
</div>

Convert radius to meters:

<div class="equation">
$$ r = 6372\text{ km} = 6.372 \times 10^6\text{ m} $$
</div>

Substitute values with $$ G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} $$ N·m²/kg²:

<div class="equation">
$$ M = \frac{(9.807\text{ m/s}^2)(6.372 \times 10^6\text{ m})^2}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}\text{ N·m}^2\text{/kg}^2} $$

(b) Compare with the accepted value:

The accepted value is $$ 5.972 \times 10^{24} $$ kg. Our calculated value of $$ 5.972 \times 10^{24} $$ kg is **identical to the accepted value to three significant figures**. This perfect agreement confirms the accuracy of both Newton's law of universal gravitation and our measurement of Earth's radius and surface gravity.

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates how Newton's law of universal gravitation can be used to determine the mass of Earth using only surface measurements. The fact that we can calculate Earth's mass so accurately from surface gravity and radius measurements is a powerful validation of Newton's gravitational theory. This same technique has been used to determine the masses of other planets, moons, and even the Sun, making universal gravitation one of the most important tools in astronomy and planetary science.

**Strategy**

We'll use Newton's law of gravitation $$ F = G\frac{mM}{r^2} $$ to find the gravitational force, then divide by mass to get acceleration $$ a = \frac{F}{m} = G\frac{M}{r^2} $$. We need the masses and distances for both the Moon and Sun.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate acceleration due to the Moon. Using:
- Mass of Moon: $$ M_{\text{Moon}} = 7.35 \times 10^{22} $$ kg

**Discussion**

The acceleration due to the Moon's gravity at Earth is $$ 3.33 \times 10^{-5} $$ m/s², while that due to the Sun is $$ 5.90 \times 10^{-3} $$ m/s². The Sun's gravitational acceleration on Earth is about 177 times stronger than the Moon's. However, tides are caused by the *gradient* (variation) in gravitational force across Earth's diameter, not the absolute magnitude. Because the Moon is much closer to Earth than the Sun, the difference in gravitational pull between the near and far sides of Earth is proportionally much greater for the Moon, making it the dominant cause of tides.

**Discussion**

The Moon's surface gravity (1.62 m/s²) is about 16.5% of Earth's gravity (9.80 m/s²). This is why astronauts could make such dramatic leaps on the lunar surface—their weight was only about 1/6 of what it is on Earth. Mars' surface gravity (3.75 m/s²) is about 38% of Earth's gravity, making it significantly stronger than the Moon's but still much weaker than Earth's. This has important implications for future Mars missions: astronauts would weigh roughly 2/5 of their Earth weight, making movement easier than on Earth but not as dramatically different as on the Moon. The relatively low gravity on both bodies also explains why neither has been able to retain a substantial atmosphere—the escape velocity is lower, allowing atmospheric gases to more easily escape into space.

(a) Calculate the acceleration due to Moon's gravity at the center of mass.

The distance from the center of mass to the Moon is:

The values are nearly identical (within 2.4%), which is expected.

**Discussion**

The gravitational acceleration due to the Moon ($$ 3.41 \times 10^{-5} $$ m/s²) and the centripetal acceleration of Earth's center ($$3.33 \times 10^{-5}$$ m/s²) are nearly equal, as they must be. At the center of mass, the gravitational attraction from the Moon provides exactly the centripetal force needed to keep Earth orbiting around that point. The small difference (about 2%) is due to rounding in our calculations and the approximation that the orbit is perfectly circular. This problem beautifully demonstrates that the Earth-Moon system is truly a binary system, with both bodies orbiting their common center of mass, rather than the Moon simply orbiting Earth. The center of mass lies inside Earth (about 1690 km below the surface) because Earth is much more massive than the Moon, but both objects orbit this point.

Solve part (b) of [Example 1](#example1) using $$ \ac =v^2/r $$.

**Strategy**

Example 1 part (b) calculated the centripetal acceleration of the Moon using $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$. Now we'll solve it using $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$ instead. We need to find the Moon's orbital velocity first using $$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$.

**Solution**

First, calculate the Moon's orbital velocity. Using:
- Orbital radius: $$ r = 3.84 \times 10^{8} $$ m
- Orbital period: $$ T = 27.3 $$ days $$ = 27.3 \times 86{,}400 $$ s $$ = 2.36 \times 10^{6} $$ s

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = \frac{2\pi(3.84 \times 10^{8}\text{ m})}{2.36 \times 10^{6}\text{ s}} = \frac{2.41 \times 10^{9}}{2.36 \times 10^{6}} = 1.02 \times 10^{3}\text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Now calculate the centripetal acceleration:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(1.02 \times 10^{3}\text{ m/s})^2}{3.84 \times 10^{8}\text{ m}} = \frac{1.04 \times 10^{6}}{3.84 \times 10^{8}} = 2.71 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m/s}^2 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Using the alternative formula $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$, we obtain $$ 2.71 \times 10^{-3} $$ m/s² for the Moon's centripetal acceleration, which matches (within rounding error) the value of $$ 2.72 \times 10^{-3} $$ m/s² found in Example 1 using $$ a_c = r\omega^2 $$. This confirms that both formulas for centripetal acceleration are equivalent and yield the same result, as expected.

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{Jupiter}} = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(7.98 \times 10^{27})}{3.96 \times 10^{23}} = \frac{5.33 \times 10^{17}}{3.96 \times 10^{23}} = 1.35 \times 10^{-6}\text{ N} $$

</div>

**Discussion**

The father's gravitational pull on the baby ($$7.01 \times 10^{-7}$$ N) is about half the gravitational pull from Jupiter ($$1.35 \times 10^{-6}$$ N), even though Jupiter is enormously more massive. This is because the father is so much closer - distance matters enormously in gravitational interactions due to the inverse-square law.

This calculation thoroughly debunks astrological claims about planetary influences at birth. If gravitational force were the mechanism by which planets influence people, then the father standing nearby would have nearly the same effect as Jupiter! Furthermore, the doctor, the hospital building, and even nearby furniture would exert comparable gravitational forces. Both forces are incredibly tiny anyway - about a millionth of a newton, which is completely negligible compared to other forces acting on the baby. This demonstrates that if planets do influence human affairs (which has never been scientifically demonstrated), it cannot be through gravitational force.

The existence of the dwarf planet Pluto was proposed based on irregularities in Neptune's orbit. Pluto was subsequently discovered near its predicted position. But it now appears that the discovery was fortuitous, because Pluto is small and the irregularities in Neptune's orbit were not well known.

**Discussion**

The acceleration due to gravity at Neptune caused by Pluto is $$ 4.6 \times 10^{-14} $$ m/s², while that caused by Uranus is $$ 9.2 \times 10^{-10} $$ m/s². Uranus produces an acceleration at Neptune that is about 20,000 times greater than that of Pluto.

Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the Sun in its galactic orbit. Does

(a) Use the relationship for centripetal acceleration $$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} $$, converting all units appropriately.
(b) Use $$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$ to find the orbital speed.

**Solution**

**Given:**
- Orbital period: $$ T = 2.60 \times 10^{8}\text{ years} $$
- Orbital radius: $$ r = 3.00 \times 10^{4}\text{ light years} $$

First, convert to SI units.

**Convert period to seconds:**
<div class="equation">
$$ T = 2.60 \times 10^{8}\text{ y} \times 3.156 \times 10^{7}\text{ s/y} = 8.21 \times 10^{15}\text{ s} $$

**Convert radius to meters:**

One light year is the distance light travels in one year:

$$ 1\text{ ly} = c \times 1\text{ y} = (3.00 \times 10^{8}\text{ m/s})(3.156 \times 10^{7}\text{ s}) = 9.47 \times 10^{15}\text{ m} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ r = 3.00 \times 10^{4}\text{ ly} \times 9.47 \times 10^{15}\text{ m/ly} = 2.84 \times 10^{20}\text{ m} $$
</div>

**(a) Centripetal acceleration:**

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} = \frac{4\pi^2 (2.84 \times 10^{20}\text{ m})}{(8.21 \times 10^{15}\text{ s})^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ a_c = \frac{4(9.87)(2.84 \times 10^{20})}{6.74 \times 10^{31}} = \frac{1.12 \times 10^{22}}{6.74 \times 10^{31}} = 1.66 \times 10^{-10}\text{ m/s}^2 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{a_c}{g} = \frac{1.66 \times 10^{-10}}{9.80} = 1.69 \times 10^{-11} $$
</div>

The centripetal acceleration is about $$ 1.7 \times 10^{-11} g $$, which is incredibly small - about 17 billionths of g. This strongly supports the use of the Sun as a nearly inertial reference frame.

**(b) Average orbital speed:**

<div class="equation">

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{1.78 \times 10^{21}}{8.21 \times 10^{15}} = 2.17 \times 10^{5}\text{ m/s} = 217\text{ km/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at an impressive speed of 217 km/s (about 780,000 km/h or 485,000 mph)! Despite this tremendous speed, the centripetal acceleration is incredibly small ($$ 1.66 \times 10^{-10}\text{ m/s}^2 $$) because the orbital radius is so enormous. This tiny acceleration - about 17 billionths of the acceleration due to gravity on Earth - confirms that the Sun can be treated as an excellent inertial reference frame for almost all practical purposes.

The Sun's orbital speed might seem surprisingly high, but consider that at this speed, it still takes 260 million years to complete one orbit around the galaxy. The Sun has completed only about 18 orbits since the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago. This motion carries the entire solar system with it - all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets move together at 217 km/s through the galaxy.

**Answer**

(a) The centripetal acceleration of the Sun is $$ 1.66 \times 10^{-10}\text{ m/s}^2 $$. This is about $$ 1.7 \times 10^{-11} g $$, which strongly supports using the Sun as a nearly inertial reference frame.

(b) The average speed of the Sun in its galactic orbit is $$ 2.17 \times 10^{5}\text{ m/s} = 217\text{ km/s} $$. This is surprisingly fast - about 0.07% of the speed of light!

**Unreasonable Result**

A mountain 10.0 km from a person exerts a gravitational force on him equal to
2.00% of his weight.

(a) Calculate the mass of the mountain.

(b) Compare the mountain’s mass with that of Earth.

(c) What is unreasonable about these results?

(d) Which premises are unreasonable or inconsistent? (Note that accurate
gravitational measurements can easily detect the effect of nearby mountains and
variations in local geology.)

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) We'll use Newton's law of universal gravitation $$ F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$ where the force is 2.00% of the person's weight. We'll solve for the mountain's mass.
(b) We'll compare the calculated mass to Earth's mass.
(c) and (d) We'll evaluate whether the results and premises are reasonable.

**Solution**

(a) The gravitational force from the mountain is given as 2.00% of the person's weight:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{mountain}} = 0.0200mg $$
</div>

Using Newton's law of universal gravitation:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{mountain}} = G\frac{m M_{\text{mountain}}}{r^2} $$
</div>

Setting these equal and solving for $$ M_{\text{mountain}} $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ 0.0200mg = G\frac{m M_{\text{mountain}}}{r^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ M_{\text{mountain}} = \frac{0.0200 g r^2}{G} $$
</div>

Substitute values with $$ r = 10.0 $$ km $$ = 1.00 \times 10^4 $$ m:

<div class="equation">
$$ M_{\text{mountain}} = \frac{0.0200 (9.80\text{ m/s}^2)(1.00 \times 10^4\text{ m})^2}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}\text{ N·m}^2\text{/kg}^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ M_{\text{mountain}} = \frac{0.0200 (9.80)(1.00 \times 10^8)}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.96 \times 10^7}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}} = 2.94 \times 10^{17}\text{ kg} $$
</div>

(b) Compare to Earth's mass ($$ M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \times 10^{24} $$ kg):

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{M_{\text{mountain}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{2.94 \times 10^{17}\text{ kg}}{5.972 \times 10^{24}\text{ kg}} = 4.92 \times 10^{-8} $$
</div>

The mountain would be $$ 4.92 \times 10^{-8} $$ (about 0.00000492%) of Earth's mass.

(c) **What is unreasonable:**

The calculated mass of $$ 2.94 \times 10^{17} $$ kg is absurdly large for a mountain. For comparison, Mount Everest has a mass of approximately $$ 8.1 \times 10^{14} $$ kg - about 360 times less than our calculated value. The fraction of Earth's mass ($$4.92 \times 10^{-8}$$) may seem small, but it's still unreasonably large for a single mountain.

(d) **Which premises are unreasonable:**

The unreasonable premise is that the mountain exerts a gravitational force equal to 2.00% of a person's weight. This is far too large. In reality, even massive mountains exert gravitational forces that are typically less than 0.001% of a person's weight at distances of 10 km. The force would need to be about 1000 times smaller to be realistic. While sensitive gravitational measurements can detect the effect of nearby mountains (which is how geologists map underground structures), these effects are much more subtle than the problem suggests.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the importance of checking whether calculated results match physical reality. The enormous mass required for a mountain to exert 2.00% of a person's weight demonstrates that gravitational forces between everyday objects are extremely weak. Only objects with planetary masses create gravitational forces strong enough to dominate our daily experience. This is why we don't notice the gravitational attraction between people, buildings, or even mountains—these forces are millions of times weaker than Earth's gravitational pull.

gravitational constant, *G*
: a proportionality factor used in the equation for Newton’s universal law of
gravitation; it is a universal constant—that is, it is thought to be the same
everywhere in the universe

center of mass
: the point where the entire mass of an object can be thought to be concentrated

microgravity
: an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small
compared with that produced by Earth at its surface

Newton’s universal law of gravitation
: every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force
along a line joining them; the force is directly proportional to the product of
their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them
