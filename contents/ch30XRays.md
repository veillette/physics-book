Each type of atom (or element) has its own characteristic electromagnetic
spectrum. **X-rays**{: class="term"} lie at the high-frequency end of an atom’s
spectrum and are characteristic of the atom as well. In this section, we explore
characteristic X-rays and some of their important applications.

We have previously discussed X-rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum
in [Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum](../contents/ch29PhotonEnergiesAndTheElectromagneticSpectrum). That module
illustrated how an x-ray tube (a specialized CRT) produces X-rays. Electrons
emitted from a hot filament are accelerated with a high voltage, gaining
significant kinetic energy and striking the anode.

There are two processes by which X-rays are produced in the anode of an x-ray
tube. In one process, the deceleration of electrons produces X-rays, and these x
rays are called _bremsstrahlung_, or braking radiation. The second process is
atomic in nature and produces _characteristic X-rays_, so called because they
are characteristic of the anode material. The x-ray spectrum
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) is typical of what is produced by an x-ray tube,
showing a broad curve of bremsstrahlung radiation with characteristic x-ray
peaks on it.

![A graph of X-ray intensity versus frequency is shown. The curve starts from a point near the origin in the first quadrant and increases. Before the frequency attains its maximum value, two sharp peaks are formed, after which the X-ray intensity decreases sharply to zero at f max. Below the graph appears the equation q V equals h f max.](../resources/Figure_30_04_01.jpg 'X-ray spectrum obtained when energetic electrons strike a material, such as in the anode of a CRT. The smooth part of the spectrum is bremsstrahlung radiation, while the peaks are characteristic of the anode material. A different anode material would have characteristic x-ray peaks at different frequencies. ')
{: #Figure1}

The spectrum in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) is collected over a period of time in
which many electrons strike the anode, with a variety of possible outcomes for
each hit. The broad range of x-ray energies in the bremsstrahlung radiation
indicates that an incident electron’s energy is not usually converted entirely
into photon energy. The highest-energy X-ray produced is one for which all of
the electron’s energy was converted to photon energy. Thus the accelerating
voltage and the maximum x-ray energy are related by conservation of energy.
Electric potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and then to photon
energy, so that $${E}_{\text{max} }={ hf}_{\text{max} }={q}_{e}V\text{.} $$ Units
of electron volts are convenient. For example, a 100-kV accelerating voltage
produces x-ray photons with a maximum energy of 100 keV.

Some electrons excite atoms in the anode. Part of the energy that they deposit
by collision with an atom results in one or more of the atom’s inner electrons
being knocked into a higher orbit or the atom being ionized. When the anode’s
atoms de-excite, they emit characteristic electromagnetic radiation. The most
energetic of these are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled—that is,
when an $$n=1 $$ or $$n=2 $$ shell electron has been excited to a higher level,
and another electron falls into the vacant spot. A *characteristic X-ray* (
see [Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum](../contents/ch29PhotonEnergiesAndTheElectromagneticSpectrum)) is
electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by an atom when an inner-shell vacancy is
filled. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a representative energy-level diagram that
illustrates the labeling of characteristic X-rays. X-rays created when an
electron falls into an $$n=1 $$ shell vacancy are called $${K}_{\alpha } $$ when
they come from the next higher level; that is, an $$n=2 $$ to $$n=1 $$
transition. The labels $$\mathrm{K, L, M,...} $$ come from the older
alphabetical labeling of shells starting with $$K $$ rather than using the
principal quantum numbers 1, 2, 3, …. A more energetic $${K}_{\beta } $$ X-ray
is produced when an electron falls into an $$n=1 $$ shell vacancy from the $$n=3
$$ shell; that is, an $$n=3 $$ to $$n=1 $$ transition. Similarly, when an
electron falls into the $$n=2 $$ shell from the $$n=3 $$ shell, an $${L}_{\alpha
} $$ X-ray is created. The energies of these X-rays depend on the energies of
electron states in the particular atom and, thus, are characteristic of that
element: every element has its own set of x-ray energies. This property can be
used to identify elements, for example, to find trace (small) amounts of an
element in an environmental or biological sample.

![Different energy levels are shown in the form of horizontal lines. The line at the bottom shows the energy level for n is equal to one for the K shell. At a distance above this line, another horizontal line shows the energy level for n is equal to two for the shell L. Similarly, other lines are shown for the shells M and N. As we move from bottom to the top, the distance between the lines decreases, and near the end a few lines are shown very close to each other. Each level is labeled according to the characteristic X-ray of the shell.](../resources/Figure_30_04_02.jpg 'A characteristic X-ray is emitted when an electron fills an inner-shell vacancy, as shown for several transitions in this approximate energy level diagram for a multiple-electron atom.

Characteristic X-Ray Energy
</div>
Calculate the approximate energy of a  $${K}_{\alpha } $$
 X-ray from a tungsten anode in an x-ray tube.

**Strategy**

How do we calculate energies in a multiple-electron atom? In the case of
characteristic X-rays, the following approximate calculation is reasonable.
Characteristic X-rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled.
Inner-shell electrons are nearer the nucleus than others in an atom and thus
feel little net effect from the others. This is similar to what happens inside a
charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so
that it produces no electric field inside. It is reasonable to assume the
inner-shell electrons have hydrogen-like energies, as given by $${E}_{n}=-\frac{
{Z}^{2} }{ {n}^{2} }{E}_{0} $$ $$\left(n=1, 2, 3, ...\right) $$ . As noted, a
$${K}\_{\alpha } $$ X-ray is produced by an $$n=2 $$
** to $$n=1 $$
** transition. Since there are two electrons in a filled $$K $$ \*_ shell, a vacancy would leave one electron, so that the effective charge would
be $$Z-1 $$ rather than $$Z $$
_.\* For tungsten, $$Z=74 $$ , so that the effective charge is 73.

**Solution**

$${E}_{n}=-\frac{ {Z}^{2} }{ {n}^{2} }{E}_{0} $$ $$\left(n=1, 2, 3, ...\right) $$
gives the orbital energies for hydrogen-like atoms to be $${E}_{n}=-\left(
{Z}^{2}/{n}^{2}\right){E}_{0} $$ , where $${E}_{0}=13.6 \text{eV} $$ . As noted,
the effective $$Z $$ is 73. Now the $${K}_{\alpha } $$ x-ray energy is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{ {K}_{\alpha } }=\Delta E={E}_{\text{i} }-{E}_{\text{f} }={E}_{2}-{E}_{1}, $$
</div>
where

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{1}=-\frac{ {Z}^{2} }{ {1}^{2} }{E}_{0}=-\frac{ {73}^{2} }{1}\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)=-72.5 \text{keV} $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{2}=-\frac{ {Z}^{2} }{ {2}^{2}}{E}_{0}=-\frac{ {73}^{2}}{4}\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)=-18.1 \text{keV} \text{.}  $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{ {K}_{\alpha }}=-18.1\text{ keV}-\left(-72.5 \text{keV}\right)=54.4 keV. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This large photon energy is typical of characteristic X-rays from heavy
elements. It is large compared with other atomic emissions because it is
produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled, and inner-shell electrons are
tightly bound. Characteristic X-ray energies become progressively larger for
heavier elements because their energy increases approximately as $${Z}^{2} $$ .
Significant accelerating voltage is needed to create these inner-shell
vacancies. In the case of tungsten, at least 72.5 kV is needed, because other
shells are filled and you cannot simply bump one electron to a higher filled
shell. Tungsten is a common anode material in x-ray tubes; so much of the energy
of the impinging electrons is absorbed, raising its temperature, that a
high-melting-point material like tungsten is required.

### Medical and Other Diagnostic Uses of X-rays

All of us can identify diagnostic uses of x-ray photons. Among these are the
universal dental and medical X-rays that have become an essential part of
medical diagnostics. (See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) and [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) X
rays are also used to inspect our luggage at airports, as shown
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), and for early detection of cracks in crucial aircraft
components. An X-ray is not only a noun meaning high-energy photon, it also is
an image produced by X-rays, and it has been made into a familiar verb—to be
x-rayed.

![The X-ray image of front view of the jaw, especially the teeth.](../resources/Figure_30_04_04.jpg 'An x-ray image reveals fillings in a person’s teeth. (credit: Dmitry G, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure3}

![An X-ray image of a person’s chest is shown, clearly showing a pacemaker in the left side.](../resources/Figure_30_04_05.jpg 'This x-ray image of a person’s chest shows many details, including an artificial pacemaker. (credit: Sunzi99, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure4}

![A colored X-ray image of a piece of luggage.](../resources/Figure_30_04_03.jpg 'This x-ray image shows the contents of a piece of luggage. The denser the material, the darker the shadow. (credit: IDuke, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure5}

The most common x-ray images are simple shadows. Since x-ray photons have high
energies, they penetrate materials that are opaque to visible light. The more
energy an x-ray photon has, the more material it will penetrate. So an x-ray
tube may be operated at 50.0 kV for a chest X-ray, whereas it may need to be
operated at 100 kV to examine a broken leg in a cast. The depth of penetration
is related to the density of the material as well as to the energy of the
photon. The denser the material, the fewer x-ray photons get through and the
darker the shadow. Thus X-rays excel at detecting breaks in bones and in imaging
other physiological structures, such as some tumors, that differ in density from
surrounding material. Because of their high photon energy, X-rays produce
significant ionization in materials and damage cells in biological organisms.
Modern uses minimize exposure to the patient and eliminate exposure to others.
Biological effects of X-rays will be explored in the next chapter along with
other types of ionizing radiation such as those produced by nuclei.

As the x-ray energy increases, the Compton effect (
see [Photon Momentum](../contents/ch29PhotonMomentum)) becomes more important in the attenuation of the
X-rays. Here, the X-ray scatters from an outer electron shell of the atom,
giving the ejected electron some kinetic energy while losing energy itself. The
probability for attenuation of the X-rays depends upon the number of electrons
present (the material’s density) as well as the thickness of the material.
Chemical composition of the medium, as characterized by its atomic number $$Z $$
, is not important here. Low-energy X-rays provide better contrast (sharper
images). However, due to greater attenuation and less scattering, they are more
absorbed by thicker materials. Greater contrast can be achieved by injecting a
substance with a large atomic number, such as barium or iodine. The structure of
the part of the body that contains the substance (e.g., the gastro-intestinal
tract or the abdomen) can easily be seen this way.

Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early
detection can be very effective, hence the importance of x-ray diagnostics. A
mammogram cannot diagnose a malignant tumor, only give evidence of a lump or
region of increased density within the breast. X-ray absorption by different
types of soft tissue is very similar, so contrast is difficult; this is
especially true for younger women, who typically have denser breasts. For older
women who are at greater risk of developing breast cancer, the presence of more
fat in the breast gives the lump or tumor more contrast. MRI (Magnetic resonance
imaging) has recently been used as a supplement to conventional X-rays to
improve detection and eliminate false positives. The subject’s radiation dose
from X-rays will be treated in a later chapter.

A standard X-ray gives only a two-dimensional view of the object. Dense bones
might hide images of soft tissue or organs. If you took another X-ray from the
side of the person (the first one being from the front), you would gain
additional information. While shadow images are sufficient in many applications,
far more sophisticated images can be produced with modern
technology. [[Figure 6]](#Figure6) shows the use of a computed tomography (CT)
scanner, also called computed axial tomography (CAT) scanner. X-rays are passed
through a narrow section (called a slice) of the patient’s body (or body part)
over a range of directions. An array of many detectors on the other side of the
patient registers the X-rays. The system is then rotated around the patient and
another image is taken, and so on. The x-ray tube and detector array are
mechanically attached and so rotate together. Complex computer image processing
of the relative absorption of the X-rays along different directions produces a
highly-detailed image. Different slices are taken as the patient moves through
the scanner on a table. Multiple images of different slices can also be computer
analyzed to produce three-dimensional information, sometimes enhancing specific
types of tissue, as shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). G. Hounsfield (UK) and A.
Cormack (US) won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979 for their development of
computed tomography.

### X-Ray Diffraction and Crystallography

Since x-ray photons are very energetic, they have relatively short wavelengths.
For example, the 54.4-keV $${K}_{\alpha } $$ X-ray of [[Example 1]](#Example1)
has a wavelength $$\lambda =hc/E=0.0228 \text{nm} $$ . Thus, typical x-ray
photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects, like teeth, and
produce sharp shadows; however, since atoms are on the order of 0.1 nm in size,
X-rays can be used to detect the location, shape, and size of atoms and
molecules. The process is called **x-ray diffraction**, because it involves the
diffraction and interference of X-rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed
for information about the structures that scattered the X-rays. Perhaps the most
famous example of x-ray diffraction is the discovery of the double-helix
structure of DNA in 1953 by an international team of scientists working at the
Cavendish Laboratory—American James Watson, Englishman Francis Crick, and New
Zealand–born Maurice Wilkins. Using x-ray diffraction data produced by Rosalind
Franklin, they were the first to discern the structure of DNA that is so crucial
to life. For this, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine. There is much debate and controversy over the issue
that Rosalind Franklin was not included in the prize.

[[Figure 8]](#Figure8) shows a diffraction pattern produced by the scattering of
X-rays from a crystal. This process is known as x-ray crystallography because of
the information it can yield about crystal structure, and it was the type of
data Rosalind Franklin supplied to Watson and Crick for DNA. Not only do X-rays
confirm the size and shape of atoms, they give information on the atomic
arrangements in materials. For example, current research in high-temperature
superconductors involves complex materials whose lattice arrangements are
crucial to obtaining a superconducting material. These can be studied using
x-ray crystallography.

This white disk is the shadow of the beam block, which blocks the part of the incident X-ray beam that was not diffracted by the crystal.](../resources/Figure_30_04_08.jpg 'X-ray diffraction from the crystal of a protein, hen egg lysozyme, produced this interference pattern. Analysis of the pattern yields information about the structure of the protein. (credit: Del45, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure8}

Historically, the scattering of X-rays from crystals was used to prove that x
rays are energetic EM waves. This was suspected from the time of the discovery
of X-rays in 1895, but it was not until 1912 that the German Max von Laue (
1879–1960) convinced two of his colleagues to scatter X-rays from crystals. If a
diffraction pattern is obtained, he reasoned, then the X-rays must be waves, and
their wavelength could be determined. (The spacing of atoms in various crystals
was reasonably well known at the time, based on good values for Avogadro’s
number.) The experiments were convincing, and the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics
was given to von Laue for his suggestion leading to the proof that X-rays are EM
waves. In 1915, the unique father-and-son team of Sir William Henry Bragg and
his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg were awarded a joint Nobel Prize for
inventing the x-ray spectrometer and the then-new science of x-ray analysis. The
elder Bragg had migrated to Australia from England just after graduating in
mathematics. He learned physics and chemistry during his career at the
University of Adelaide. The younger Bragg was born in Adelaide but went back to
the Cavendish Laboratories in England to a career in x-ray and neutron
crystallography; he provided support for Watson, Crick, and Wilkins for their
work on unraveling the mysteries of DNA and to Max Perutz for his 1962 Nobel
Prize-winning work on the structure of hemoglobin. Here again, we witness the
enabling nature of physics—establishing instruments and designing experiments as
well as solving mysteries in the biomedical sciences.

Certain other uses for X-rays will be studied in later chapters. X-rays are
useful in the treatment of cancer because of the inhibiting effect they have on
cell reproduction. X-rays observed coming from outer space are useful in
determining the nature of their sources, such as neutron stars and possibly
black holes. Created in nuclear bomb explosions, X-rays can also be used to
detect clandestine atmospheric tests of these weapons. X-rays can cause
excitations of atoms, which then fluoresce (emitting characteristic EM
radiation), making x-ray-induced fluorescence a valuable analytical tool in a
range of fields from art to archaeology.

### Section Summary

- X-rays are relatively high-frequency EM radiation. They are produced by
  transitions between inner-shell electron levels, which produce X-rays
  characteristic of the atomic element, or by decelerating electrons.
- X-rays have many uses, including medical diagnostics and x-ray diffraction.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the shortest-wavelength x-ray radiation that can be generated in an x-ray tube with an applied voltage of 50.0 kV? (b) Calculate the photon energy in eV. (c) Explain the relationship of the photon energy to the applied voltage.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The shortest-wavelength X-ray is produced when all of an electron's kinetic energy is converted into a single photon. When an electron is accelerated through a potential difference $$ V $$ , it gains kinetic energy $$ KE = eV $$ . The maximum photon energy is $$ E_{\text{max}} = hf_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} $$ . Setting $$ eV = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} $$ and solving for $$ \lambda_{\text{min}} $$ , we can use the convenient relationship $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ .

(b) The maximum photon energy equals the kinetic energy gained by the electron.

(c) We'll examine the relationship between the accelerating voltage and the photon energy.

**Solution**

(a) The maximum photon energy equals the electron's kinetic energy:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{max}} = eV = 50.0 \text{ keV} = 50,000 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Using $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$ and $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ :
<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{max}}} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{50,000 \text{ eV}} = 0.0248 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = 0.0248 \text{ nm} = 0.248 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} = 2.48 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m} $$
</div>

(b) The maximum photon energy is:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{max}} = 50.0 \text{ keV} = 50,000 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

(c) The relationship between photon energy and applied voltage is direct and simple:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{photon}} (\text{in eV}) = e \times V (\text{in volts}) $$
</div>

Since the elementary charge $$ e = 1 $$ electron charge, the numerical value of the energy in electron volts equals the numerical value of the voltage in volts. For example, 50.0 kV produces photons with a maximum energy of 50.0 keV. This makes electron volts a particularly convenient unit for X-ray work.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the production of bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) X-rays. When high-speed electrons strike the anode of an X-ray tube, they decelerate rapidly, and some convert all their kinetic energy into a single photon. The wavelength of 0.0248 nm is about 20,000 times shorter than visible light (which has wavelengths of 400-700 nm), placing it well into the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The direct relationship between accelerating voltage and maximum photon energy ( $$ E = eV $$ ) is one of the most straightforward examples of energy conversion in physics. It reflects conservation of energy: electrical potential energy is converted to kinetic energy of the electron, which is then converted to photon energy. This relationship has important practical implications: (1) To produce higher-energy (more penetrating) X-rays, simply increase the tube voltage; (2) The voltage sets a sharp upper limit on photon energy—no X-ray can have more energy than $$ eV $$ ; (3) Most X-rays produced have lower energies because electrons typically don't convert all their energy to a single photon.

In actual X-ray spectra, the continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum shows all energies from near zero up to this maximum, with characteristic X-ray peaks superimposed. The 50 kV accelerating voltage used here is typical for medical chest X-rays, providing enough penetration to image through soft tissue while still being absorbed differently by bones. Higher voltages (100-150 kV) are used for thicker body parts or to examine denser materials.

A color television tube also generates some X-rays when its electron beam strikes the screen. What is the shortest wavelength of these X-rays, if a 30.0-kV potential is used to accelerate the electrons? (Note that TVs have shielding to prevent these X-rays from exposing viewers.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The shortest-wavelength X-ray is produced when all of the electron's kinetic energy is converted into a single photon. The electron gains kinetic energy equal to $$ KE = q_e V $$ when accelerated through a potential difference $$ V $$ . This energy equals the maximum photon energy: $$ E_{\text{max}} = hf_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} $$ . We can use the convenient relationship $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ to find the wavelength.

**Solution**

The maximum photon energy equals the kinetic energy gained by the electron:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{max}} = q_e V = 30.0 \text{ keV} = 30,000 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Using $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$ and $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{max}}} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{30,000 \text{ eV}} = 0.0413 \text{ nm} = 4.13 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m} $$
</div>

The shortest wavelength is **0.0413 nm** or **4.13 × 10⁻¹¹ m**.

**Discussion**

This wavelength is characteristic of the bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) X-rays produced when electrons are rapidly decelerated upon striking the screen material. The 30 kV accelerating voltage in old CRT televisions was sufficient to produce X-rays, which is why TV manufacturers included lead shielding in the glass screen and around the tube. The X-ray energy of 30 keV is relatively low compared to medical X-rays (which typically use 50-150 kV), but prolonged exposure could still pose a health risk, hence the shielding requirements. Modern flat-panel displays (LCD, LED, OLED) do not produce X-rays because they don't use high-voltage electron beams. The inverse relationship between accelerating voltage and minimum wavelength ( $$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{eV} $$ ) is fundamental to X-ray production: higher voltages produce shorter wavelengths (more penetrating X-rays). This wavelength of 0.0413 nm is about 1000 times shorter than visible light wavelengths (400-700 nm), placing it firmly in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The fact that we can calculate this precisely from just the accelerating voltage demonstrates the direct connection between electrical energy and photon energy in quantum mechanics.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The most energetic X-ray photon is produced when an electron converts all its kinetic energy (gained from the applied voltage) into a single photon. The energy in eV equals the accelerating voltage, and we can convert to joules using $$ 1 \text{ eV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} $$ .

(b) We'll use the relationship $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$ to find the wavelength, using either $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ or SI units with $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$ and $$ c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) The maximum photon energy equals the electron's kinetic energy after being accelerated through 100 kV:
<div class="equation">

$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{100 \times 10^3 \text{ eV}} = \frac{1240}{100,000} \text{ nm} = 0.0124 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = 0.0124 \text{ nm} = 1.24 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m} = 0.124 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$
</div>

The wavelength is **0.0124 nm** or **1.24 × 10⁻¹¹ m**.

**Discussion**

The 100 kV accelerating voltage is typical for medical diagnostic X-rays, particularly for imaging denser body parts (like examining a broken leg in a cast, as mentioned in the chapter) or for industrial radiography. The resulting X-rays with wavelength 0.0124 nm are quite penetrating—about half the wavelength of the 50 kV X-rays calculated in the previous problem, which makes them more energetic and able to penetrate through denser materials.

To put this wavelength in perspective: it's about 40,000 times shorter than visible light, about 10 times smaller than the size of a typical atom (0.1 nm), and comparable to the spacing between atoms in a crystal. This last fact is crucial for X-ray crystallography—X-rays with wavelengths comparable to atomic spacings can be diffracted by crystals, revealing atomic arrangements.

The energy of 100 keV (or $$ 1.60 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J} $$ ) might seem tiny in everyday terms, but it's enormous on the atomic scale. This is about 7 million times the ionization energy of hydrogen (13.6 eV). Such energetic photons can easily ionize atoms by knocking out inner-shell electrons, which is why X-rays are classified as ionizing radiation and why they can damage biological tissue. The biological effects of X-rays depend on both the dose (total energy deposited) and the photon energy—higher energy photons penetrate deeper but are less likely to be absorbed per unit thickness. Modern medical imaging carefully balances the need for good image quality (requiring sufficient X-ray penetration and dose) against minimizing radiation exposure to the patient. This optimization has led to dramatic reductions in medical radiation doses while improving image quality through better detectors and image processing.

The maximum characteristic x-ray photon energy comes from the capture of a free electron into a  $$K $$
 shell vacancy. What is this photon energy in keV for tungsten, assuming the free electron has no initial kinetic energy?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When a free electron (with zero initial kinetic energy) is captured into a K shell vacancy, it transitions from essentially $$ n = \infty $$ (unbound state with $$ E = 0 $$ ) to $$ n = 1 $$ (K shell). The energy of the emitted photon equals the magnitude of the K shell binding energy. For hydrogen-like atoms, the K shell energy is $$ E_1 = -\frac{Z^2}{1^2} E_0 $$ , where $$ E_0 = 13.6 \text{ eV} $$ . However, for inner-shell electrons in heavy atoms, we must account for screening by using an effective charge $$ Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - 1 $$ because one electron remains in the K shell. For tungsten, $$ Z = 74 $$ .

**Solution**

For tungsten with $$ Z = 74 $$ , the effective nuclear charge for a K-shell electron is approximately $$ Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - 1 = 73 $$ (accounting for the other K-shell electron's screening).

The K-shell binding energy is:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_K = -\frac{Z_{\text{eff}}^2}{n^2} E_0 = -\frac{(73)^2}{1^2} (13.6 \text{ eV}) = -(5329)(13.6 \text{ eV}) = -72,474 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Converting to keV:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_K = -72.5 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

When a free electron (at $$ E = 0 $$ ) is captured into this K-shell state, the energy of the emitted photon is:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = 0 - (-72.5 \text{ keV}) = 72.5 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

The maximum characteristic X-ray photon energy for tungsten is **72.5 keV**.

**Discussion**

This energy represents the absolute maximum characteristic X-ray that tungsten can emit—it occurs when a completely free electron (from outside the atom) falls directly into a K-shell vacancy. This is slightly higher than the $$ K_\alpha $$ X-ray energy of 54.4 keV calculated in Example 1 of this chapter, which corresponds to an $$ n = 2 $$ to $$ n = 1 $$ transition (an electron from the L shell filling a K shell vacancy). The difference of about 18 keV represents the binding energy of the L shell. This 72.5 keV result matches the K-edge absorption energy for tungsten—the minimum photon energy needed to knock a K-shell electron completely out of the atom. The high energy of this X-ray (72.5 keV) explains why tungsten is used as the anode material in X-ray tubes: it can produce very penetrating X-rays suitable for medical imaging. The calculation also explains why an X-ray tube operating at less than 72.5 kV cannot produce K-shell characteristic X-rays from tungsten—the accelerating voltage must be at least this high to create K-shell vacancies in the first place. The $$ Z^2 $$ dependence of the binding energy (and thus the characteristic X-ray energy) means that heavier elements produce much more energetic characteristic X-rays: for example, lead ( $$ Z = 82 $$ ) produces K-shell X-rays near 88 keV, while copper ( $$ Z = 29 $$ ) produces them near 9 keV.

What are the approximate energies of the  $${K}_{\alpha } $$
 and  $${K}_{\beta } $$
 X-rays for copper?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Characteristic X-rays are produced when inner-shell vacancies are filled. A $$ K_\alpha $$ X-ray results from an $$ n = 2 $$ to $$ n = 1 $$ transition (L to K shell), while a $$ K_\beta $$ X-ray comes from an $$ n = 3 $$ to $$ n = 1 $$ transition (M to K shell). We can use the hydrogen-like atom approximation with an effective nuclear charge $$ Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - 1 $$ to account for the screening by the remaining K-shell electron. For copper, $$ Z = 29 $$ . The energy levels are $$ E_n = -\frac{Z_{\text{eff}}^2}{n^2} E_0 $$ where $$ E_0 = 13.6 \text{ eV} $$ , and the photon energy is $$ E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} $$ .

**Solution**

For copper with $$ Z = 29 $$ , the effective nuclear charge experienced by a K-shell electron is approximately:
<div class="equation">
$$ Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - 1 = 29 - 1 = 28 $$
</div>

The energy levels are:
<div class="equation">
$$ E_n = -\frac{Z_{\text{eff}}^2}{n^2} E_0 = -\frac{(28)^2}{n^2} (13.6 \text{ eV}) = -\frac{784}{n^2} (13.6 \text{ eV}) $$
</div>

For $$ n = 1 $$ (K shell):
<div class="equation">
$$ E_1 = -\frac{784}{1} (13.6 \text{ eV}) = -10,662 \text{ eV} = -10.7 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

For $$ n = 2 $$ (L shell):
<div class="equation">
$$ E_2 = -\frac{784}{4} (13.6 \text{ eV}) = -2,666 \text{ eV} = -2.67 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

For $$ n = 3 $$ (M shell):
<div class="equation">
$$ E_3 = -\frac{784}{9} (13.6 \text{ eV}) = -1,185 \text{ eV} = -1.19 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

**For K-alpha ( $$ n = 2 \to n = 1 $$ ):**
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{K_\alpha} = E_2 - E_1 = (-2.67) - (-10.7) = 8.03 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

**For K-beta ( $$ n = 3 \to n = 1 $$ ):**
<div class="equation">
$$ E_{K_\beta} = E_3 - E_1 = (-1.19) - (-10.7) = 9.51 \text{ keV} $$
</div>

Rounding to three significant figures:
- **K-alpha: 8.00 keV**
- **K-beta: 9.48 keV**

**Discussion**

These calculated values for copper's characteristic X-rays are quite close to the measured values ( $$ K_\alpha = 8.05 \text{ keV} $$ and $$ K_\beta = 8.91 \text{ keV} $$ experimentally). The slight discrepancy comes from our simplified model using $$ Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - 1 $$ , which doesn't account for the different screening experienced by electrons in different shells. More sophisticated calculations would use different effective charges for each shell.

Copper is commonly used as an anode material in X-ray diffraction studies because its $$ K_\alpha $$ X-rays (8.05 keV, wavelength 0.154 nm) have a wavelength well-suited for studying crystal structures. The wavelength is comparable to interatomic spacings in crystals, making copper K-alpha radiation ideal for X-ray crystallography. The characteristic X-ray energy depends approximately on $$ Z^2 $$ (since $$ E \propto Z_{\text{eff}}^2 $$ ), so heavier elements produce much more energetic characteristic X-rays. For comparison:
- Aluminum ( $$ Z = 13 $$ ): $$ K_\alpha \approx 1.5 \text{ keV} $$
- Copper ( $$ Z = 29 $$ ): $$ K_\alpha \approx 8.0 \text{ keV} $$
- Molybdenum ( $$ Z = 42 $$ ): $$ K_\alpha \approx 17.5 \text{ keV} $$
- Tungsten ( $$ Z = 74 $$ ): $$ K_\alpha \approx 59 \text{ keV} $$

The $$ K_\beta $$ X-ray is always more energetic than the $$ K_\alpha $$ because the electron falls from a higher shell (M vs L), releasing more energy. However, $$ K_\alpha $$ X-rays are typically more intense than $$ K_\beta $$ X-rays because transitions from the L shell are more probable than from the M shell. In X-ray spectroscopy and crystallography, filters or monochromators are often used to select predominantly the $$ K_\alpha $$ radiation, which provides sharper, more well-defined wavelengths for precision measurements.
