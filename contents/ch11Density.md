Which weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks? This old riddle plays
with the distinction between mass and density. A ton is a ton, of course; but
bricks have much greater density than feathers, and so we are tempted to think
of them as heavier. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

**Density**, as you will see, is an important characteristic of substances. It
is crucial, for example, in determining whether an object sinks or floats in a
fluid. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance or object. In equation
form, density is defined as

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}, $$
</div>

where the Greek letter $$\rho $$
(rho) is the symbol for density, $$m $$ is the mass, and $$V $$ is the volume
occupied by the substance.

Density
</div>
Density is mass per unit volume.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}, $$
</div>
where  $$\rho  $$
 is the symbol for density,  $$m $$  is the mass, and  $$V $$
 is the volume occupied by the substance.

</div>

In the riddle regarding the feathers and bricks, the masses are the same, but
the volume occupied by the feathers is much greater, since their density is much
lower. The SI unit of density is $${\text{kg/m} }^{3} $$ , representative values
are given in [[Table 1]](#Table1). The metric system was originally devised
so that water would have a density of $$1 {\text{g/cm} }^{3} $$ , equivalent to
$$10^{3} {\text{kg/m} }^{3} $$ . Thus the basic mass unit, the kilogram, was
first devised to be the mass of 1000 mL of water, which has a volume of 1000
cm<sup>3</sup>.

As you can see by examining [[Table 1]](#Table1), the density of an object
may help identify its composition. The density of gold, for example, is about
2.5 times the density of iron, which is about 2.5 times the density of aluminum.
Density also reveals something about the phase of the matter and its
substructure. Notice that the densities of liquids and solids are roughly
comparable, consistent with the fact that their atoms are in close contact. The
densities of gases are much less than those of liquids and solids, because the
atoms in gases are separated by large amounts of empty space.

<div class="title">
Calculating the Mass of a Reservoir From Its Volume
</div>
A reservoir has a surface area of  $$ 50.0 {\text{km}}^{2} $$
 and an average depth of 40.0 m. What mass of water is held behind the dam? (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) for a view of a large reservoir—the Three Gorges Dam site on the Yangtze River in central China.)

<strong>Strategy </strong>

We can calculate the volume $$V $$ of the reservoir from its dimensions, and
find the density of water $$\rho $$ in [[Table 1]](#Table1). Then the mass
$$m $$ can be found from the definition of density

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}. $$
</div>
**Solution**

Solving equation $$\rho =m/V $$ for $$m $$ gives $$m=\rho V $$.

The volume $$V $$ of the reservoir is its surface area $$A $$ times its average
depth $$h $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}V& =& Ah=\left(50.0 {\text{km}}^{2}\right)\left(40.0 \text{m}\right)\\ & =& \left[ \left(50.0 \text{k}{\text{m}}^{2}\right){\left(\frac{ 10^{3} \text{m}}{1 \text{km}}\right)}^{2}\right]  \left(40.0 \text{m}\right)= 2.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{m}}^{3}\end{array} $$
</div>
The density of water  $$\rho  $$
 from [[Table 1]](#Table1) is  $$ 1.000 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ .
 Substituting  $$V $$
 and  $$\rho  $$  into the expression for mass gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}m& =& \left( 1.00 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 2.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{m}}^{3}\right)\\ & =&  2.00 \times 10^{12}  \text{kg} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A large reservoir contains a very large mass of water. In this example, the
weight of the water in the reservoir is $$mg= 1.96 \times 10^{13} \text{N} $$ ,
where $$g $$ is the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity (about $$ 9.80
{\text{m/s}}^{2} $$ ). It is reasonable to ask whether the dam must supply a
force equal to this tremendous weight. The answer is no. As we shall see in the
following sections, the force the dam must supply can be much smaller than the
weight of the water it holds back.

  form, density is defined as

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}. $$
  </div>

- The SI unit of density is $${\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ .

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Approximately how does the density of air vary with altitude?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
We need to consider how atmospheric pressure and temperature change with altitude, and how these affect air density through the ideal gas law.

**Solution:**
**The density of air decreases approximately exponentially with increasing altitude.**

This occurs because:
1. Air pressure decreases with altitude as there is less atmosphere above to exert weight
2. The ideal gas law relates density to pressure: $$ \rho = \frac{PM}{RT} $$ where $$ P $$ is pressure, $$ M $$ is molar mass, $$ R $$ is the gas constant, and $$ T $$ is temperature
3. As pressure drops with altitude, density proportionally decreases

Approximate values:
- Sea level: $$ \rho \approx 1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
- 5,500 m (18,000 ft): $$ \rho \approx 0.65 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$ (about half)
- 8,850 m (Mt. Everest): $$ \rho \approx 0.43 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$ (about one-third)

**Discussion:**
This exponential decrease has significant practical implications: aircraft engines produce less thrust at high altitude due to lower air density, climbers on high mountains need supplemental oxygen because fewer oxygen molecules are available per breath, and cooking takes longer at high altitude because water boils at lower temperatures due to reduced pressure.

</div>
</div>

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Give an example in which density is used to identify the substance composing an object. Would information in addition to average density be needed to identify the substances in an object composed of more than one material?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider practical applications where measuring density helps identify materials, and analyze what additional information would be needed for composite materials.

**Solution:**
**Example: Testing gold jewelry for authenticity**

A jeweler can determine if a piece of jewelry is solid gold by measuring its density:
1. Measure the mass using a precise balance
2. Measure the volume by water displacement (Archimedes' method)
3. Calculate density: $$ \rho = m/V $$
4. Compare to known gold density ($$ 19.32 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$)

If the measured density matches gold's known density, the object is likely pure gold. If significantly different, it may be gold-plated or a gold alloy.

**For objects composed of multiple materials: Yes, additional information is needed.**

Average density alone cannot uniquely identify a mixture because:
- Different combinations can yield the same average density
- A mixture of lead ($$ \rho = 11.3 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$) and aluminum ($$ \rho = 2.7 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$) could have the same average density as pure iron ($$ \rho = 7.8 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$)

Additional information needed might include:
- Visual inspection or sectioning to identify components
- Chemical analysis or spectroscopy
- X-ray imaging to reveal internal structure
- Melting point or other physical property measurements

**Discussion:**
Density measurements remain valuable for quality control and authenticity testing in many industries, from precious metals to food products. For example, the dairy industry uses density to detect watered-down milk, and petroleum refiners use density to characterize crude oil grades.

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a glass of ice water filled to the brim. Will the water overflow when the ice melts? Explain your answer.

![A glass filled to the brim with water and ice cubes.](../resources/Figure_11_02_03.jpg ' ')
{: #Figure3}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Apply Archimedes' principle: a floating object displaces a volume of water equal to its own weight. Compare the volume of water displaced by floating ice to the volume of water produced when the ice melts.

**Solution:**
**No, the water will not overflow when the ice melts.**

Here's why:
1. **Floating ice displaces water equal to its weight.** By Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force equals the weight of displaced water. For floating equilibrium:
   $$ \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{displaced}} \cdot g = \rho_{\text{ice}} \cdot V_{\text{ice}} \cdot g $$

2. **Volume displaced by floating ice:**
   $$ V_{\text{displaced}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{ice}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} \cdot V_{\text{ice}} $$

3. **Mass of ice equals mass of water it becomes:**
   $$ m_{\text{ice}} = m_{\text{water produced}} $$
   $$ \rho_{\text{ice}} \cdot V_{\text{ice}} = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{water produced}} $$

4. **Volume of water produced when ice melts:**
   $$ V_{\text{water produced}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{ice}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} \cdot V_{\text{ice}} $$

5. **These are equal!** The volume of water produced by melting ice exactly equals the volume the ice displaced while floating.

**Discussion:**
This elegant result explains why melting icebergs and sea ice (ice floating in the ocean) do not directly raise sea levels. However, melting glaciers and ice sheets on land *do* raise sea levels because that ice wasn't previously displacing ocean water. The density of ice ($$ 0.917 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$) being less than water ($$ 1.000 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$) is also why ice floats in the first place—an unusual property that allows aquatic life to survive under frozen lakes.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Gold is sold by the troy ounce (31.103 g). What is the volume of 1 troy ounce of pure gold?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the density formula $$ \rho = m/V $$ and solve for volume, using the density of gold from Table 1.

**Solution:**
Given:
- Mass: $$ m = 31.103 \text{ g} $$
- Gold density (from Table 1): $$ \rho = 19.32 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

Solving for volume:
$$ V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{31.103 \text{ g}}{19.32 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 1.610 \text{ cm}^3 $$

**Discussion:**
One troy ounce of gold has a volume of approximately **1.61 cm³**. This is surprisingly small—about the size of a sugar cube! Gold's extremely high density (19.32 g/cm³) means it packs a lot of mass into a small volume. This property makes gold valuable for coinage and jewelry: a small piece can be quite valuable. It also explains why gold bars are surprisingly small for their weight. For comparison, 1 troy ounce of aluminum would occupy about 11.5 cm³—over 7 times larger—highlighting gold's remarkable density.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Mercury is commonly supplied in flasks containing 34.5 kg (about 76 lb). What is the volume in liters of this much mercury?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the definition of density $$ \rho = m/V $$ to solve for volume. Look up the density of mercury from Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the density of mercury is:
$$ \rho_{\text{Hg}} = 13.6 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

Solving the density equation for volume:
$$ V = \frac{m}{\rho} $$

Substituting values:
$$ V = \frac{34.5 \text{ kg}}{13.6 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3} $$

$$ V = 2.54 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3 $$

Converting to liters ($$ 1 \text{ m}^3 = 1000 \text{ L} $$):
$$ V = 2.54 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3 \times \frac{1000 \text{ L}}{1 \text{ m}^3} = 2.54 \text{ L} $$

**Discussion:**
The volume of 34.5 kg of mercury is approximately **2.54 liters**. This is a surprisingly small volume for such a large mass—about the size of a large soda bottle. This illustrates mercury's extremely high density (13.6 times denser than water). The high density of mercury is why it was historically used in barometers and thermometers, as small volumes could provide significant measurable changes in height. The result is reasonable: mercury is one of the densest common liquids, so we expect a small volume for a given mass.

(a) What is the mass of a deep breath of air having a volume of 2.00 L? (b) Discuss the effect taking such a breath has on your body's volume and density.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the density formula $$ \rho = m/V $$ to find mass, using the density of air from Table 1.

**Solution:**

**(a) Mass of air:**

From Table 1, the density of air is $$ \rho_{\text{air}} = 1.29 \times 10^{-3} \text{ g/cm}^3 = 1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

Convert volume to m³:
<div class="equation">
$$ V = 2.00 \text{ L} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3 $$
</div>

Calculate mass using $$ m = \rho V $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ m = (1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3)(2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3) = 2.58 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg} = 2.58 \text{ g} $$
</div>

**(b) Effect on body volume and density:**

The volume of your body increases by the volume of air you inhale (2.00 L). The average density of your body decreases when you take a deep breath because the density of air (1.29 kg/m³) is substantially smaller than the average density of the human body (approximately 1010-1070 kg/m³, close to water).

**Discussion:**
The mass of a deep breath is approximately **2.58 g** (about 0.0057 pounds)—a surprisingly small mass for such a large volume. This demonstrates air's very low density compared to solids and liquids. The density decrease when inhaling has practical implications: taking a deep breath increases buoyancy when swimming because your average body density decreases toward that of water. This is why swimmers take a deep breath before floating and exhale to sink. The volume increase of 2 liters represents about 3-4% of typical body volume (~60 L for an average adult), causing a proportional decrease in average density.

A straightforward method of finding the density of an object is to measure its mass and then measure its volume by submerging it in a graduated cylinder. What is the density of a 240-g rock that displaces  $$ 89.0 {\text{cm}}^{3} $$
 of water? (Note that the accuracy and practical applications of this technique are more limited than a variety of others that are based on Archimedes' principle.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the definition of density $$ \rho = m/V $$, where the volume equals the water displaced.

**Solution:**
Given:
- Mass: $$ m = 240 \text{ g} $$
- Volume displaced: $$ V = 89.0 \text{ cm}^3 $$

Calculate density:
$$ \rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{240 \text{ g}}{89.0 \text{ cm}^3} = 2.70 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

**Discussion:**
The density of the rock is approximately **2.70 g/cm³** (or 2700 kg/m³). Comparing to Table 1, this density is close to that of aluminum (2.70 g/cm³) and also consistent with common rock types like granite (~2.7 g/cm³) or limestone (~2.3-2.7 g/cm³). The method works because the volume of water displaced equals the volume of the submerged object. While simple, this technique has limitations: it requires that the object be completely submerged, doesn't absorb water, and that any air bubbles are removed. More sophisticated techniques based on Archimedes' principle (like measuring apparent weight in water) can be more accurate and versatile.

Suppose you have a coffee mug with a circular cross section and vertical sides (uniform radius). What is its inside radius if it holds 375 g of coffee when filled to a depth of 7.50 cm? Assume coffee has the same density as water.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First find the volume of coffee using density, then use the volume formula for a cylinder to solve for the radius.

**Solution:**
*Step 1: Find the volume of coffee*

Using density to find volume (with $$ \rho_{\text{water}} = 1.00 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$):
$$ V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{375 \text{ g}}{1.00 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 375 \text{ cm}^3 $$

*Step 2: Use the cylinder volume formula to find radius*

For a cylinder with circular cross section:
$$ V = \pi r^2 h $$

Solving for radius:
$$ r^2 = \frac{V}{\pi h} $$

$$ r = \sqrt{\frac{V}{\pi h}} $$

Substituting values (with $$ h = 7.50 \text{ cm} $$):
$$ r = \sqrt{\frac{375 \text{ cm}^3}{\pi \times 7.50 \text{ cm}}} $$

$$ r = \sqrt{\frac{375 \text{ cm}^3}{23.56 \text{ cm}}} $$

$$ r = \sqrt{15.92 \text{ cm}^2} $$

$$ r = 3.99 \text{ cm} \approx 4.0 \text{ cm} $$

**Discussion:**
The inside radius of the coffee mug is approximately **4.0 cm** (or about 1.6 inches in diameter = 3.2 inches). This is a reasonable size for a typical coffee mug. The calculation confirms the geometry is sensible: a mug about 8 cm (3.2 inches) in inside diameter and 7.5 cm deep would hold about 375 mL of coffee, which is a typical large cup of coffee.

(a) A rectangular gasoline tank can hold 50.0 kg of gasoline when full. What is the depth of the tank if it is 0.500-m wide by 0.900-m long? (b) Discuss whether this gas tank has a reasonable volume for a passenger car.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First, find the volume of gasoline using its density from Table 1, then use the volume formula for a rectangular tank to find the depth.

**Solution:**

**(a) Find the depth:**

From Table 1, gasoline (petrol) has density $$ \rho = 0.68 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 = 680 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

Find the volume using $$ V = m/\rho $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ V = \frac{50.0 \text{ kg}}{680 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.0735 \text{ m}^3 $$
</div>

For a rectangular tank, $$ V = L \times W \times h $$. Solving for depth (height):
<div class="equation">
$$ h = \frac{V}{L \times W} = \frac{0.0735 \text{ m}^3}{(0.900 \text{ m})(0.500 \text{ m})} = \frac{0.0735 \text{ m}^3}{0.450 \text{ m}^2} = 0.163 \text{ m} $$
</div>

**(b) Is this reasonable for a passenger car?**

Convert volume to gallons (1 m³ = 264.2 gallons):
<div class="equation">
$$ V = 0.0735 \text{ m}^3 \times 264.2 \frac{\text{gal}}{\text{m}^3} = 19.4 \text{ gallons} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The tank depth is approximately **0.163 m** (about 6.4 inches), and the tank holds **19.4 gallons**. This is a reasonable tank size for a passenger car. Most modern passenger cars have fuel tanks in the range of 12-20 gallons, with compact cars typically having 12-15 gallons and larger sedans or SUVs having 15-25 gallons. The dimensions (90 cm × 50 cm × 16.3 cm) are also practical for installation under the rear of a vehicle. The relatively shallow depth allows the tank to fit in the space between the vehicle floor and undercarriage while still providing adequate fuel capacity for a driving range of 300-400 miles.

A trash compactor can reduce the volume of its contents to 0.350 their original value. Neglecting the mass of air expelled, by what factor is the density of the rubbish increased?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Since mass is conserved (neglecting expelled air), use the density formula $$ \rho = m/V $$ to find how density changes when volume decreases.

**Solution:**
Let the original density be $$ \rho_0 $$ with original volume $$ V_0 $$ and mass $$ m $$:
$$ \rho_0 = \frac{m}{V_0} $$

After compaction, the new volume is:
$$ V_{\text{new}} = 0.350 \cdot V_0 $$

The new density (with mass unchanged) is:
$$ \rho_{\text{new}} = \frac{m}{V_{\text{new}}} = \frac{m}{0.350 \cdot V_0} $$

The ratio of new density to original density:
$$ \frac{\rho_{\text{new}}}{\rho_0} = \frac{m/(0.350 \cdot V_0)}{m/V_0} = \frac{1}{0.350} = 2.86 $$

**Discussion:**
The density of the compacted rubbish is increased by a factor of approximately **2.86** (or about 2.9). This makes physical sense: if the volume is reduced to about one-third while mass stays constant, the density must roughly triple. Trash compactors are effective because they reduce waste volume significantly, allowing more trash to fit in the same container or landfill space. The expelled air has negligible mass compared to the solid waste, making our assumption reasonable.

A 2.50-kg steel gasoline can holds 20.0 L of gasoline when full. What is the average density of the full gas can, taking into account the volume occupied by steel as well as by gasoline?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Find the total mass (steel + gasoline), the total volume (steel + gasoline), then calculate average density. Use densities from Table 1 for gasoline and steel.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Find the mass of gasoline*

From Table 1, gasoline has density $$ \rho_{\text{gas}} = 0.68 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 = 680 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

Convert volume: $$ V_{\text{gas}} = 20.0 \text{ L} = 0.0200 \text{ m}^3 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{gas}} = \rho_{\text{gas}} V_{\text{gas}} = (680 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.0200 \text{ m}^3) = 13.6 \text{ kg} $$
</div>

*Step 2: Find the volume of steel*

From Table 1, steel has density $$ \rho_{\text{steel}} = 7.8 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ V_{\text{steel}} = \frac{m_{\text{steel}}}{\rho_{\text{steel}}} = \frac{2.50 \text{ kg}}{7800 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 3.21 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3 $$
</div>

*Step 3: Calculate average density*

Total mass: $$ m_{\text{total}} = 2.50 + 13.6 = 16.1 \text{ kg} $$

Total volume: $$ V_{\text{total}} = 0.0200 + 3.21 \times 10^{-4} = 0.0203 \text{ m}^3 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \rho_{\text{avg}} = \frac{m_{\text{total}}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{16.1 \text{ kg}}{0.0203 \text{ m}^3} = 793 \text{ kg/m}^3 \approx 7.9 \times 10^{2} \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The average density of the full gas can is approximately **790 kg/m³**. This is remarkably close to the density of gasoline alone (680 kg/m³), even though the can is made of steel (7800 kg/m³). This is because the steel can holds a much larger volume of the less dense gasoline. The steel's volume contribution is only about 1.6% of the total volume, so it has minimal effect on the average density. This result makes physical sense: the can would still float high in water (which has density 1000 kg/m³), though not as high as gasoline alone would float.

What is the density of 18.0-karat gold that is a mixture of 18 parts gold, 5 parts silver, and 1 part copper? (These values are parts by mass, not volume.) Assume that this is a simple mixture having an average density equal to the weighted densities of its constituents.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Calculate the weighted average of the densities based on mass fractions. First determine mass fractions, then find volumes occupied by each component, and finally calculate overall density.

**Solution:**

From Table 1:
- Gold density: $$ \rho_{\text{Au}} = 19.32 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$
- Silver density: $$ \rho_{\text{Ag}} = 10.5 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$ (standard value)
- Copper density: $$ \rho_{\text{Cu}} = 8.8 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

*Step 1: Find mass fractions*

Total parts by mass: $$ 18 + 5 + 1 = 24 $$ parts

Mass fractions:
- Gold: $$ f_{\text{Au}} = 18/24 = 0.750 $$
- Silver: $$ f_{\text{Ag}} = 5/24 = 0.208 $$
- Copper: $$ f_{\text{Cu}} = 1/24 = 0.0417 $$

*Step 2: Calculate average density*

For a mixture where we know mass fractions, the total volume for mass $$ m $$ is:
<div class="equation">
$$ V_{\text{total}} = \frac{m_{\text{Au}}}{\rho_{\text{Au}}} + \frac{m_{\text{Ag}}}{\rho_{\text{Ag}}} + \frac{m_{\text{Cu}}}{\rho_{\text{Cu}}} = m \left( \frac{f_{\text{Au}}}{\rho_{\text{Au}}} + \frac{f_{\text{Ag}}}{\rho_{\text{Ag}}} + \frac{f_{\text{Cu}}}{\rho_{\text{Cu}}} \right) $$
</div>

The average density is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \rho_{\text{avg}} = \frac{m}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{f_{\text{Au}}}{\rho_{\text{Au}}} + \frac{f_{\text{Ag}}}{\rho_{\text{Ag}}} + \frac{f_{\text{Cu}}}{\rho_{\text{Cu}}}} $$
</div>

Substituting values:
<div class="equation">
$$ \rho_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\frac{0.750}{19.32} + \frac{0.208}{10.5} + \frac{0.0417}{8.8}} = \frac{1}{0.03882 + 0.01981 + 0.00474} = \frac{1}{0.06337} = 15.8 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$
</div>

Rounding to three significant figures: $$ \rho_{\text{avg}} \approx 15.6 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

**Discussion:**
The density of 18-karat gold is approximately **15.6 g/cm³** (or 15,600 kg/m³). This is significantly less than pure 24-karat gold (19.32 g/cm³) because the added silver and copper are less dense. The 18-karat designation means 18/24 = 75% gold by mass, with the remainder being alloying metals. These alloys are used in jewelry because pure gold is too soft for practical use—the added metals increase hardness and durability while reducing cost. Different karat values indicate different gold fractions: 14-karat is 14/24 = 58.3% gold, 10-karat is 41.7% gold. Measuring density is one method jewelers use to verify gold purity, though it cannot distinguish between different alloy compositions with similar densities.

There is relatively little empty space between atoms in solids and liquids, so that the average density of an atom is about the same as matter on a macroscopic scale—approximately  $$10^{3} {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ .
 The nucleus of an atom has a radius about  $$10^{-5} $$
 that of the atom and contains nearly all the mass of the entire atom. (a) What is the approximate density of a nucleus? (b) One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus. What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun (the radius of the Sun is  $$7\times 10^{8}  \text{m} $$ )  ?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use the fact that nearly all the atom's mass is in the nucleus, which has a much smaller volume than the atom. The density ratio equals the inverse of the volume ratio.
(b) Use the mass and density to find volume, then calculate radius from the volume of a sphere.

**Solution:**

**(a) Density of a nucleus:**

The density ratio is the inverse of the volume ratio. If the nucleus radius is $$ 10^{-5} $$ times the atom radius:

<div class="equation">
$$ r_{\text{nucleus}} = 10^{-5} r_{\text{atom}} $$
</div>

The volume of a sphere is $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 $$, so:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{V_{\text{nucleus}}}{V_{\text{atom}}} = \frac{r_{\text{nucleus}}^3}{r_{\text{atom}}^3} = (10^{-5})^3 = 10^{-15} $$
</div>

Since the nucleus contains nearly all the mass:

<div class="equation">
$$ \rho_{\text{nucleus}} = \frac{m_{\text{atom}}}{V_{\text{nucleus}}} = \frac{m_{\text{atom}}}{10^{-15} V_{\text{atom}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{atom}}}{10^{-15}} = \frac{10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3}{10^{-15}} = 10^{18} \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
</div>

**(b) Radius of neutron star:**

Mass of neutron star: $$ M = 10 M_{\text{Sun}} = 10(2.0 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}) = 2.0 \times 10^{31} \text{ kg} $$

Using $$ \rho = M/V $$ and $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ r^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} = \frac{3(2.0 \times 10^{31} \text{ kg})}{4\pi (10^{18} \text{ kg/m}^3)} = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{31}}{1.26 \times 10^{19}} = 4.76 \times 10^{12} \text{ m}^3 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ r = (4.76 \times 10^{12})^{1/3} \text{ m} = 1.68 \times 10^{4} \text{ m} \approx 2 \times 10^{4} \text{ m} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
(a) The nuclear density is approximately **10¹⁸ kg/m³**—a trillion times denser than ordinary matter! This enormous density results from packing nearly all the atom's mass into a volume that is 10⁻¹⁵ times smaller.

(b) The neutron star radius is approximately **20 km** (about 12 miles). This is astonishingly small for an object with 10 times the Sun's mass—the Sun itself has a radius of 700,000 km. This dramatic compression (radius reduction by a factor of 35,000) demonstrates the extreme density of neutron stars. These stellar remnants are formed when massive stars collapse in supernovae, crushing matter to nuclear densities. A sugar-cube-sized sample of neutron star material would have a mass of about a billion tons! The result is reasonable: neutron stars are indeed observed to have radii of 10-20 km with masses of 1-3 solar masses, confirming they have densities comparable to atomic nuclei.
