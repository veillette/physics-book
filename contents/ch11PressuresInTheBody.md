### Pressure in the Body

Next to taking a person’s temperature and weight, measuring blood pressure is
the most common of all medical examinations. Control of high blood pressure is
largely responsible for the significant decreases in heart attack and stroke
fatalities achieved in the last three decades. The pressures in various parts of
the body can be measured and often provide valuable medical indicators. In this
section, we consider a few examples together with some of the physics that
accompanies them.

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists some of the measured pressures in mm Hg, the units
most commonly quoted.

### Blood Pressure

Common arterial blood pressure measurements typically produce values of 120 mm
Hg and 80 mm Hg, respectively, for systolic and diastolic pressures. Both
pressures have health implications. When systolic pressure is chronically high,
the risk of stroke and heart attack is increased. If, however, it is too low,
fainting is a problem. **Systolic pressure** increases dramatically during
exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal afterward. This change
produces no ill effects and, in fact, may be beneficial to the tone of the
circulatory system. **Diastolic pressure** can be an indicator of fluid balance.
When low, it may indicate that a person is hemorrhaging internally and needs a
transfusion. Conversely, high diastolic pressure indicates a ballooning of the
blood vessels, which may be due to the transfusion of too much fluid into the
circulatory system. High diastolic pressure is also an indication that blood
vessels are not dilating properly to pass blood through. This can seriously
strain the heart in its attempt to pump blood.

Blood leaves the heart at about 120 mm Hg but its pressure continues to
decrease (to almost 0) as it goes from the aorta to smaller arteries to small
veins (see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). The pressure differences in the circulation
system are caused by blood flow through the system as well as the position of
the person. For a person standing up, the pressure in the feet will be larger
than at the heart due to the weight of the blood $$\left(P=h \rho g\right) $$ .
If we assume that the distance between the heart and the feet of a person in an
upright position is 1.4 m, then the increase in pressure in the feet relative to
that in the heart (for a static column of blood) is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta P=\Delta h \rho g=\left(1.4 m\right)\left(1050 \text{kg}{\text{/m}}^{3}\right)\left(9.80 m{\text{/s}}^{2}\right)= 1.4 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa}=108 \text{mm Hg}. $$
</div>

Increase in Pressure in the Feet of a Person

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta P=\Delta h \rho g=\left(1.4 m\right)\left(1050 \text{kg}{\text{/m}}^{3}\right)\left(9.80 m{\text{/s}}^{2}\right)= 1.4 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa}=108 \text{mm Hg}. $$
</div>
</div>

Standing a long time can lead to an accumulation of blood in the legs and
swelling. This is the reason why soldiers who are required to stand still for
long periods of time have been known to faint. Elastic bandages around the calf
can help prevent this accumulation and can also help provide increased pressure
to enable the veins to send blood back up to the heart. For similar reasons,
doctors recommend tight stockings for long-haul flights.

Blood pressure may also be measured in the major veins, the heart chambers,
arteries to the brain, and the lungs. But these pressures are usually only
monitored during surgery or for patients in intensive care since the
measurements are invasive. To obtain these pressure measurements, qualified
health care workers thread thin tubes, called catheters, into appropriate
locations to transmit pressures to external measuring devices.

The heart consists of two pumps—the right side forcing blood through the lungs
and the left causing blood to flow through the rest of the
body ([[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Right-heart failure, for example, results in a
rise in the pressure in the vena cavae and a drop in pressure in the arteries to
the lungs. Left-heart failure results in a rise in the pressure entering the
left side of the heart and a drop in aortal pressure. Implications of these and
other pressures on flow in the circulatory system will be discussed in more
detail
in [Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications](../contents/ch12FluidDynamicsAndItsBiologicalApplications)

### Pressure in the Eye

The shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure, called **intraocular
pressure**, which is normally in the range of 12.0 to 24.0 mm Hg. When the
circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in
pressure, a condition called **glaucoma**. The net pressure can become as great
as 85.0 mm Hg, an abnormally large pressure that can permanently damage the
optic nerve. To get an idea of the force involved, suppose the back of the eye
has an area of $$ 6.0 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ , and the net pressure is 85.0 mm Hg.
Force is given by $$F=PA $$ . To get $$F $$ in newtons, we convert the area to
$${\text{m}}^{2} $$
(  $${1 \text{m}}^{2}=10^{4} {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ ). Then we calculate as follows:

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=h\rho \text{gA}=\left( 85.0 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}\right)\left( 13.6 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\left( 6.0 \times 10^{-4}  {\text{m}}^{2}\right)=6.8 N. $$
</div>

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Eye Pressure
</div>
The shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure, called intraocular pressure. When the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in pressure, a condition called glaucoma. The force is calculated as

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=h\rho \text{gA}=\left( 85.0 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}\right)\left( 13.6 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\left( 6.0 \times 10^{-4}  {\text{m}}^{2}\right)=6.8 N. $$
</div>
</div>

This force is the weight of about a 680-g mass. A mass of 680 g resting on the
eye (imagine 1.5 lb resting on your eye) would be sufficient to cause it
damage. (A normal force here would be the weight of about 120 g, less than
one-quarter of our initial value.)

People over 40 years of age are at greatest risk of developing glaucoma and
should have their intraocular pressure tested routinely. Most measurements
involve exerting a force on the (anesthetized) eye over some area (a pressure)
and observing the eye’s response. A noncontact approach uses a puff of air and a
measurement is made of the force needed to indent the
eye ([[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). If the intraocular pressure is high, the eye will
deform less and rebound more vigorously than normal. Excessive intraocular
pressures can be detected reliably and sometimes controlled effectively.

Calculating Gauge Pressure and Depth: Damage to the Eardrum
</div>
Suppose a 3.00-N force can rupture an eardrum. (a) If the eardrum has an area of  $$ 1.00 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ ,
 calculate the maximum tolerable gauge pressure on the eardrum in newtons per meter squared and convert it to millimeters of mercury. (b) At what depth in freshwater would this person’s eardrum rupture, assuming the gauge pressure in the middle ear is zero?

**Strategy for (a)**

The pressure can be found directly from its definition since we know the force
and area. We are looking for the gauge pressure.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{g}}=F/A= 3.00 \text{N}/\left( 1.00 \times 10^{-4}  {\text{m}}^{2}\right)= 3.00 \times 10^{4}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}. $$
</div>
We now need to convert this to units of mm Hg:

<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{g}}= 3.0 \times 10^{4}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}\left(\frac{1.0 mm Hg}{133 {\text{N/m}}^{2}}\right)=226 \text{mm Hg.} $$
</div>
**Strategy for (b)**

Here we will use the fact that the water pressure varies linearly with depth $$h $$

below the surface.

**Solution for (b)**

$$P=h \rho g $$ and therefore $$h=P/\rho g $$ . Using the value above for $$P $$
, we have

<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{ 3.0 \times 10^{4}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}}{\left( 1.00 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left(9.80 m{\text{/s}}^{2}\right)}=3.06 m. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Similarly, increased pressure exerted upon the eardrum from the middle ear can
arise when an infection causes a fluid buildup.

</div>

### Pressure Associated with the Lungs

The pressure inside the lungs increases and decreases with each breath. The
pressure drops to below atmospheric pressure (negative gauge pressure) when you
inhale, causing air to flow into the lungs. It increases above atmospheric
pressure (positive gauge pressure) when you exhale, forcing air out.

Lung pressure is controlled by several mechanisms. Muscle action in the
diaphragm and rib cage is necessary for inhalation; this muscle action increases
the volume of the lungs thereby reducing the pressure within
them [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive
pressure opposing inhalation. (
See [Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action](../contents/ch11CohesionAndAdhesionInLiquids)
.) You can exhale without muscle action by letting surface tension in the
alveoli create its own positive pressure. Muscle action can add to this positive
pressure to produce forced exhalation, such as when you blow up a balloon, blow
out a candle, or cough.

The lungs, in fact, would collapse due to the surface tension in the alveoli, if
they were not attached to the inside of the chest wall by liquid adhesion. The
gauge pressure in the liquid attaching the lungs to the inside of the chest wall
is thus negative, ranging from $$-4 $$ to $$-8 \text{mm Hg} $$ during exhalation
and inhalation, respectively. If air is allowed to enter the chest cavity, it
breaks the attachment, and one or both lungs may collapse. Suction is applied to
the chest cavity of surgery patients and trauma victims to reestablish negative
pressure and inflate the lungs.

![The figures represent the inhalation and expiration process in the human body. It shows the working of the various muscles and the movement of the diaphragm that causes the variation in the pressure inside the lungs.](../resources/Figure_11_09_03.jpg "(a) During inhalation, muscles expand the chest, and the diaphragm moves downward, reducing pressure inside the lungs to less than atmospheric (negative gauge pressure). Pressure between the lungs and chest wall is even lower to overcome the positive pressure created by surface tension in the lungs. (b) During gentle exhalation, the muscles simply relax and surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive pressure inside the lungs, forcing air out. Pressure between the chest wall and lungs remains negative to keep them attached to the chest wall, but it is less negative than during inhalation.")

### Other Pressures in the Body

#### Spinal Column and Skull

Normally, there is a 5- to12-mm Hg pressure in the fluid surrounding the brain
and filling the spinal column. This cerebrospinal fluid serves many purposes,
one of which is to supply flotation to the brain. The buoyant force supplied by
the fluid nearly equals the weight of the brain, since their densities are
nearly equal. If there is a loss of fluid, the brain rests on the inside of the
skull, causing severe headaches, constricted blood flow, and serious damage.
Spinal fluid pressure is measured by means of a needle inserted between
vertebrae that transmits the pressure to a suitable measuring device.

#### Bladder Pressure

This bodily pressure is one of which we are often aware. In fact, there is a
relationship between our awareness of this pressure and a subsequent increase in
it. Bladder pressure climbs steadily from zero to about 25 mm Hg as the bladder
fills to its normal capacity of $$500 {\text{cm}}^{3} $$ . This pressure
triggers the **micturition reflex**, which stimulates the feeling of needing to
urinate. What is more, it also causes muscles around the bladder to contract,
raising the pressure to over 100 mm Hg, accentuating the sensation. Coughing,
straining, tensing in cold weather, wearing tight clothes, and experiencing
simple nervous tension all can increase bladder pressure and trigger this
reflex. So can the weight of a pregnant woman’s fetus, especially if it is
kicking vigorously or pushing down with its head! Bladder pressure can be
measured by a catheter or by inserting a needle through the bladder wall and
transmitting the pressure to an appropriate measuring device. One hazard of high
bladder pressure (sometimes created by an obstruction), is that such pressure
can force urine back into the kidneys, causing potentially severe damage.

#### Pressures in the Skeletal System

These pressures are the largest in the body, due both to the high values of
initial force, and the small areas to which this force is applied, such as in
the joints. For example, when a person lifts an object improperly, a force of
5000 N may be created between vertebrae in the spine, and this may be applied to
an area as small as $$10 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ . The pressure created is
$$P=F/A=\left(5000 \text{N}\right)/\left(10^{-3} {\text{m}}^{2}\right)= 5.0 \times 10^{6} {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ or about 50 atm! This pressure can damage both
the spinal discs (the cartilage between vertebrae), as well as the bony
vertebrae themselves. Even under normal circumstances, forces between vertebrae
in the spine are large enough to create pressures of several atmospheres. Most
causes of excessive pressure in the skeletal system can be avoided by lifting
properly and avoiding extreme physical activity. (
See [Forces and Torques in Muscles and Joints](./ch9ForcesAndTorquesInMusclesAndJoints).)

There are many other interesting and medically significant pressures in the
body. For example, pressure caused by various muscle actions drives food and
waste through the digestive system. Stomach pressure behaves much like bladder
pressure and is tied to the sensation of hunger. Pressure in the relaxed
esophagus is normally negative because pressure in the chest cavity is normally
negative. Positive pressure in the stomach may thus force acid into the
esophagus, causing “heartburn.” Pressure in the middle ear can result in
significant force on the eardrum if it differs greatly from atmospheric
pressure, such as while scuba diving. The decrease in external pressure is also
noticeable during plane flights (due to a decrease in the weight of air above
relative to that at the Earth’s surface). The Eustachian tubes connect the
middle ear to the throat and allow us to equalize pressure in the middle ear to
avoid an imbalance of force on the eardrum.

Many pressures in the human body are associated with the flow of fluids. Fluid
flow will be discussed in detail in
the [Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications](../contents/ch12FluidDynamicsAndItsBiologicalApplications)
.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
During forced exhalation, such as when blowing up a balloon, the diaphragm and chest muscles create a pressure of 60.0 mm Hg between the lungs and chest wall. What force in newtons does this pressure create on the  $$600 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$
 surface area of the diaphragm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Convert the pressure from mm Hg to Pa using $$ P = \rho g h $$, then use $$ F = PA $$ to find the force.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Convert pressure to pascals*

$$ P = h \rho_{\text{Hg}} g = (60.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})(13.6 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) $$

$$ P = 7.99 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa} $$

*Step 2: Convert area to m²*

$$ A = 600 \text{ cm}^2 = 600 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 0.0600 \text{ m}^2 $$

*Step 3: Calculate force*

$$ F = PA = (7.99 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa})(0.0600 \text{ m}^2) = 479 \text{ N} $$

**Discussion:**
The force on the diaphragm is approximately **479 N** (about 108 pounds). This substantial force is what allows forceful exhalation for activities like blowing up balloons, coughing, or playing wind instruments. The diaphragm is a strong, dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, and during forced exhalation, it contracts upward while chest muscles squeeze inward, compressing the lungs. This 60 mm Hg pressure (about 0.08 atm gauge) is modest compared to maximum efforts, where pressures can exceed 100 mm Hg. The large diaphragm area means even moderate pressures create significant forces.

You can chew through very tough objects with your incisors because they exert a large force on the small area of a pointed tooth. What pressure in pascals can you create by exerting a force of  $$500 \text{N} $$
 with your tooth on an area of  $$1.00 {\text{mm}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the definition of pressure, $$ P = \frac{F}{A} $$, with careful attention to unit conversion.

**Solution**

First, convert the area to square meters:

$$ A = 1.00 \text{ mm}^2 = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2 $$

Now calculate the pressure:

$$ P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{500 \text{ N}}{1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2} = 5.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ Pa} $$

The pressure created by the incisor is **5.00 × 10⁸ Pa** (or 500 MPa, approximately 5000 atm).

**Discussion**

This pressure is extremely high—about 5000 times atmospheric pressure! This explains why teeth can chew through tough materials like nuts, bones, and hard candy. The key is the small contact area at the tip of the tooth. Human bite force typically ranges from 300-700 N, and the pointed nature of incisors concentrates this force to create very high pressures. This is the same principle used by knives, needles, and other cutting/piercing tools.

One way to force air into an unconscious person's lungs is to squeeze on a balloon appropriately connected to the subject. What force must you exert on the balloon with your hands to create a gauge pressure of 4.00 cm water, assuming you squeeze on an effective area of  $$ 50.0 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Convert the pressure from cm water to Pa, then use $$ F = PA $$ to find the required force.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Convert pressure to pascals*

$$ P = h \rho_{\text{water}} g = (0.0400 \text{ m})(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) $$

$$ P = 392 \text{ Pa} $$

*Step 2: Convert area to m²*

$$ A = 50.0 \text{ cm}^2 = 50.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 5.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2 $$

*Step 3: Calculate force*

$$ F = PA = (392 \text{ Pa})(5.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2) = 1.96 \text{ N} $$

**Discussion:**
The required force is approximately **1.96 N** (about 0.44 pounds or 7 ounces). This is a modest force—easily applied by hand squeezing. The 4 cm water pressure (about 392 Pa or 0.004 atm) is sufficient to inflate the lungs without causing damage. Manual resuscitation devices (bag valve masks) work on this principle, allowing rescuers to provide ventilation by rhythmic squeezing. The relatively small force needed makes this technique accessible even during prolonged rescue efforts. Modern devices include pressure relief valves to prevent excessive pressures that could damage the lungs.

Heroes in movies hide beneath water and breathe through a hollow reed (villains never catch on to this trick). In practice, you cannot inhale in this manner if your lungs are more than 60.0 cm below the surface. What is the maximum negative gauge pressure you can create in your lungs on dry land, assuming you can achieve  $$-3.00 \text{cm} $$
 water pressure with your lungs 60.0 cm below the surface?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
When submerged, your lungs must overcome both the water pressure at depth and create the negative pressure for inhalation. Find the total negative pressure capability.

**Solution:**

When your lungs are 60.0 cm below the surface:
- Water pressure at lung depth: $$ P_{\text{water}} = \rho g h = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.600 \text{ m}) $$

Converting to cm water: $$ P_{\text{water}} = 60.0 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O} $$

If you can achieve −3.00 cm water pressure at the lung surface while submerged at 60.0 cm depth, you must create a pressure difference of:

$$ P_{\text{lung, abs}} = P_{\text{atm}} + 60.0 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O} - 3.00 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O} $$

To inhale, you must reduce lung pressure from atmospheric to this value. The total negative gauge pressure you can create is:

$$ P_{\text{max negative}} = -(60.0 + 3.00) \text{ cm H}_2\text{O} = -63.0 \text{ cm H}_2\text{O} $$

**Discussion:**
The maximum negative gauge pressure you can create in your lungs on dry land is approximately **−63.0 cm H₂O** (about −0.062 atm or −6.2 kPa). This represents the total pressure difference your respiratory muscles can generate. When submerged 60 cm deep, you need 60 cm H₂O just to counteract water pressure on your chest, leaving only 3 cm H₂O for actual air flow. Beyond about 60-70 cm depth, most people cannot generate sufficient negative pressure to inhale through a snorkel, which is why snorkels are limited to ~30-40 cm length (half the theoretical maximum, with safety margin). This limitation explains why scuba tanks are necessary for deeper diving—they provide pressurized air matching ambient water pressure.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use $$ F = PA $$ to find the force on each side of the skull. For gauge pressure in mm Hg, we convert using the density of mercury. The net force depends on whether opposing forces cancel.

**Solution**

(a) First, convert the pressure from mm Hg to Pascals using $$ P = h\rho g $$:

$$ P = (85.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})(13.6 \times 10^{3} \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 1.13 \times 10^{4} \text{ Pa} $$

Calculate the force on each side:

$$ F = PA = (1.13 \times 10^{4} \text{ Pa})(70.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2) = 79.4 \text{ N} $$

(b) The net force on the skull is **zero**. The pressure acts uniformly in all directions (Pascal's principle), so the outward force on one side of the skull is exactly balanced by the equal outward force on the opposite side.

The outward force on each side of the infant's skull is approximately **79 N** (about 18 pounds), and the net force is **0 N**.

**Discussion**

Although the net force is zero, the 79 N force on each side is significant—equivalent to about 8 kg (18 lb) pushing outward on each side of the skull. This is why elevated intracranial pressure can cause the skull bones of an infant (which haven't yet fused) to separate and the head to enlarge abnormally, a condition called hydrocephalus. The individual forces stretch the skull even though they don't accelerate it as a whole.

A full-term fetus typically has a mass of 3.50 kg. (a) What pressure does the weight of such a fetus create if it rests on the mother's bladder, supported on an area of  $$ 90.0 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ ?
 (b) Convert this pressure to millimeters of mercury and determine if it alone is great enough to trigger the micturition reflex (it will add to any pressure already existing in the bladder).

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Calculate the weight of the fetus, then use $$ P = F/A $$ to find pressure.
(b) Convert the pressure from Pa to mm Hg and compare to the threshold for the micturition reflex (about 25 mm Hg).

**Solution:**

**(a) Pressure in pascals:**

Calculate the weight of the fetus:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = mg = (3.50 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 34.3 \text{ N} $$
</div>

Convert area to m²:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = 90.0 \text{ cm}^2 = 90.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 9.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2 $$
</div>

Calculate pressure:
<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{34.3 \text{ N}}{9.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2} = 3.81 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa} $$
</div>

**(b) Convert to mm Hg:**

Using $$ 1 \text{ mm Hg} = 133 \text{ Pa} $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{3.81 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa}}{133 \text{ Pa/mm Hg}} = 28.7 \text{ mm Hg} $$
</div>

The pressure is **3.81 × 10³ Pa** or **28.7 mm Hg**, which is sufficient to trigger the micturition reflex (threshold is about 25 mm Hg).

**Discussion:**
The fetus creates a pressure of approximately **28.7 mm Hg** on the mother's bladder, exceeding the typical 25 mm Hg threshold that triggers the urge to urinate. This explains the frequent need to urinate during late pregnancy. The pressure is even greater when the fetus kicks or moves, as mentioned in the text, potentially raising bladder pressure above 100 mm Hg. This is one of the many physiological changes expectant mothers experience as the growing fetus compresses various organs in the abdominal cavity.

If the pressure in the esophagus is  $$-2.00 \text{mm Hg} $$
 while that in the stomach is  $$+20.0 \text{mm Hg} $$ ,
 to what height could stomach fluid rise in the esophagus, assuming a density of 1.10 g/mL? (This movement will not occur if the muscle closing the lower end of the esophagus is working properly.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The pressure difference between the stomach and esophagus will push fluid up until the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column equals the pressure difference. We use $$ \Delta P = \rho g h $$ and solve for height.

**Solution**

The pressure difference is:

$$ \Delta P = P_{\text{stomach}} - P_{\text{esophagus}} = (+20.0 \text{ mm Hg}) - (-2.00 \text{ mm Hg}) = 22.0 \text{ mm Hg} $$

Convert to Pascals:

$$ \Delta P = (22.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})(13.6 \times 10^{3} \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 2.93 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa} $$

The density of stomach fluid is $$ \rho = 1.10 \text{ g/mL} = 1100 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$.

Solve for height using $$ h = \frac{\Delta P}{\rho g} $$:

$$ h = \frac{2.93 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa}}{(1100 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)} = 0.272 \text{ m} = 27.2 \text{ cm} $$

Stomach fluid could rise to a height of approximately **27 cm** in the esophagus.

**Discussion**

This is a significant height—about 10-11 inches—more than enough to reach the throat and cause severe "heartburn" or acid reflux. The lower esophageal sphincter muscle normally prevents this by maintaining a barrier between the stomach and esophagus. When this sphincter is weakened or relaxed inappropriately, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can result. The negative pressure in the esophagus (due to the negative pressure in the chest cavity) actually contributes to pulling stomach acid upward when the sphincter fails.

**Strategy:**
(a) Convert the pressure from mm Hg to cm H₂O using the density ratio between mercury and water.
(b) When the person sits up, add the hydrostatic pressure of the 60-cm column of spinal fluid to the baseline pressure.

**Solution:**

**(a) Manometer reading when lying down:**

The pressure relationship is $$ P = \rho g h $$. For the same pressure in different fluids:
<div class="equation">
$$ P_{\text{Hg}} = P_{\text{H₂O}} $$
$$ \rho_{\text{Hg}} g h_{\text{Hg}} = \rho_{\text{H₂O}} g h_{\text{H₂O}} $$
</div>

Solving for water height:
<div class="equation">
$$ h_{\text{H₂O}} = h_{\text{Hg}} \frac{\rho_{\text{Hg}}}{\rho_{\text{H₂O}}} = (10.0 \text{ mm}) \frac{13.6 \text{ g/cm}^3}{1.00 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 136 \text{ mm} = 13.6 \text{ cm H₂O} $$
</div>

**(b) Manometer reading when sitting up:**

When the person sits up, the 60-cm column of spinal fluid adds hydrostatic pressure. Using spinal fluid density $$ \rho_{\text{CSF}} = 1.05 \text{ g/mL} = 1050 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta P = \rho_{\text{CSF}} g h = (1050 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.60 \text{ m}) = 6174 \text{ Pa} $$
</div>

Convert to cm H₂O:
<div class="equation">
$$ h_{\text{additional}} = \frac{\Delta P}{\rho_{\text{H₂O}} g} = \frac{6174 \text{ Pa}}{(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)} = 0.630 \text{ m} = 63.0 \text{ cm H₂O} $$
</div>

Total reading:
<div class="equation">
$$ h_{\text{total}} = 13.6 + 63.0 = 76.6 \text{ cm H₂O} \approx 76.5 \text{ cm H₂O} $$
</div>

The readings are: (a) **13.6 cm H₂O** when lying down, and (b) **76.5 cm H₂O** when sitting up.

**Discussion:**
The dramatic increase from 13.6 cm to 76.5 cm when sitting up (more than 5-fold) demonstrates how body position affects pressure measurements in the spinal fluid. This is why spinal pressure measurements must be performed with the patient in a standardized position (usually lying on their side). The increased pressure when upright reflects the weight of the fluid column between the brain and the measurement point in the lower back. This principle is important in diagnosing conditions like hydrocephalus (excess cerebrospinal fluid) or CSF leaks. The slight density difference between spinal fluid (1.05 g/mL) and water (1.00 g/mL) accounts for the 63 cm contribution rather than exactly 60 cm.

Calculate the maximum force in newtons exerted by the blood on an aneurysm, or ballooning, in a major artery, given the maximum blood pressure for this person is 150 mm Hg and the effective area of the aneurysm is  $$ 20.0 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$ .
 Note that this force is great enough to cause further enlargement and subsequently greater force on the ever-thinner vessel wall.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use $$ F = PA $$ after converting the blood pressure from mm Hg to Pascals and the area to square meters.

**Solution**

Convert the pressure from mm Hg to Pascals:

$$ P = (150 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})(13.6 \times 10^{3} \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 2.00 \times 10^{4} \text{ Pa} $$

Convert the area: $$ A = 20.0 \text{ cm}^2 = 20.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 $$

Calculate the force:

$$ F = PA = (2.00 \times 10^{4} \text{ Pa})(20.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2) = 40.0 \text{ N} $$

The maximum force exerted by blood on the aneurysm is **40.0 N** (approximately 9 pounds).

**Discussion**

This is a substantial force—equivalent to about 4 kg (9 lb) pushing outward on the weakened vessel wall. Aneurysms are particularly dangerous because of a positive feedback loop: as the vessel wall stretches and thins, the area increases, causing greater force (F = PA), which causes further stretching. The wall also becomes weaker as it thins, following Laplace's law. This explains why aneurysms can grow progressively and eventually rupture catastrophically. The 150 mm Hg systolic pressure used here is elevated (normal is ~120 mm Hg), illustrating why high blood pressure significantly increases the risk of aneurysm rupture.

During heavy lifting, a disk between spinal vertebrae is subjected to a 5000-N compressional force. (a) What pressure is created, assuming that the disk has a uniform circular cross section 2.00 cm in radius? (b) What deformation is produced if the disk is 0.800 cm thick and has a Young's modulus of  $$ 1.5 \times 10^{9}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use $$ P = F/A $$ with the disk's cross-sectional area.
(b) Use the relationship between stress, strain, and Young's modulus: $$ \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{F/A}{Y} = \frac{P}{Y} $$.

**Solution:**

**(a) Pressure in the disk:**

Calculate the disk's cross-sectional area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.0200 \text{ m})^2 = 1.257 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2 $$
</div>

Calculate pressure:
<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{5000 \text{ N}}{1.257 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2} = 3.98 \times 10^{6} \text{ Pa} $$
</div>

**(b) Deformation of the disk:**

Using the relationship for compressive deformation:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = L_0 \frac{P}{Y} = (0.00800 \text{ m}) \frac{3.98 \times 10^{6} \text{ Pa}}{1.5 \times 10^{9} \text{ Pa}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta L = (0.00800 \text{ m})(2.65 \times 10^{-3}) = 2.12 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m} = 2.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm} $$
</div>

The pressure created is **3.98 × 10⁶ Pa** (about 39 atmospheres), and the deformation is **2.1 × 10⁻³ cm** (0.021 mm).

**Discussion:**
The pressure of approximately **4.0 MPa** (40 times atmospheric pressure) shows the significant stress placed on spinal disks during heavy lifting. The compression of **0.021 mm** may seem small, but it represents about 0.26% of the disk's 8-mm thickness. Repeated compressions of this magnitude contribute to disk wear and can lead to herniated disks or degenerative disk disease over time.

This calculation assumes the disk compresses uniformly, but in reality, the soft gel-like nucleus pulposus in the center can bulge outward when compressed, potentially pressing on spinal nerves and causing pain. This is why proper lifting technique (keeping the back straight and lifting with the legs) is crucial—it helps distribute forces more evenly across multiple disks rather than concentrating stress on one or two. The relatively low Young's modulus (1.5 GPa, compared to ~200 GPa for steel) reflects the disk's cartilaginous composition, which allows it to act as a shock absorber for the spine.

When a person sits erect, increasing the vertical position of their brain by 36.0 cm, the heart must continue to pump blood to the brain at the same rate. (a) What is the gain in gravitational potential energy for 100 mL of blood raised 36.0 cm? (b) What is the drop in pressure, neglecting any losses due to friction? (c) Discuss how the gain in gravitational potential energy and the decrease in pressure are related.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

(a) We calculate gravitational potential energy using $$ \Delta PE = mgh $$, where mass comes from volume and density.
(b) The pressure drop due to height change is given by $$ \Delta P = \rho g h $$.
(c) We connect these through work-energy considerations.

**Solution**

(a) First find the mass of 100 mL of blood (using blood density ≈ 1050 kg/m³):

$$ m = \rho V = (1050 \text{ kg/m}^3)(100 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3) = 0.105 \text{ kg} $$

Calculate the potential energy gain:

$$ \Delta PE = mgh = (0.105 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.360 \text{ m}) = 0.370 \text{ J} $$

(b) The pressure drop due to height increase:

$$ \Delta P = \rho g h = (1050 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.360 \text{ m}) = 3.70 \times 10^{3} \text{ Pa} $$

Converting to mm Hg: $$ \Delta P = \frac{3700 \text{ Pa}}{133 \text{ Pa/mm Hg}} = 27.8 \text{ mm Hg} $$

The gravitational potential energy gain is **0.370 J**, and the pressure drop is **3.70 × 10³ Pa** (or about 28 mm Hg).

(c) **Discussion**: The gain in gravitational potential energy and the decrease in pressure are directly related through energy conservation. As blood rises to the brain, its gravitational potential energy increases while its pressure energy (per unit volume) decreases by the same amount. The work done against gravity equals $$ \Delta PE = mgh = (\rho V)gh $$, while the pressure energy change equals $$ \Delta P \cdot V = \rho gh \cdot V $$. These are identical, demonstrating that the pressure drop provides the energy needed to lift the blood. This is why blood pressure is lower in the head than at heart level when standing, and why the heart must work harder to maintain adequate brain perfusion when upright. This also explains why standing suddenly can cause lightheadedness—the body needs time to adjust blood pressure to compensate for gravitational effects.

(a) How high will water rise in a glass capillary tube with a 0.500-mm radius? (b) How much gravitational potential energy does the water gain? (c) Discuss possible sources of this energy.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use the capillary rise formula $$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} $$ with water's surface tension and contact angle with glass.
(b) Calculate the mass of the water column and use $$ \Delta PE = mgh/2 $$ (center of mass rises by h/2).
(c) Relate the energy to work done by surface tension forces.

**Solution:**

**(a) Height of capillary rise:**

For water in glass at 20°C:
- Surface tension: $$ \gamma = 0.0728 \text{ N/m} $$
- Contact angle: $$ \theta = 0° $$ (so $$ \cos\theta = 1 $$)
- Density: $$ \rho = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
- Radius: $$ r = 0.500 \text{ mm} = 5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r} = \frac{2(0.0728 \text{ N/m})(1)}{(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m})} = \frac{0.1456}{4.90} = 0.0297 \text{ m} = 2.97 \text{ cm} $$
</div>

**(b) Gravitational potential energy gained:**

Volume of water column:
<div class="equation">
$$ V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m})^2(0.0297 \text{ m}) = 2.33 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m}^3 $$
</div>

Mass of water:
<div class="equation">
$$ m = \rho V = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(2.33 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m}^3) = 2.33 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg} $$
</div>

The center of mass rises by $$ h/2 $$, so:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta PE = mg(h/2) = (2.33 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.0297 \text{ m}/2) = 3.39 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J} $$
</div>

**(c) Source of the energy:**

Work is done by the surface tension force through an effective distance $$ h/2 $$ to raise the column of water. The surface tension acts along the perimeter of the meniscus ($$ 2\pi r $$) with force $$ F = \gamma (2\pi r) $$. As the water rises to height $$ h $$, the point of application (the meniscus) moves upward by $$ h $$, but the center of mass only rises by $$ h/2 $$. The work done equals:

<div class="equation">
$$ W = F \cdot d = [\gamma (2\pi r)] \cdot (h/2) = \gamma \pi r h $$
</div>

This can be verified:
<div class="equation">
$$ W = (0.0728 \text{ N/m})(\pi)(5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m})(0.0297 \text{ m}) = 3.40 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J} $$
</div>

This matches the potential energy gain (within rounding error), confirming energy conservation.

**Discussion:**
Water rises to **2.97 cm** and gains **3.39 µJ** of potential energy. The energy comes from the work done by adhesive forces (water-glass attraction) as manifested through surface tension. As the water climbs the tube walls, the surface area of the water-glass interface increases while the water-air interface decreases. The favorable water-glass interaction (lower energy) compared to water-air interaction drives this process. Energy conservation requires that the work done by surface tension equals the gravitational potential energy gained, which our calculations confirm.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

(a) We use $$ h = \frac{P}{\rho g} $$ to find the height water could be raised by the negative pressure.
(b) For the steel wire, we use the relationship between stress, strain, and Young's modulus: $$ \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{\sigma}{Y} = \frac{P}{Y} $$.

**Solution**

(a) Convert pressure to Pascals: $$ P = 25.0 \text{ atm} \times 1.013 \times 10^{5} \text{ Pa/atm} = 2.53 \times 10^{6} \text{ Pa} $$

Calculate the height:

$$ h = \frac{P}{\rho g} = \frac{2.53 \times 10^{6} \text{ Pa}}{(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)} = 258 \text{ m} $$

(b) For steel, Young's modulus is $$ Y = 2.10 \times 10^{11} \text{ N/m}^2 $$. The strain is:

$$ \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{P}{Y} = \frac{2.53 \times 10^{6} \text{ Pa}}{2.10 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}} = 1.20 \times 10^{-5} $$

For a capillary tube length of, say, $$ L = 10 \text{ cm} = 0.10 \text{ m} $$:

$$ \Delta L = (1.20 \times 10^{-5})(0.10 \text{ m}) = 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} = 1.2 \text{ μm} $$

A negative gauge pressure of 25.0 atm could raise water to a height of approximately **258 m**. A steel wire under the same tensile stress would stretch by a fractional amount of **1.2 × 10⁻⁵** (or about 1.2 μm for every 10 cm of length).

**Discussion**

The 258 m height is remarkable—far exceeding the ~10.3 m limit imposed by atmospheric pressure pushing water up into a vacuum. This demonstrates that water under tension (negative pressure) can "pull" rather than just "push." This is directly relevant to how trees transport water to heights exceeding 100 m. The cohesion-tension theory proposes that evaporation from leaves creates negative pressure that pulls water up through the xylem, with cohesive forces between water molecules preventing the water column from breaking. The comparison with steel shows that water under such tension behaves somewhat like a solid, though its cohesive strength is much less than steel's tensile strength.

The results are: (a) **2.01 × 10⁴ N**, (b) **1.17 × 10⁻³ m** (1.17 mm), and (c) **2.56 × 10¹⁰ Pa**.

The average force of **20,100 N** (about 4,500 pounds) is enormous—far exceeding the hammer's weight (4.9 N). This large force results from the rapid deceleration over a short distance (2.80 mm). The nail compresses by **1.17 mm**, about 2% of its 60-mm length, demonstrating steel's stiffness (high Young's modulus).

The pressure at the tip is **25.6 GPa** (about 250,000 atmospheres), which exceeds the yield strength of many materials, explaining why nails can penetrate wood. The small tip area concentrates the force, creating extreme pressure that locally deforms or shears the wood fibers. This is the same principle used in all cutting and penetrating tools—concentrate force on a small area to maximize pressure. The calculation assumes the force is uniform during impact, though in reality it varies; our value represents the average during the collision.

Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at the bottom of the Marianas Trench near the Philippines, given its depth is  $$11.0 \text{km} $$
 and assuming the density of sea water is constant all the way down. (b) Calculate the percent decrease in volume of sea water due to such a pressure, assuming its bulk modulus is the same as water and is constant. (c) What would be the percent increase in its density? Is the assumption of constant density valid? Will the actual pressure be greater or smaller than that calculated under this assumption?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

(a) Use $$ P = \rho g h $$ with seawater density.
(b) Use the bulk modulus relationship: $$ \frac{\Delta V}{V} = -\frac{P}{B} $$.
(c) Since mass is conserved, the density change relates to volume change, and we can assess whether the constant density assumption is valid.

**Solution**

(a) Using seawater density $$ \rho = 1025 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$ and depth $$ h = 11.0 \text{ km} = 11,000 \text{ m} $$:

$$ P = \rho g h = (1025 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(11,000 \text{ m}) = 1.10 \times 10^{8} \text{ Pa} $$

This equals about $$ \frac{1.10 \times 10^8}{1.013 \times 10^5} \approx 1090 \text{ atm} $$.

(b) The bulk modulus of water is $$ B = 2.2 \times 10^{9} \text{ Pa} $$. The fractional volume decrease is:

$$ \frac{\Delta V}{V} = -\frac{P}{B} = -\frac{1.10 \times 10^{8} \text{ Pa}}{2.2 \times 10^{9} \text{ Pa}} = -0.050 = -5.0\% $$

(c) Since mass is conserved and $$ \rho = m/V $$, a 5% decrease in volume means:

$$ \rho' = \frac{m}{V'} = \frac{m}{V(1-0.05)} = \frac{\rho}{0.95} \approx 1.053\rho $$

The percent increase in density is approximately **5.3%**.

The pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is approximately **1.10 × 10⁸ Pa** (~1090 atm). The volume decreases by about **5.0%**, and density increases by about **5.3%**. The constant density assumption is **not strictly valid** since the 5% compression is significant. Because the actual density at depth is higher than assumed, the **actual pressure would be greater** than calculated here—the compressed, denser water at the bottom is heavier than we assumed.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the limitations of assuming constant density for deep ocean calculations. A more accurate calculation would require integrating pressure over depth with varying density. The actual pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench (about 11,034 m at the Challenger Deep) is measured at approximately 1,086 atm, close to our estimate. The extreme pressure has significant biological implications—organisms living at these depths have evolved special adaptations to withstand pressures that would crush most surface-dwelling creatures.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use torque balance about the pivot point (top of arm) to find the force F from the slave cylinder.
(b) Use $$ P = F/A $$ with the slave cylinder's cross-sectional area.
(c) Use Pascal's principle to find the master cylinder force, then divide by the mechanical advantage of the lever.

**Solution:**

**(a) Force from slave cylinder:**

Calculate torques about the pivot (top of arm). Taking counterclockwise as positive:

Torque from load:
<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_{\text{load}} = -W_{\text{load}} \times r_{\text{load}} = -(400 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(1.70 \text{ m}) = -6664 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>

Torque from arm/shovel (note: acts perpendicular to arm, which is 30° from vertical):
<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_{\text{arm}} = -W_{\text{arm}} \times r_{\text{arm}} \cos(30°) = -(150 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(1.10 \text{ m}) \cos(30°) = -1405 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>

Torque from cylinder (acts perpendicular to arm):
<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_F = F \times r_F = F(0.30 \text{ m}) $$
</div>

For equilibrium: $$ \sum \tau = 0 $$
<div class="equation">
$$ F(0.30) = 6664 + 1405 = 8069 \text{ N·m} $$
$$ F = \frac{8069}{0.30} = 2.69 \times 10^{4} \text{ N} $$
</div>

Wait, let me recalculate. Looking at the figure more carefully, the arm makes a 30° angle. Let me use a simpler approach assuming the weights act vertically:

<div class="equation">
$$ F(0.30) = (400)(9.80)(1.70) + (150)(9.80)(1.10) $$
$$ F = \frac{6664 + 1617}{0.30} = \frac{8281}{0.30} \approx 1.38 \times 10^{4} \text{ N} $$
</div>

**(b) Pressure in hydraulic fluid:**

Slave cylinder area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A_{\text{slave}} = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.0125 \text{ m})^2 = 4.91 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ P = \frac{F}{A_{\text{slave}}} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{4} \text{ N}}{4.91 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2} = 2.81 \times 10^{7} \text{ Pa} $$
</div>

**(c) Force on master cylinder lever:**

Master cylinder area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A_{\text{master}} = \pi (0.00400 \text{ m})^2 = 5.03 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2 $$
</div>

Force on master cylinder (Pascal's principle: same pressure):
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{master}} = PA_{\text{master}} = (2.81 \times 10^{7} \text{ Pa})(5.03 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2) = 1414 \text{ N} $$
</div>

Force on lever with mechanical advantage 5.00:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{lever}} = \frac{F_{\text{master}}}{\text{MA}} = \frac{1414 \text{ N}}{5.00} = 283 \text{ N} $$
</div>

The results are: (a) **1.38 × 10⁴ N**, (b) **2.81 × 10⁷ Pa**, and (c) **283 N**.

**Discussion:**
The slave cylinder must exert **13,800 N** (about 3,100 pounds) to balance the torques. The hydraulic pressure of **28.1 MPa** (about 280 atmospheres or 4,070 psi) is typical for heavy equipment. Remarkably, an operator needs to apply only **283 N** (about 64 pounds) to the lever to generate this massive force. The system provides a total mechanical advantage of 13,800/283 ≈ 49, coming from both the hydraulic system (area ratio ≈ 9.8) and the lever (MA = 5.0). This demonstrates why hydraulic systems are ideal for heavy machinery—they allow precise control while multiplying force dramatically.

Some miners wish to remove water from a mine shaft. A pipe is lowered to the water 90 m below, and a negative pressure is applied to raise the water. (a) Calculate the pressure needed to raise the water. (b) What is unreasonable about this pressure? (c) What is unreasonable about the premise?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We calculate the pressure needed to support a 90 m column of water using $$ P = \rho g h $$, then compare this to atmospheric pressure to assess feasibility.

**Solution**

(a) The pressure needed to support a 90 m column of water:

$$ P = \rho g h = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)(90 \text{ m}) = 8.82 \times 10^{5} \text{ Pa} $$

Converting to atmospheres: $$ P = \frac{8.82 \times 10^5}{1.013 \times 10^5} = 8.71 \text{ atm} $$

The required gauge pressure (suction) would need to be approximately **8.82 × 10⁵ Pa** or about **8.7 atm below atmospheric pressure**.

(b) **What is unreasonable**: This pressure is impossible to achieve. A perfect vacuum can only create a maximum suction of 1 atmosphere (1.013 × 10⁵ Pa). The required suction of 8.7 atm is nearly 9 times greater than the maximum possible suction that can be created by removing all air from the pipe. Absolute negative pressures (below zero absolute) would require "pulling" on the water molecules themselves.

(c) **What is unreasonable about the premise**: The premise assumes that suction can raise water to any height, but atmospheric pressure can only push water up to a maximum height of about 10.3 m (the height of a water column supported by 1 atm pressure). Beyond this height, a vacuum forms at the top of the pipe and no additional water can be raised. For depths greater than 10.3 m, pumps must be placed at the bottom to push water up, rather than relying on suction from above.

**Discussion**

This is why deep wells require submersible pumps placed at the bottom rather than suction pumps at the surface. Historically, this limitation was discovered when attempting to pump water from deep mines, leading to important scientific investigations into the nature of atmospheric pressure and vacuum by Torricelli and others in the 17th century. The maximum suction lift of about 10 m is a fundamental limit that affects everything from drinking straws to industrial pumping systems.

(b) What is unreasonable about this (a) result? (c) Which premises are
unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use $$ F = PA $$ to calculate the required force.
(b) Compare the result to typical human capabilities.
(c) Analyze which given values are unrealistic.

**Solution:**

**(a) Required force:**

Calculate the piston area:
<div class="equation">
$$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.0200 \text{ m})^2 = 1.257 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2 $$
</div>

Calculate the force using $$ F = PA $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = PA = (6.90 \times 10^{5} \text{ Pa})(1.257 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2) = 867 \text{ N} $$
</div>

**(b) What is unreasonable:**

A force of **867 N** (about 195 pounds or 88 kg) is far too large to exert comfortably with a hand pump. Typical maximum force a person can exert on a bicycle pump is about 200-400 N (45-90 pounds). The calculated force is more than twice the upper limit and would require standing on the pump handle or using both hands with great effort.

**(c) Unreasonable premises:**

The assumed **radius of 2.00 cm** (diameter = 4.00 cm ≈ 1.6 inches) is unreasonably large for a bicycle pump piston. Typical hand pump pistons have diameters of 1.0-1.5 cm (0.4-0.6 inches), giving areas of 0.8-1.8 cm², which is about 6-16 times smaller than the given area.

With a more realistic radius of 0.60 cm (area = 1.13 × 10⁻⁴ m²), the force would be:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = (6.90 \times 10^{5} \text{ Pa})(1.13 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2) = 78 \text{ N} \approx 17 \text{ lb} $$
</div>

This is reasonable for pumping a high-pressure bicycle tire.

The **pressure of 6.90 × 10⁵ Pa** (about 100 psi or 6.8 atm) is actually reasonable for bicycle tires. Road bike tires typically use 80-130 psi, and mountain bike tires use 30-50 psi.

**Discussion:**
This problem illustrates the importance of checking whether calculated results make physical sense. The area $$ A = \pi r^2 $$ scales as the square of radius, so a piston twice as wide has four times the area and requires four times the force for the same pressure. Bicycle pump designers must balance the trade-off: larger pistons require less stroke length (fewer pumps) but more force per stroke, while smaller pistons require more pumps but less effort per pump. The typical design optimizes for human comfort and efficiency.

Consider a group of people trying to stay afloat after their boat strikes a log in a lake. Construct a problem in which you calculate the number of people that can cling to the log and keep their heads out of the water. Among the variables to be considered are the size and density of the log, and what is needed to keep a person's head and arms above water without swimming or treading water.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Constructed Problem**

A group of swimmers finds a floating log after their boat capsizes. The log is 3.0 m long with a radius of 0.20 m and has a density of 600 kg/m³. Each person has an average mass of 70 kg and needs a buoyant force equivalent to 15 kg (about 150 N) to keep their head and arms above water comfortably. How many people can cling to the log?

**Strategy**

We need to find the maximum buoyant force the log can provide to the people, which equals the weight of water displaced by the submerged portion of the log minus the weight of the log itself.

**Solution**

Calculate the log's volume:

$$ V_{\text{log}} = \pi r^2 L = \pi (0.20 \text{ m})^2 (3.0 \text{ m}) = 0.377 \text{ m}^3 $$

Calculate the log's mass:

$$ m_{\text{log}} = \rho_{\text{log}} V_{\text{log}} = (600 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.377 \text{ m}^3) = 226 \text{ kg} $$

If the log were completely submerged, the buoyant force would be:

$$ F_{\text{buoyant, max}} = \rho_{\text{water}} V_{\text{log}} g = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.377 \text{ m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 3690 \text{ N} $$

The net upward force available to support people (when log is fully submerged):

$$ F_{\text{available}} = F_{\text{buoyant, max}} - W_{\text{log}} = 3690 \text{ N} - (226 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 3690 - 2215 = 1475 \text{ N} $$

Each person needs 150 N of support. The number of people supported:

$$ n = \frac{1475 \text{ N}}{150 \text{ N/person}} = 9.8 \text{ people} $$

Approximately **9 people** can cling to the log and keep their heads above water.

**Discussion**

This calculation assumes the log becomes completely submerged when fully loaded. In reality, safety margins should be considered—with 9 people, the log would be at its limit and any waves or movement could cause it to submerge further. The low density of the log (typical of dry softwood) is crucial; a waterlogged log with density approaching 1000 kg/m³ would provide almost no support. This problem illustrates why knowing the buoyant properties of materials can be life-saving in emergency situations.

The alveoli in emphysema victims are damaged and effectively form larger sacs. Construct a problem in which you calculate the loss of pressure due to surface tension in the alveoli because of their larger average diameters. (Part of the lung's ability to expel air results from pressure created by surface tension in the alveoli.) Among the things to consider are the normal surface tension of the fluid lining the alveoli, the average alveolar radius in normal individuals and its average in emphysema sufferers.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Constructed Problem**

In healthy lungs, alveoli have an average radius of 0.10 mm and are lined with fluid having an effective surface tension of 0.050 N/m (due to surfactant). In an emphysema patient, damaged alveoli merge to form larger sacs with an average radius of 0.50 mm. Calculate the pressure in normal and emphysematous alveoli, and determine the percent reduction in the pressure available for passive exhalation.

**Strategy**

We use the gauge pressure equation for a spherical bubble: $$ P = \frac{4\gamma}{r} $$. By comparing pressures for normal and enlarged alveoli, we can quantify the loss of expiratory pressure.

**Solution**

For normal alveoli with $$ r_{\text{normal}} = 0.10 \text{ mm} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} $$:

$$ P_{\text{normal}} = \frac{4\gamma}{r} = \frac{4(0.050 \text{ N/m})}{1.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}} = 2000 \text{ Pa} $$

Converting to mm Hg: $$ P_{\text{normal}} = \frac{2000}{133} = 15.0 \text{ mm Hg} $$

For emphysematous alveoli with $$ r_{\text{emphysema}} = 0.50 \text{ mm} = 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} $$:

$$ P_{\text{emphysema}} = \frac{4\gamma}{r} = \frac{4(0.050 \text{ N/m})}{5.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}} = 400 \text{ Pa} $$

Converting to mm Hg: $$ P_{\text{emphysema}} = \frac{400}{133} = 3.0 \text{ mm Hg} $$

The percent reduction in pressure:

$$ \text{Percent reduction} = \frac{P_{\text{normal}} - P_{\text{emphysema}}}{P_{\text{normal}}} \times 100\% = \frac{2000 - 400}{2000} \times 100\% = 80\% $$

Normal alveoli produce approximately **15.0 mm Hg** (2000 Pa) of pressure for exhalation, while emphysematous alveoli produce only **3.0 mm Hg** (400 Pa)—an **80% reduction** in surface-tension-driven exhalation pressure.

**Discussion**

This dramatic reduction explains why emphysema patients have severe difficulty exhaling. Since $$ P \propto 1/r $$, when alveolar radius increases by a factor of 5, the pressure decreases by the same factor. Emphysema patients must use active muscle contraction to exhale—a process that is normally passive and effortless. The larger alveoli also reduce the total surface area available for gas exchange, compounding respiratory problems. This analysis helps explain why forced expiratory volume (FEV) tests are a key diagnostic tool for emphysema. The disease progression creates a vicious cycle: reduced exhalation means air trapping, which further distends and damages alveoli.
