### Electric Current

Electric current is defined to be the rate at which charge flows. A large
current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount of
charge in a small time, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a
hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge over a long period of time.
In equation form, **electric current**  $$I $$ is defined to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\Delta Q $$ is the amount of charge passing through a given area in time
$$\Delta t $$ .
(As in previous chapters, initial time is often taken to be zero, in which case
$$\Delta t=t $$ .)
(See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) The SI unit for current is the **ampere** (A),
named for the French physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). Since $$I=\Delta
Q/\Delta t $$ , we see that an ampere is one coulomb per second:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{A}=1 \text{C/s} $$
</div>

Not only are fuses and circuit breakers rated in amperes (or amps), so are many
electrical appliances.

![Charges are shown as small spheres moving through a section of a conducting wire. The direction of movement of charge is indicated by arrows along the length of the conductor toward the right. The cross-sectional area of the wire is labeled as A. The current is equal to the flow of charge.](../resources/Figure_20_01_01.jpg "The rate of flow of charge is current. An ampere is the flow of one coulomb through an area in one second.")

Calculating Currents: Current in a Truck Battery and a Handheld Calculator
</div>
(a) What is the current involved when a truck battery sets in motion 720 C of charge in 4.00 s while starting an engine? (b) How long does it take 1.00 C of charge to flow through a handheld calculator if a 0.300-mA current is flowing?

**Strategy**

We can use the definition of current in the equation $$I=\Delta Q/\Delta t $$ to
find the current in part (a), since charge and time are given. In part (b), we
rearrange the definition of current and use the given values of charge and
current to find the time required.

**Solution for (a)**

Entering the given values for charge and time into the definition of current
gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}I& =& \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{720 \text{C}}{4.00 \text{s}}=180 \text{C/s}\\ 
 I& =& 180 \text{A} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion for (a)**

This large value for current illustrates the fact that a large charge is moved
in a small amount of time. The currents in these “starter motors” are fairly
large because large frictional forces need to be overcome when setting something
in motion.

**Solution for (b)**

Solving the relationship $$I=\Delta Q/\Delta t $$ for time $$\Delta t $$ , and
entering the known values for charge and current gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta t& =& \frac{\Delta Q}{I}=\frac{1.00 \text{C}}{ 0.300 \times 10^{-3}  \text{C/s}}\\
\Delta t & =&  3.33 \times 10^{3}  \text{s} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion for (b)**

This time is slightly less than an hour. The small current used by the hand-held
calculator takes a much longer time to move a smaller charge than the large
current of the truck starter. So why can we operate our calculators only seconds
after turning them on? It’s because calculators require very little energy. Such
small current and energy demands allow handheld calculators to operate from
solar cells or to get many hours of use out of small batteries. Remember,
calculators do not have moving parts in the same way that a truck engine has
with cylinders and pistons, so the technology requires smaller currents.

</div>

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a simple circuit and the standard schematic
representation of a battery, conducting path, and load (a resistor). Schematics
are very useful in visualizing the main features of a circuit. A single
schematic can represent a wide variety of situations. The schematic
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) (b), for example, can represent anything from a truck
battery connected to a headlight lighting the street in front of the truck to a
small battery connected to a penlight lighting a keyhole in a door. Such
schematics are useful because the analysis is the same for a wide variety of
situations. We need to understand a few schematics to apply the concepts and
analysis to many more situations.

The schematic represents a wide variety of similar circuits.")
{: #Figure2}

Note that the direction of current flow in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) is from
positive to negative. **The direction of conventional current is the direction
that positive charge would flow**. Depending on the situation, positive charges,
negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, for example, current is
carried by electrons—that is, negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as
salt water, both positive and negative charges move. This is also true in nerve
cells. A Van de Graaff generator used for nuclear research can produce a current
of pure positive charges, such as protons. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) illustrates
the movement of charged particles that compose a current. The fact that
conventional current is taken to be in the direction that positive charge would
flow can be traced back to American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin
in the 1700s. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative,
long before they were known to carry current in so many situations. Franklin, in
fact, was totally unaware of the small-scale structure of electricity.

It is important to realize that there is an electric field in conductors
responsible for producing the current, as illustrated in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).
Unlike static electricity, where a conductor in equilibrium cannot have an
electric field in it, conductors carrying a current have an electric field and
are not in static equilibrium. An electric field is needed to supply energy to
move the charges.

Calculating the Number of Electrons that Move through a Calculator
</div>
If the 0.300-mA current through the calculator mentioned in the [[Example 1]](#Example1) example is carried by electrons, how many electrons per second pass through it?

**Strategy**

The current calculated in the previous example was defined for the flow of
positive charge. For electrons, the magnitude is the same, but the sign is
opposite, $${I}_{\text{electrons}}=-0.300 \times 10^{-3 }\text{C/s} $$. Since
each electron $$\left({e}^{-}\right) $$ has a charge of $$ - 1.60 \times
10^{-19} \text{C} $$ , we can convert the current in coulombs per second to
electrons per second.

**Solution**

Starting with the definition of current, we have

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{\text{electrons}}=\frac{\Delta {Q}_{\text{electrons}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{ - 0.300 \times 10^{-3}  \text{C}}{\text{s}}\text{.} $$
</div>
We divide this by the charge per electron, so that

<div class="equation" >
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\frac{ {e}^{-}}{\text{s}}
& =& \frac{ - 0.300 \times 10^{-3} \text{C}}{\text{s}}\times \frac{1 {e}^{-}}{-1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}}\\ 
& =&  1.88 \times 10^{15}  \frac{ {e}^{-}}{\text{s}} \text{.}
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

There are so many charged particles moving, even in small currents, that
individual charges are not noticed, just as individual water molecules are not
noticed in water flow. Even more amazing is that they do not always keep moving
forward like soldiers in a parade. Rather they are like a crowd of people with
movement in different directions but a general trend to move forward. There are
lots of collisions with atoms in the metal wire and, of course, with other
electrons.

</div>

### Drift Velocity

Electrical signals are known to move very rapidly. Telephone conversations
carried by currents in wires cover large distances without noticeable delays.
Lights come on as soon as a switch is flicked. Most electrical signals carried
by currents travel at speeds on the order of $$10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ , a
significant fraction of the speed of light. Interestingly, the individual
charges that make up the current move **much** more slowly on average, typically
drifting at speeds on the order of $$10^{-4} \text{m/s} $$ . How do we reconcile
these two speeds, and what does it tell us about standard conductors?

The high speed of electrical signals results from the fact that the force
between charges acts rapidly at a distance. Thus, when a free charge is forced
into a wire, as in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), the incoming charge pushes other
charges ahead of it, which in turn push on charges farther down the line. The
density of charge in a system cannot easily be increased, and so the signal is
passed on rapidly. The resulting electrical shock wave moves through the system
at nearly the speed of light. To be precise, this rapidly moving signal or shock
wave is a rapidly propagating change in electric field.

![Negatively charged electrons move through a conducting wire. Two electrons are shown entering the wire from one end, and two electrons are shown leaving the wire at the other end. The direction of movement of charge is indicated by arrows along the length of the wire toward the right. Some electrons are shown inside the wire.](../resources/Figure_20_01_04.jpg "When charged particles are forced into this volume of a conductor, an equal number are quickly forced to leave. The repulsion between like charges makes it difficult to increase the number of charges in a volume. Thus, as one charge enters, another leaves almost immediately, carrying the signal rapidly forward.")
{: #Figure4}

Good conductors have large numbers of free charges in them. In metals, the free
charges are free electrons. [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows how free electrons move
through an ordinary conductor. The distance that an individual electron can move
between collisions with atoms or other electrons is quite small. The electron
paths thus appear nearly random, like the motion of atoms in a gas. But there is
an electric field in the conductor that causes the electrons to drift in the
direction shown (opposite to the field, since they are negative). The **drift
velocity**  $${v}_{\text{d}} $$ is the average velocity of the free charges.
Drift velocity is quite small, since there are so many free charges. If we have
an estimate of the density of free electrons in a conductor, we can calculate
the drift velocity for a given current. The larger the density, the lower the
velocity required for a given current.

![The diagram shows a section of a conducting wire. A free electron is shown in the wire, and the path of the electron is shown as zigzag arrows along the length of the wire. The path is shown beginning at one end of the wire and ending at the other end. The drift velocity, v sub d, is indicated by an arrow toward the right, opposite the direction of the electric field E and the current I.](../resources/Figure_20_01_05.jpg "Free electrons moving in a conductor make many collisions with other electrons and atoms. The path of one electron is shown. The average velocity of the free charges is called the drift velocity, \( v_{d} \), and it is in the direction opposite to the electric field for electrons. The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, requiring a constant supply of energy to maintain a steady current.")
{: #Figure5}

<div class="title">
Conduction of Electricity and Heat
</div>
Good electrical conductors are often good heat conductors, too. This is because large numbers of free electrons can carry electrical current and can transport thermal energy.

</div>

The free-electron collisions transfer energy to the atoms of the conductor. The
electric field does work in moving the electrons through a distance, but that
work does not increase the kinetic energy (nor speed, therefore) of the
electrons. The work is transferred to the conductor’s atoms, possibly increasing
temperature. Thus a continuous power input is required to keep a current
flowing. An exception, of course, is found in superconductors, for reasons we
shall explore in a later chapter. Superconductors can have a steady current
without a continual supply of energy—a great energy savings. In contrast, the
supply of energy can be useful, such as in a lightbulb filament. The supply of
energy is necessary to increase the temperature of the tungsten filament, so
that the filament glows.

</div>

We can obtain an expression for the relationship between current and drift
velocity by considering the number of free charges in a segment of wire, as
illustrated in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6). **The number of free charges per unit
volume** is given the symbol $$n $$ and depends on the material. The shaded
segment has a volume $$A x $$ , so that the number of free charges in it is 
$$ nAx $$ . The charge $$\Delta Q $$ in this segment is thus $$qnAx $$ ,
where $$q $$ is the amount of charge on each carrier. (Recall that for
electrons, $$q $$ is $$ -1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C} $$ .)
Current is charge moved per unit time; thus, if all the original charges move
out of this segment in time $$\Delta t $$ , the current is

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{qnAx}{\Delta t} . $$
</div>

Note that $$x/\Delta t $$ is the magnitude of the drift velocity, $${v}_
{\text{d}} $$ , since the charges move an average distance $$x $$ in a time
$$\Delta t $$. Rearranging terms gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=nqAv_{\text{d}}, $$
</div>

where $$I $$ is the current through a wire of cross-sectional area $$A $$ made
of a material with a free charge density $$n $$ . The carriers of the current
each have charge $$q $$ and move with a drift velocity of magnitude $${v}_
{\text{d}} $$.

![Charges are shown moving through a section of a conducting wire. The charges have a drift velocity v sub d along the length of the wire, shown by an arrow pointing to the right. The volume of a segment of the wire is equal to A times x, where x equals the product of the drift velocity, v sub d, and time t. A cross section of the wire is marked as A, and the length of the section is x.](../resources/Figure_20_01_06.jpg "All the charges in the shaded volume of this wire move out in a time \( t \) , having a drift velocity of magnitude \( v_\text{d}=x/t \) . See text for further discussion.")
{: #Figure6}

Note that simple drift velocity is not the entire story. The speed of an
electron is much greater than its drift velocity. In addition, not all of the
electrons in a conductor can move freely, and those that do might move somewhat
faster or slower than the drift velocity. So what do we mean by free electrons?
Atoms in a metallic conductor are packed in the form of a lattice structure.
Some electrons are far enough away from the atomic nuclei that they do not
experience the attraction of the nuclei as much as the inner electrons do. These
are the free electrons. They are not bound to a single atom but can instead move
freely among the atoms in a “sea” of electrons. These free electrons respond by
accelerating when an electric field is applied. Of course as they move they
collide with the atoms in the lattice and other electrons, generating thermal
energy, and the conductor gets warmer. In an insulator, the organization of the
atoms and the structure do not allow for such free electrons.

<div class="title">
Calculating Drift Velocity in a Common Wire
</div>
Calculate the drift velocity of electrons in a 12-gauge copper wire (which has a diameter of 2.053 mm) carrying a 20.0-A current, given that there is one free electron per copper atom. (Household wiring often contains 12-gauge copper wire, and the maximum current allowed in such wire is usually 20 A.) The density of copper is  $$ 8.80 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$.

**Strategy**

We can calculate the drift velocity using the equation $$I= n q A v_d $$ . The
current $$I=20.0 \text{A} $$ is given, and $$q= -1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}
$$ is the charge of an electron. We can calculate the area of a cross-section of
the wire using the formula $$A=\pi {r}^{2}, $$ where $$r $$ is one-half the
given diameter, 2.053 mm. We are given the density of copper, $$8.80 \times
10^{3} {\text{kg/m}}^{3}, $$ and the periodic table shows that the atomic mass
of copper is 63.54 g/mol. We can use these two quantities along with Avogadro’s
number, $$6.02 \times 10^{23} \text{atoms/mol}, $$ to determine $$n, $$ the
number of free electrons per cubic meter.

**Solution**

First, calculate the density of free electrons in copper. There is one free
electron per copper atom. Therefore, is the same as the number of copper atoms
per $$\text{m}^{3} $$ . We can now find $$n $$ as follows:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}n& =& \frac{1 {e}^{-}}{\text{atom}}×\frac{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  \text{atoms}}{\text{mol}}×\frac{1 mol}{63.54 \text{g}}×\frac{1000 \text{g}}{\text{kg}}×\frac{ 8.80 \times 10^{3}  \text{kg}}{ {1 \text{m}}^{3}}\\ 
  n & =&  8.342  \times 10^{28} {e}^{-}{\text{/m}}^{3}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
The cross-sectional area of the wire is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}A& =& \pi {r}^{2}\\ 
 A& =& \pi {\left(\frac{ 2.053 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}}{2}\right)}^{2}\\ 
 A& =& 3.310 \times 10^{-6} {\text{m}}^{2}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
Rearranging  $$I=nqA{v}_{\text{d}} $$  to isolate drift velocity gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}
 {v}_{\text{d}}&=&\frac{I}{nqA}\\ 
{v}_{\text{d}}&=&\frac{20.0 \text{A}}{\left( 8.342 \times 10^{28} {\text{/m}}^{3}\right)\left(-1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left( 3.310 \times 10^{-6} {\text{m}}^{2}\right)}\\ 
{v}_{\text{d}} &=&-4.53 \times 10^{-4} \text{m/s} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The minus sign indicates that the negative charges are moving in the direction
opposite to conventional current. The small value for drift velocity (on the
order of $$10^{-4} \text{m/s} $$ )
confirms that the signal moves on the order of $$ 10^{12} $$ times faster (about
$$10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ )
than the charges that carry it.

What is the current in milliamperes produced by the solar cells of a pocket calculator through which 4.00 C of charge passes in 4.00 h?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use the definition of current $$I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$$ to find the current. We need to convert time from hours to seconds for proper SI units.

**Solution**

First, convert time to seconds:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = 4.00 \text{ h} \times \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ h}} = 1.44 \times 10^{4} \text{ s}$$
</div>

Now apply the definition of current:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{4.00 \text{ C}}{1.44 \times 10^{4} \text{ s}} = 2.78 \times 10^{-4} \text{ A} = 0.278 \text{ mA}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This small current is typical of low-power electronic devices like calculators. The solar cells provide just enough current to operate the calculator's circuits, which require very little power. This demonstrates why calculators can run for extended periods on minimal energy input.

The current produced by the solar cells is 0.278 mA.

A total of 600 C of charge passes through a flashlight in 0.500 h. What is the average current?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply the definition of current $$I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$$ directly. The time must be converted from hours to seconds.

**Solution**

Convert time to seconds:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = 0.500 \text{ h} \times \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ h}} = 1800 \text{ s}$$
</div>

Calculate the current:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{600 \text{ C}}{1800 \text{ s}} = 0.333 \text{ A} = 333 \text{ mA}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This current of 0.333 A (or 333 mA) is much larger than the calculator current in the previous problem, which makes sense because a flashlight bulb requires considerably more power to produce light. Flashlight batteries must provide substantial current, which is why they drain relatively quickly during use.

**Strategy**

We use $$I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$$ with the given charge and time values. Both quantities need to be converted to SI base units.

**Solution**

Convert the charge and time to SI units:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta Q = 0.250 \text{ μC} = 0.250 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = 1.00 \text{ μs} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$$

Calculate the current:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.250 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}}{1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}} = 0.250 \text{ A}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Despite the tiny amount of charge involved, the extremely short discharge time results in a significant current of 0.250 A—comparable to the current through a small lightbulb. This explains why static shocks can be felt: the momentary current is substantial enough to stimulate nerve endings. The brief duration prevents any harmful effects.

Convert units:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = 0.500 \text{ μs} = 0.500 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s} = 5.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ s}$$

This current of 4.00 mA is below the threshold of sensation (about 1 mA for perception, 5 mA for harmless shocks), which is why small static discharges from combing hair often go unnoticed. The charge transferred is much smaller than in the doorknob example, and the resulting current, while brief, is correspondingly lower.

The current during the comb discharge is 4.00 mA.

A large lightning bolt had a 20 000-A current and moved 30.0 C of charge. What was its duration?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Rearrange the definition of current $$I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$$ to solve for time: $$\Delta t = \Delta Q / I$$.

**Solution**

Rearranging $$I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$$ for time:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta Q}{I} = \frac{30.0 \text{ C}}{20\,000 \text{ A}} = \frac{30.0 \text{ C}}{2.00 \times 10^{4} \text{ A}} = 1.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s} = 1.50 \text{ ms}$$

**Discussion**

Lightning bolts transfer enormous amounts of charge (30 C here compared to microcoulombs in static shocks) in extremely short times. The 1.50 ms duration seems brief, but this is actually relatively long for lightning—the massive current and charge transfer can cause significant damage, vaporizing materials and starting fires. The energy involved (power times time) is substantial despite the short duration because the current is so high.

The 200-A current through a spark plug moves 0.300 mC of charge. How long does the spark last?

Use the rearranged current equation $$\Delta t = \Delta Q / I$$ to find the duration. Convert milliCoulombs to Coulombs first.

**Solution**

Convert charge to SI units:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta Q = 0.300 \text{ mC} = 0.300 \times 10^{-3} \text{ C} = 3.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ C}$$

**Discussion**

The spark plug discharge lasts only 1.50 μs—a thousand times shorter than the lightning bolt, despite having a similar current magnitude of hundreds of amperes. The much smaller charge transferred means much less energy is involved, which is appropriate for reliably igniting fuel in an engine cylinder thousands of times per minute. This extremely brief, high-current pulse is precisely timed to ignite the fuel-air mixture at the optimal moment.

(a) A defibrillator sends a 6.00-A current through the chest of a patient by applying a 10 000-V potential as in the figure below. What is the resistance of the path? (b) The defibrillator paddles make contact with the patient through a conducting gel that greatly reduces the path resistance. Discuss the difficulties that would ensue if a larger voltage were used to produce the same current through the patient, but with the path having perhaps 50 times the resistance.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

(a) Use Ohm's law $$V = IR$$ rearranged to solve for resistance: $$R = V/I$$.

(b) Analyze the power implications using $$P = I^2 R$$ when resistance increases while maintaining constant current.

**Solution for (a)**

Applying Ohm's law to find resistance:

<div class="equation">
$$R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{10\,000 \text{ V}}{6.00 \text{ A}} = 1670 \text{ Ω} = 1.67 \text{ kΩ}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

If resistance increases by a factor of 50 while current remains constant at 6.00 A:

<div class="equation">
$$R_{\text{new}} = 50 \times 1.67 \text{ kΩ} = 83.5 \text{ kΩ}$$
</div>

The power dissipated would be:

<div class="equation">
$$P = I^2 R = (6.00 \text{ A})^2 \times (83\,500 \text{ Ω}) = 3.01 \times 10^6 \text{ W} = 3.01 \text{ MW}$$
</div>

Compared to the original power: $$P_{\text{original}} = I^2 R = (6.00)^2 \times 1670 = 60.1 \text{ kW}$$

**Discussion**

(a) The resistance of 1.67 kΩ is consistent with the resistance through a human torso when good electrical contact is made using conducting gel.

(b) Increasing resistance 50-fold while maintaining the same current would increase power dissipation by a factor of 50 (since $$P = I^2 R$$). This would cause catastrophic burns to the patient's skin and underlying tissue. The conducting gel serves the critical function of reducing contact resistance, allowing the necessary current to flow while minimizing harmful heating effects. Without the gel, the high contact resistance would require dangerous voltage levels and cause severe thermal damage.

The resistance of the path through the patient is 1.67 kΩ.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Apply Ohm's law directly: $$V = IR$$. The current must be converted from milliamperes to amperes.

**Solution**

Convert current to SI units:

$$V = IR = (0.0100 \text{ A})(500 \text{ Ω}) = 5.00 \text{ V}$$

**Discussion**

This surprisingly low voltage of only 5.00 V is sufficient because the defibrillator is applied directly to the exposed heart during open-heart surgery. With the skin barrier bypassed, the patient is "microshock sensitive," meaning much smaller currents (and thus voltages) can affect the heart. Compare this 10.0-mA current to the 6.00 A used with external defibrillator paddles—the direct application requires about 600 times less current because the resistance path is much shorter and doesn't include skin resistance.

It takes only about 1.5 minutes to move a mole of electrons at this high current!

The doubly-charged helium nuclei (alpha particles) contribute twice the charge per particle compared to electrons, resulting in half as many particles needed per unit current.

The drift velocity in silver ($$-6.45 \times 10^{-4}$$ m/s) is larger in magnitude than in copper ($$-4.53 \times 10^{-4}$$ m/s) for the same current because silver has a lower free electron density. Since $$v_d = I/(nqA)$$, a smaller $$n$$ requires a larger drift velocity to maintain the same current. Despite being a better conductor (lower resistivity), silver has fewer free electrons per unit volume than copper.

Doubling the diameter quadruples the cross-sectional area (since $$A = \pi r^2 \propto d^2$$). Use the drift velocity equation $$v_d = I/(nqA)$$ with the same current and electron density as Example 3.

**Solution**

The original wire has diameter 2.053 mm, so the new diameter is:

$$d_{\text{new}} = 2 \times 2.053 \text{ mm} = 4.106 \text{ mm}$$

**Discussion**

The drift velocity is exactly 1/4 of the original value ($$-4.53 \times 10^{-4}$$ m/s ÷ 4 = $$-1.13 \times 10^{-4}$$ m/s), as expected since quadrupling the area while keeping current constant reduces drift velocity proportionally.

A drift velocity of 1.00 mm/s is actually quite fast for electrons in a wire—more than twice the drift velocity in Example 3. The resulting current of 27.8 A exceeds the typical 15-A rating for 14-gauge wire in household circuits.

The time for one orbit is $$T = \text{circumference}/v = \pi d/c$$. The total charge in the beam is $$Q = IT$$, and dividing by the electron charge gives the number of electrons.

**Solution**

Calculate the circumference of the storage ring:

<div class="equation">
$$C = \pi d = \pi (72.0 \text{ m}) = 226.2 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the time for one orbit at nearly the speed of light ($$c = 3.00 \times 10^{8}$$ m/s):

<div class="equation">
$$T = \frac{C}{c} = \frac{226.2 \text{ m}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 7.54 \times 10^{-7} \text{ s}$$
</div>

The total charge in the beam equals current times orbital period:

<div class="equation">
$$Q = IT = (20.0 \text{ A})(7.54 \times 10^{-7} \text{ s}) = 1.508 \times 10^{-5} \text{ C}$$
</div>

The number of electrons:

<div class="equation">
$$N = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{1.508 \times 10^{-5} \text{ C}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C/electron}} = 9.42 \times 10^{13} \text{ electrons}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The beam contains about 94 trillion electrons—a large number, but still only about $$1.6 \times 10^{-10}$$ moles, far too small to weigh. Despite the high current of 20 A, each electron passes any given point many times per second (about 1.3 million orbits per second), so relatively few electrons are needed to maintain this current. The electrons travel at nearly the speed of light, making many complete circuits each second, which is why a modest number of particles can produce such a large current.

The SPEAR storage ring contains approximately $$9.42 \times 10^{13}$$ electrons.
