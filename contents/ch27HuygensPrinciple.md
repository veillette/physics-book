[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows how a transverse wave looks as viewed from above
and from the side. A light wave can be imagined to propagate like this, although
we do not actually see it wiggling through space. From above, we view the
wavefronts (or wave crests) as we would by looking down on the ocean waves. The
side view would be a graph of the electric or magnetic field. The view from
above is perhaps the most useful in developing concepts about wave optics.

![The figure contains three images. The first image, labeled view from above, represents a wave viewed from above as a series of thin, straight strips arranged adjacent to each other across the page. The color of the strips changes gradually from a darker blue near the crests of the waves to white near the troughs of the waves. A single black horizontal arrow points from left to right across the image. The second image, labeled view from side, shows a typical sine curve oscillating above and below a black arrow pointing to the right that serves as the horizontal axis. The sine wave has the same wavelength as the wave viewed from above. The third image, labeled overall view, is a perspective view of a wave of the same wavelength as in the first two images.](../resources/Figure_27_02_01.jpg 'A transverse wave, such as an electromagnetic wave like light, as viewed from above and from the side. The direction of propagation is perpendicular to the wavefronts (or wave crests) and is represented by an arrow like a ray.')

The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) developed a useful technique
for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. Starting from some
known position, **Huygens’s principle** states that:

**Every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the
forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a
line tangent to all of the wavelets.**

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows how Huygens’s principle is applied. A wavefront is
the long edge that moves, for example, the crest or the trough. Each point on
the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed $$v $$ . These are drawn at a time $$t $$ later, so that they have moved a distance
$$s=vt $$ . The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where we
would expect the wave to be a time $$t $$ later. Huygens’s principle works for
all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. We will
find it useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in
explaining the laws of reflection and refraction. In addition, we will see that
Huygens’s principle tells us how and where light rays interfere.

![This figure shows two straight vertical lines, with the left line labeled old wavefront and the right line labeled new wavefront. In the center of the image, a horizontal black arrow crosses both lines and points to the right. The old wavefront line passes through eight evenly spaced dots, with four dots above the black arrow and four dots below the black arrow. Each dot serves as the center of a corresponding semicircle, and all eight semicircles are the same size. The point on each semicircle that is on the same horizontal level as the corresponding center dot touches the new wavefront line, as if the semicircles are pushing the new wavefront line away from the old wavefront line. One of the center dots has a radial arrow pointing to a point on the corresponding semicircle. This radial arrow is labeled s equals v t.](../resources/Figure_27_02_02.jpg 'Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wavelet that moves a distance ( s = v t ). The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets.')
{: #Figure2}

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows how a mirror reflects an incoming wave at an angle
equal to the incident angle, verifying the law of reflection. As the wavefront
strikes the mirror, wavelets are first emitted from the left part of the mirror
and then the right. The wavelets closer to the left have had time to travel
farther, producing a wavefront traveling in the direction shown.

![The figure shows a grid pattern made of dots. The overall grid pattern would be square were its upper-right four dots not cut off by a gray solid rectangle oriented at forty five degrees counterclockwise from the vertical. Semicircles representing wavelets are centered on each dot. Arrows indicate that the wavelets approach the angled surface from the left and then reflect downward.](../resources/Figure_27_02_03.jpg 'Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront striking a mirror. The wavelets shown were emitted as each point on the wavefront struck the mirror. The tangent to these wavelets shows that the new wavefront has been reflected at an angle equal to the incident angle. The direction of propagation is perpendicular to the wavefront, as shown by the downward-pointing arrows.')
{: #Figure3}

The law of refraction can be explained by applying Huygens’s principle to a
wavefront passing from one medium to another (see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). Each
wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wavefront crossed the interface
between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the
waves do not travel as far in a given time, and the new wavefront changes
direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes direction to become closer
to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell’s law can be derived from the
geometry in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), but this is left as an exercise for
ambitious readers.

![The figure shows two media separated by a horizontal line labeled surface. The upper medium is labeled medium one and the lower medium is labeled medium two. A vertical dotted line cuts through both media and is perpendicular to the surface. The point where the dotted line crosses the surface between the media will be called the point of contact. In medium one, a ray pointing down and to the right makes an abrupt turn at the point of contact. The path of the ray makes an angle theta sub one with the dotted line in medium one. In medium two, the ray leaves the point of contact and follows a path that makes an angle theta sub two with the dotted line in medium two, where theta sub two is less than theta sub one. We will call these the incident ray and the refracted ray, respectively. Thus, the refracted ray is closer to being vertical than the incident ray. Three line segments, labeled wavefront, are drawn perpendicular to the incident ray and the refracted ray. These line segments are equally spaced for both rays, but the three line segments that cross the incident ray are shorter and more widely spaced than the three line segments that cross the refracted ray. The separation of these line segments is labeled v sub one t for the incident ray and v sub two t for the refracted ray, with v sub two t being less than v sub one t.](../resources/Figure_27_02_04.jpg 'Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront traveling from one medium to another where its speed is less. The ray bends toward the perpendicular, since the wavelets have a lower speed in the second medium.')

What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining
through an open door into a dark room? For light, we expect to see a sharp
shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and we expect no light to bend
around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door,
we expect to hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, expect that sound spreads
out when passing through such an opening (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)). What is
the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case?
The answer is that light has very short wavelengths and acts like a ray. Sound
has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door and bends around corners (
for frequency of 1000 Hz, $$\lambda =c/f=\left(330 \text{m}/\text{s}\right) /\left(1000 {\text{s}}^{-1}\right)=0.33 \text{m} $$ , about three times smaller
than the width of the doorway).

![Part a of the figure is a view from above of a diagram of a wall in which is cut an open door. The wall extends from the bottom of the diagram to the top, and the door forms a gap in the wall. The door itself is opened to the left and is positioned about forty five degrees from the wall on which it pivots. From the left comes a bright light, which is labeled small lambda, and the door and wall create sharp shadows by blocking this light. The edges of these shadows are labeled straight-edge shadows. Some of the light passes through the open doorway. Part b of the figure shows a similar diagram. A line parallel to the wall approaches the wall from the left and is labeled plane wavefront of sound. There are five dots evenly spaced across the open doorway, labeled one through five. Semicircles appear to the right of these dots entering the room to the right of the wall. Bracketing all these semicircles is a line that has the form of closing square bracket with rounded corners. This line is labeled sound. There are five rays shown pointing from the bracketing line into the room to the right of the wall. Three of these rays point horizontally to the right, one ray points upward and to the right, and the last ray points downward and to the right. This last ray points to the ear of a person who we see from above and who is labeled listener. The diagram indicates that the listener hears sound around the corner of the door.](../resources/Figure_27_02_05.jpg '(a) Light passing through a doorway makes a sharp outline on the floor. Since light’s wavelength is very small compared with the size of the door, it acts like a ray. (b) Sound waves bend into all parts of the room, a wave effect, because their wavelength is similar to the size of the door.')
{: #Figure5}

If we pass light through smaller openings, often called slits, we can use
Huygens’s principle to see that light bends as sound does (
see [[Figure 6]](#Figure6)). The bending of a wave around the edges of an
opening or an obstacle is called **diffraction**. Diffraction is a wave
characteristic and occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for
some phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is a wave. Thus the
horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits
in [[Figure 1]](../contents/ch27WaveAspectOfLight#Figure1) is evidence that light is a
wave.

![Three related diagrams showing how waves spread out when passing through various-size openings. The first diagram shows wavefronts passing through an opening that is wide compared to the distance between successive wavefronts. The wavefronts that emerge on the other side of the opening have minor bending along the edges. The second diagram shows wavefronts passing through a smaller opening. The waves experience more bending. The third diagram shows wavefronts passing through an opening that has a size similar to the spacing between wavefronts. These waves show significant bending.](../resources/Figure_27_02_06.jpg 'Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront striking an opening. The edges of the wavefront bend after passing through the opening, a process called diffraction. The amount of bending is more extreme for a small opening, consistent with the fact that wave characteristics are most noticeable for interactions with objects about the same size as the wavelength.')

### Section Summary

- An accurate technique for determining how and where waves propagate is given
  by Huygens’s principle: Every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets
  that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself.
  The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets.
- Diffraction is the bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or other
  obstacle.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
How do wave effects depend on the size of the object with which the wave interacts? For example, why does sound bend around the corner of a building while light does not?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Wave effects such as diffraction and interference become most pronounced when the wavelength of the wave is comparable to the size of the object or opening with which it interacts. We need to compare the wavelengths of sound and light to typical building dimensions.

**Solution**

Wave effects are most noticeable when the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the size of the object with which the wave interacts. Sound waves have wavelengths on the order of meters (for a 1000 Hz sound in air, λ = v/f = 343 m/s / 1000 Hz ≈ 0.34 m). This wavelength is comparable to the width of a doorway or the corner of a building, so significant diffraction occurs, causing sound to bend around corners.

In contrast, visible light has wavelengths in the range of 380-760 nm (about 10⁻⁷ m), which is millions of times smaller than typical building dimensions. When light encounters objects much larger than its wavelength, it behaves more like a ray traveling in straight lines, with minimal diffraction. The edges of shadows do show some diffraction effects, but these are very small compared to the overall size of the shadow.

**Discussion**

This principle explains why we can hear someone talking around a corner but cannot see them. It also explains why larger obstacles are needed to observe diffraction effects with light - for example, narrow slits with widths on the order of micrometers are required to see significant diffraction patterns with visible light. The general rule is: diffraction effects are most noticeable when λ ≈ d, where d is the size of the obstacle or opening.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Under what conditions can light be modeled like a ray? Like a wave?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The choice between ray and wave models depends on the relative size of wavelength compared to the objects and apertures involved in the situation.

**Solution**

Light can be modeled as a **ray** when it interacts with objects that are much larger than its wavelength (λ << d). Under these conditions:
- Diffraction effects are negligible
- Light travels in straight lines
- Reflection and refraction can be accurately described using geometric optics
- Examples: mirrors, lenses in cameras and eyeglasses, optical instruments where apertures are millimeters or larger

Light must be modeled as a **wave** when:
- It interacts with objects or openings comparable to or smaller than its wavelength (λ ≈ d or λ > d)
- Diffraction, interference, or polarization effects are important
- Precise measurements of wavelength or small-scale phenomena are involved
- Examples: diffraction gratings, double-slit experiments, thin film interference, resolution limits of microscopes and telescopes

The transition between these models is gradual. For objects with dimensions around 1-100 wavelengths, both wave and ray effects may be observable, and a complete analysis requires wave optics.

**Discussion**

This dual nature reflects the wave-particle duality of light. The ray model (geometric optics) is simpler and adequate for many practical applications involving macroscopic optical devices. However, the wave model is fundamental and necessary for understanding the true nature of light and phenomena that the ray model cannot explain. In modern physics, we recognize that light always has wave properties, but these become negligible in certain macroscopic situations where the ray approximation works well.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Go outside in the sunlight and observe your shadow. It has fuzzy edges even if you do not. Is this a diffraction effect? Explain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to consider what causes fuzzy shadow edges and determine whether diffraction or other effects are responsible.

**Solution**

The fuzzy edges of shadows outdoors are **primarily NOT due to diffraction**, but rather to the fact that the Sun is an extended light source rather than a point source.

The Sun subtends an angle of about 0.5° as seen from Earth. When you stand in sunlight, different parts of the Sun's disk illuminate your body from slightly different angles. This creates three regions:
- **Umbra**: The fully shadowed region where no part of the Sun is visible
- **Penumbra**: The partially shadowed region where only part of the Sun is visible
- **Fully lit region**: Where the entire Sun is visible

The fuzzy edge of your shadow is the penumbra, where the illumination gradually transitions from full shadow to full sunlight.

There IS a small diffraction effect at the edges of shadows, but it is extremely small compared to the penumbral effect. Diffraction fringes from visible light would only extend a fraction of a millimeter from the shadow edge, far too small to be noticed under normal outdoor conditions. The diffraction effect would be noticeable only if:
- You used a true point source of light (like a distant streetlamp at night)
- You observed very carefully, possibly with magnification
- Your shadow fell on a screen at a considerable distance

**Discussion**

You can test this by using different light sources. With a small, distant light source (like a streetlamp far away at night), your shadow edges will be much sharper, though still showing tiny diffraction fringes if examined carefully. With a large, nearby light source (like a lamp with a large bulb), your shadow edges will be very fuzzy. This confirms that the extended nature of the source, not diffraction, dominates the fuzzy-edge effect in everyday shadows.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Why does the wavelength of light decrease when it passes from vacuum into a medium? State which attributes change and which stay the same and, thus, require the wavelength to decrease.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to apply the wave equation v = fλ and identify which quantities change and which remain constant when light enters a medium.

**Solution**

When light passes from vacuum into a medium:

**What stays the SAME:**
- **Frequency (f)**: The frequency of the light wave is determined by the source and does not change when light enters a medium. This must be true for continuity - if the frequency changed at the boundary, there would be a buildup or deficit of wave crests at the interface, which is physically impossible.

**What CHANGES:**
- **Speed (v)**: Light slows down in a medium. In vacuum, v = c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s. In a medium with index of refraction n, the speed becomes v = c/n, which is less than c.

**Why wavelength MUST decrease:**
From the wave equation:
<div class="equation">
$$v = f\lambda$$
</div>

Since frequency f remains constant and speed v decreases, the wavelength λ must also decrease to maintain the relationship:

<div class="equation">
$$\lambda_{\text{medium}} = \frac{v_{\text{medium}}}{f} = \frac{c/n}{f} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{vacuum}}}{n}$$
</div>

Therefore, λ_medium = λ_vacuum/n < λ_vacuum.

**Discussion**

This relationship is crucial for understanding phenomena like thin film interference, where we must use the wavelength in the medium (λ_n = λ/n) rather than the wavelength in vacuum. The physical reason for the speed decrease is that light interacts with the atoms in the medium - the oscillating electric field of the light wave causes electrons to oscillate, and these oscillating electrons re-radiate light that interferes with the original wave, effectively slowing its propagation through the medium. However, the frequency must match the driving frequency of the original source, so wavelength is the parameter that adjusts.

Does Huygens's principle apply to all types of waves?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Huygens's principle is a geometric construction for determining wave propagation. We need to consider whether this principle is universal or has limitations.

**Solution**

**Yes**, Huygens's principle applies to all types of waves. It is a general principle of wave propagation that works for:

- **Mechanical waves**:
  - Water waves
  - Sound waves
  - Seismic waves
  - Waves on strings

- **Electromagnetic waves**:
  - Light (all wavelengths)
  - Radio waves
  - Microwaves
  - X-rays and gamma rays

- **Matter waves**:
  - Electron waves
  - Other quantum mechanical waves

The principle states that every point on a wavefront can be considered as a source of secondary wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the wave speed. The new wavefront is the envelope (tangent surface) of all these wavelets.

**Key characteristics that make it universal:**
1. It's based on the wave equation, which governs all wave phenomena
2. It correctly predicts diffraction, reflection, and refraction for all wave types
3. It doesn't depend on the specific physical nature of the wave (mechanical oscillation, electromagnetic field, probability amplitude, etc.)

**Discussion**

Huygens's principle is particularly powerful because it's a geometrical method that doesn't require detailed knowledge of the wave's physical mechanism. Whether we're dealing with vibrating water molecules, oscillating electromagnetic fields, or quantum probability amplitudes, the same principle applies. This universality is one reason why wave phenomena look similar across vastly different physical systems - from ripples in a pond to light diffracting through a slit to electron diffraction in a crystal. The principle does have some mathematical limitations (it doesn't fully account for the detailed amplitude and polarization in all cases without additional considerations), but its basic geometric approach to wave propagation is indeed universal.
