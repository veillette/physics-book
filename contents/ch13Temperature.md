The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold.
Human perception of what feels hot or cold is a relative one. For example, if
you place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, and then place both
hands in tepid water, the tepid water will feel cool to the hand that was in hot
water, and warm to the one that was in cold water. The scientific definition of
temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot and cold. **Temperature**
is operationally defined to be what we measure with a thermometer. (Many
physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured. We
shall see later how temperature is related to the kinetic energies of atoms and
molecules, a more physical explanation.) Two accurate thermometers, one placed
in hot water and the other in cold water, will show the hot water to have a
higher temperature. If they are then placed in the tepid water, both will give
identical readings (within measurement uncertainties). In this section, we
discuss temperature, its measurement by thermometers, and its relationship to
thermal equilibrium. Again, temperature is the quantity measured by a
thermometer.

Misconception Alert: Human Perception vs. Reality
</div>
On a cold winter morning, a wooden bench feels warmer than a metal bench. The wood and metal are in thermal equilibrium with the outside air, and are thus the same temperature. They **feel** different because of the difference in the way that they conduct heat away from your skin. The metal conducts heat away from your body faster than the wood does (see more about conductivity in [Conduction](../contents/ch14Conduction)). This is just one example demonstrating that the human sense of hot and cold is not determined by temperature alone.

Another factor that affects our perception of temperature is humidity. Most
people feel much hotter on hot, humid days than on hot, dry days. This is
because on humid days, sweat does not evaporate from the skin and in our lungs as efficiently as
it does on dry days. It is the evaporation of sweat (or water from a sprinkler
or pool) as well as water in the lungs that cools us off.

</div>

Any physical property that depends on temperature, and whose response to
temperature is reproducible, can be used as the basis of a thermometer. Because
many physical properties depend on temperature, the variety of thermometers is
remarkable. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances.
This property is the basis for the common alcohol thermometer, the old mercury
thermometer, and the bimetallic strip ([[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Other properties
used to measure temperature include electrical resistance and color, as shown
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), and the emission of infrared radiation, as shown
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

![This figure has two parts, each of which shows a blue metallic strip attached lengthwise to a yellow metallic strip, thus forming a bimetallic strip. In part a, the bimetallic strip is straight and oriented vertically, and its temperature is given as T sub 0. In part b, the bimetallic strip is curving rightward away from the vertical, and its temperature is given as T, which is greater than T sub 0.](../resources/Figure_13_01_01.jpg 'The curvature of a bimetallic strip depends on temperature.

### Temperature Scales

Thermometers are used to measure temperature according to well-defined scales of
measurement, which use pre-defined reference points to help compare quantities.
The three most common temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin
scales. A temperature scale can be created by identifying two easily
reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at
standard atmospheric pressure are commonly used.

The **Celsius** scale (which replaced the slightly different _centigrade_ scale)
has the freezing point of water at $$0\text{ºC} $$ and the boiling point at
$$100\text{ºC} $$ . Its unit is the **degree Celsius** $$\left(\text{ºC}\right)

$$
. On the **Fahrenheit** scale (still the most frequently used in the United
States), the freezing point of water is at $$32\text{ºF} $$ and the boiling
point is at $$212\text{ºF} $$ . The unit of temperature on this scale is the **degree Fahrenheit** $$\left(\text{ºF}\right) $$ . Note that a temperature
difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one
degree Fahrenheit. Only 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180
Fahrenheit degrees, thus one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger
than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale $$180/100=9/5\text{.} $$ The **Kelvin**
scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science. It is an *
absolute temperature* scale defined to have 0 K at the lowest possible
temperature, called **absolute zero**. The official temperature unit on this
scale is the **kelvin**, which is abbreviated K, and is not accompanied by a
degree sign. The freezing and boiling points of water are 273.15 K and 373.15 K,
respectively. Thus, the magnitude of temperature differences is the same in
units of kelvins and degrees Celsius. Unlike other temperature scales, the
Kelvin scale is an absolute scale. It is used extensively in scientific work
because a number of physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are
directly related to absolute temperature. The kelvin is the SI unit used in
scientific work.

![Three temperature scales&#x2014;Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin&#x2014;are oriented horizontally, one below the other, and aligned to show how they relate to each other. Absolute zero is at negative four hundred fifty nine point six seven degrees F, negative two hundred seventy three point one five degrees C, and 0 K. Water freezes at thirty two degrees F, 0 degrees C, and two hundred seventy three point one five K. Water boils at two hundred twelve degrees F, one hundred degrees C, and three hundred seventy three point one five K. A temperature difference of 9 degrees F is the same as a temperature difference of 5 degrees C and 5 K.](../resources/Figure_13_01_04.jpg "Relationships between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales, rounded to the nearest degree. The relative sizes of the scales are also shown.")
{: #Figure4}

The relationships between the three common temperature scales are shown
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). Temperatures on these scales can be converted using
the equations in [[Table 1]](#Table1).

Notice that the conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin look quite
complicated. In fact, they are simple combinations of the conversions between
Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the conversions between Celsius and Kelvin.

Converting between Temperature Scales: Room Temperature
</div>
“Room temperature” is generally defined to be  $$25\text{ºC} $$ .
 (a) What is room temperature in  $$\text{ºF} $$ ?
 (b) What is it in K?

**Strategy**

To answer these questions, all we need to do is choose the correct conversion
equations and plug in the known values.

**Solution for (a)**

1. Choose the right equation. To convert from $$\text{ºC} $$ to $$\text{ºF} $$ ,
   use the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}25\text{ºC}+32=77\text{ºF}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

1. Choose the right equation. To convert from $$\text{ºC} $$ to K, use the
   equation

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}+ 273.15 \text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}=25\text{ºC}+ 273.15 =298 \text{K}\text{.} $$
</div>

Converting between Temperature Scales: the Reaumur Scale
</div>
The Reaumur scale is a temperature scale that was used widely in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. On the Reaumur temperature scale, the freezing point of water is  $$0\text{ºR} $$
 and the boiling temperature is  $$80\text{ºR} $$ .
 If “room temperature” is  $$25\text{ºC} $$
 on the Celsius scale, what is it on the Reaumur scale?

**Strategy**

To answer this question, we must compare the Reaumur scale to the Celsius scale.
The difference between the freezing point and boiling point of water on the
Reaumur scale is $$80\text{ºR} $$ . On the Celsius scale it is $$100\text{ºC} $$
. Therefore $$100\text{ºC}=80\text{ºR} $$ . Both scales start at $$0\text{º} $$
for freezing, so we can derive a simple formula to convert between temperatures
on the two scales.

**Solution**

1. Derive a formula to convert from one scale to the other:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºR}}=\frac{ 0.8\text{ºR}}{\text{ºC}} × {T}_{\text{ºC}}\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºR}}=\frac{ 0.8\text{ºR}}{\text{ºC}} × 25\text{ºC}=20\text{ºR}\text{.} $$

### Temperature Ranges in the Universe

[[Figure 6]](#Figure6) shows the wide range of temperatures found in the
universe. Human beings have been known to survive with body temperatures within
a small range, from $$24\text{ºC} $$ to $$44\text{ºC} $$ $$\left(75\text{ºF} $$
to $$111\text{ºF} $$ ). The average normal body temperature is usually given as
$$ 37.0\text{ºC} $$
( $$ 98.6\text{ºF} $$ ), and variations in this temperature can indicate a
medical condition: a fever, an infection, a tumor, or circulatory problems (
see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

![This figure consists of four different infrared thermographs of a person\'s head and neck, taken when the person\'s head was positioned at four different angles. The person\'s face and neck are mostly red and orange, with patches of white, green, and yellow. The red and white colors correspond to hot areas. The person\'s hair ranges in color from green to light blue to dark blue. The blue color corresponds to cold areas.](../resources/Figure_13_01_05.jpg "This image of radiation from a person&#x2019;s body (an infrared thermograph) shows the location of temperature abnormalities in the upper body. Dark blue corresponds to cold areas and red to white corresponds to hot areas. An elevated temperature might be an indication of malignant tissue (a cancerous tumor in the breast, for example), while a depressed temperature might be due to a decline in blood flow from a clot. In this case, the abnormalities are caused by a condition called hyperhidrosis. (credit: Porcelina81, Wikimedia Commons)")

The lowest temperatures ever recorded have been measured during laboratory
experiments:  $$ 4.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{K} $$ at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (USA), and $$ 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \text{K} $$ at Helsinki
University of Technology (Finland). In comparison, the coldest recorded place on
Earth’s surface is Vostok, Antarctica at 183 K $$\left(-89\text{ºC}\right) $$ ,
and the coldest place (outside the lab) known in the universe is the Boomerang
Nebula, with a temperature of 1 K.

![The figure is a single vertical axis showing a wide range of temperatures on a logarithmic scale, measured in kelvin. The temperature range goes from the lowest temperature achieved at ten to the power of negative ten kelvin up to the temperature in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at ten to the power of positive twelve kelvin.](../resources/Figure_13_01_06.jpg "Each increment on this logarithmic scale indicates an increase by a factor of ten, and thus illustrates the tremendous range of temperatures in nature.

Making Connections: Absolute Zero
</div>
What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) shows how the pressure of gases at a constant volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature,  $$ - 273.15 \text{ºC} $$ .
 This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called *absolute zero*. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is  $$ - 273.15 \text{ºC} $$
 or 0 K.

#### Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Thermometers actually take their **own** temperature, not the temperature of the
object they are measuring. This raises the question of how we can be certain
that a thermometer measures the temperature of the object with which it is in
contact. It is based on the fact that any two systems placed in **thermal
contact** (meaning heat transfer can occur between them) will reach the same
temperature. That is, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one
until they have exactly the same temperature. The objects are then in **thermal
equilibrium**, and no further changes will occur. The systems interact and
change because their temperatures differ, and the changes stop once their
temperatures are the same. Thus, if enough time is allowed for this transfer of
heat to run its course, the temperature a thermometer registers **does**
represent the system with which it is in thermal equilibrium. Thermal
equilibrium is established when two bodies are in contact with each other and
can freely exchange energy.

Furthermore, experimentation has shown that if two systems, A and B, are in
thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a
third system C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This conclusion
may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic
to thermodynamics. It is called the **zeroth law of thermodynamics**.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
</div>
If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

</div>

This law was postulated in the 1930s, after the first and second laws of
thermodynamics had been developed and named. It is called the *zeroth law*
because it comes logically before the first and second laws (discussed
in [Thermodynamics](../contents/ch15Thermodynamics)). An example of this law in action is
seen in babies in incubators: babies in incubators normally have very few
clothes on, so to an observer they look as if they may not be warm enough.
However, the temperature of the air, the cot, and the baby is the same, because
they are in thermal equilibrium, which is accomplished by maintaining air
temperature to keep the baby comfortable.

#### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What does it mean to say that two systems are in thermal equilibrium?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider what happens when two objects at different temperatures are brought into thermal contact.

**Solution:**
Two systems are in thermal equilibrium when they are at the same temperature and there is no net heat transfer between them. When systems in thermal contact reach thermal equilibrium, their temperatures become equal and remain constant over time (assuming no external influences).

More specifically, thermal equilibrium means:
1. The two systems have the same temperature
2. No net energy flows between them as heat
3. Their macroscopic properties (like temperature, pressure, volume) remain constant
4. If a thermometer is placed in either system, it will read the same temperature

**Discussion:**
Thermal equilibrium is the basis for temperature measurement. When a thermometer is placed in contact with an object, heat flows between them until they reach thermal equilibrium. The thermometer then reads the temperature of the object. The zeroth law of thermodynamics formalizes this concept: if system A is in thermal equilibrium with system C, and system B is in thermal equilibrium with system C, then A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other (and all three have the same temperature).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Give an example of a physical property that varies with temperature and describe how it is used to measure temperature.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Think of properties that change predictably and measurably with temperature.

**Solution:**
Many physical properties vary with temperature and can be used for thermometry. Here are several examples:

1. **Volume expansion of liquids**: Mercury and alcohol thermometers use this property. As temperature increases, the liquid expands and rises in a narrow tube. The height of the liquid column is calibrated to indicate temperature. This works because liquids expand more than the glass container.

2. **Electrical resistance**: Resistance thermometers (RTDs) use metals like platinum whose electrical resistance increases predictably with temperature. By measuring resistance, temperature can be determined accurately.

3. **Thermoelectric voltage**: Thermocouples consist of two different metals joined together. When the junction is heated, a voltage is generated that depends on temperature. This voltage can be measured and converted to temperature.

4. **Color/radiation**: Infrared thermometers measure the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects. Hotter objects emit more infrared radiation, allowing non-contact temperature measurement.

**Discussion:**
Different temperature-dependent properties are useful in different ranges and applications. Mercury thermometers work well for everyday temperatures but are limited by mercury's freezing (−39ºC) and boiling (357ºC) points. Thermocouples can measure very high temperatures (up to 2000ºC), while resistance thermometers offer high precision for scientific work.

When a cold alcohol thermometer is placed in a hot liquid, the column of alcohol goes **down** slightly before going up. Explain why.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider which part of the thermometer heats up first and how thermal expansion occurs at different rates for glass and alcohol.

**Solution:**
When a cold thermometer is placed in hot liquid, the glass bulb and tube heat up first because they are in direct contact with the hot liquid. The glass expands, increasing the volume of the bulb and tube slightly. This expansion creates more space for the alcohol.

Initially, the alcohol inside is still cold and hasn't expanded yet. As the glass bulb expands, the same amount of alcohol now occupies a larger container volume, causing the alcohol level in the tube to drop slightly.

After this brief moment, heat conducts through the glass to the alcohol. The alcohol then heats up and expands. Since the coefficient of volume expansion for alcohol is much larger than for glass, the alcohol expands significantly more than the glass. This causes the alcohol column to rise, eventually reaching a height that indicates the temperature of the hot liquid.

**Discussion:**
This effect is transient and only noticeable when there's a large temperature difference between the thermometer and the liquid. It demonstrates the different rates of thermal expansion for different materials and the time required for heat to transfer through materials. Good thermometer design minimizes this effect by using thin glass bulbs that heat quickly and by choosing liquid-glass combinations with very different expansion coefficients.

If you add boiling water to a cup at room temperature, what would you expect the final equilibrium temperature of the unit to be? You will need to include the surroundings as part of the system. Consider the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider all components that will exchange heat: the boiling water, the cup, and the surrounding air. Apply the principle that heat flows from hot to cold until thermal equilibrium is reached.

**Solution:**
The final equilibrium temperature will be somewhere between room temperature and 100ºC, but will ultimately approach room temperature over time. The specific equilibrium temperature depends on several factors:

**Short-term equilibrium** (cup + water system):
- The boiling water (100ºC) will transfer heat to the cooler cup (≈20ºC)
- They will quickly reach an intermediate temperature, typically 80-95ºC depending on the masses and specific heats of water and cup material
- A ceramic cup will absorb less heat than a metal cup due to different heat capacities

**Long-term equilibrium** (including surroundings):
- The hot water-cup system then exchanges heat with the surrounding air at room temperature
- Heat continues to flow from the system to the surroundings
- Eventually, the entire system (water + cup + surrounding air) reaches thermal equilibrium at essentially room temperature

**Discussion:**
By the zeroth law of thermodynamics, when thermal equilibrium is reached, all parts of the system will be at the same temperature. In practice, in an open room with good air circulation, the final temperature will be very close to room temperature, though the room itself might warm slightly. If the system were perfectly insulated from its surroundings, the equilibrium temperature would be determined by the relative heat capacities and masses of the water and cup alone.

**Solution:**
Using the equation $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32$$:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}(39.0\text{ºC})+32=70.2+32=102.2\text{ºF}\approx 102\text{ºF} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
A temperature of 102ºF represents a significant fever. Normal body temperature is 98.6ºF (37.0ºC), so a fever of 102ºF is about 3.6ºF above normal. This level of fever indicates the body is fighting an infection and would typically warrant medical attention, especially if sustained or accompanied by other symptoms.

Frost damage to most plants occurs at temperatures of  $$ 28.0\text{ºF} $$
 or lower. What is this temperature on the Kelvin scale?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, then from Celsius to Kelvin.

**Solution:**
Convert ºF to ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left({T}_{\text{ºF}}-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}\left( 28.0-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}\left(-4.0\right)=-2.22\text{ºC} $$
</div>

Convert ºC to K:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}+ 273.15 =-2.22+ 273.15 = 271 \text{ K} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
This temperature of 271 K is just below the freezing point of water (273.15 K or 0ºC or 32ºF). Plants can often survive brief exposures to temperatures slightly below freezing, but prolonged exposure causes ice crystals to form in plant cells, rupturing cell walls and causing permanent damage. This is why farmers monitor frost warnings carefully and may use protective measures like covering plants or using heaters when temperatures approach 28ºF.

To conserve energy, room temperatures are kept at  $$ 68.0\text{ºF} $$
 in the winter and  $$ 78.0\text{ºF} $$
 in the summer. What are these temperatures on the Celsius scale?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the conversion equation from Fahrenheit to Celsius for each temperature.

**Solution:**
Using the equation $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left({T}_{\text{ºF}}-32\right)$$:

Winter temperature:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left(68.0-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}(36.0)=20.0\text{ºC} $$
</div>

Summer temperature:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left(78.0-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}(46.0)=25.6\text{ºC} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
These temperatures (20.0ºC in winter and 25.6ºC in summer) represent a reasonable range for energy-efficient building temperatures. The 10ºF (5.6ºC) difference between winter and summer settings reflects the fact that people dress more warmly in winter and more lightly in summer, so comfort can be maintained at different temperatures. This temperature difference also reduces heating costs in winter and cooling costs in summer, contributing to significant energy savings.

A tungsten light bulb filament may operate at 2900 K. What is its Fahrenheit temperature? What is this on the Celsius scale?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First convert from Kelvin to Celsius, then from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Solution:**
Convert K to ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}={T}_{\text{K}}- 273.15 = 2900- 273.15 = 2627\text{ºC}  $$
</div>

Convert ºC to ºF:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32=\frac{9}{5}\left( 2627\right)+32= 4761\text{ºF} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
This extremely high temperature (nearly 2627ºC or 4761ºF) explains why tungsten is used for incandescent light bulb filaments—it has the highest melting point of all metals (3422ºC). At this operating temperature, the filament glows white-hot, emitting visible light along with significant infrared radiation (heat). This is also why incandescent bulbs are inefficient—much of the energy goes into heat rather than visible light. The tungsten filament must be enclosed in an inert gas (argon or nitrogen) or vacuum to prevent oxidation at these extreme temperatures.

The surface temperature of the Sun is about 5750 K. What is this temperature on the Fahrenheit scale?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First convert from Kelvin to Celsius, then from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Solution:**
Convert K to ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}={T}_{\text{K}}- 273.15 = 5750- 273.15 = 5477\text{ºC} $$

</div>

**Discussion:**
This extremely high surface temperature of the Sun (5750 K or about 5477ºC or 9890ºF) is what causes the Sun to emit visible light and heat. At this temperature, the Sun's surface glows white-hot, emitting radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum with peak intensity in the visible range. This is why the Sun appears yellowish-white to our eyes. The core of the Sun is even hotter, at about 15 million kelvin, where nuclear fusion reactions occur. Understanding the Sun's temperature is crucial for astrophysics and for understanding how stars generate energy.

One of the hottest temperatures ever recorded on the surface of Earth was  $$134\text{ºF} $$
 in Death Valley, CA. What is this temperature in Celsius degrees? What is this temperature in Kelvin?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius first, then to Kelvin.

**Solution:**
Convert ºF to ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left({T}_{\text{ºF}}-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}\left(134-32\right)=\frac{5}{9}\left(102\right)= 56.7\text{ºC} $$

Convert ºC to K:
<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}+ 273.15 = 56.7+ 273.15 = 330 \text{ K} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
This temperature of 56.7ºC (134ºF or 330 K) is extremely hot and life-threatening for humans without proper precautions. At such temperatures, the human body's cooling mechanisms (primarily evaporative cooling through sweating) are severely challenged, especially if humidity is also high. Death Valley holds this record due to its below-sea-level elevation, surrounding mountains that trap heat, and desert conditions that prevent cloud cover and evaporative cooling. For comparison, normal human body temperature is 37ºC, so this environmental temperature is nearly 20ºC higher than body temperature, making heat gain from the environment a serious concern.

(a) At what temperature do the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales have the same numerical value? (b) At what temperature do the Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales have the same numerical value?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Set $$T_{\text{ºF}}=T_{\text{ºC}}=T$$ and solve using the conversion equation. (b) Set $$T_{\text{ºF}}=T_{\text{K}}=T$$ and solve using the appropriate conversions.

**Solution:**
(a) Using the equation $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32$$, and setting $${T}_{\text{ºF}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}=T$$:

<div class="equation" >
 $$T=\frac{9}{5}T+32 $$
</div>

Solving for T:
<div class="equation" >
 $$T-\frac{9}{5}T=32 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$-\frac{4}{5}T=32 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$T=-40 $$
</div>

Therefore, −40ºC = −40ºF.

(b) Using $${T}_{\text{K}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}+ 273.15$$ and $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32$$, and setting $${T}_{\text{ºF}}={T}_{\text{K}}=T$$:

From the first equation: $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=T- 273.15$$

Substituting into the second equation:
<div class="equation" >
 $$T=\frac{9}{5}\left(T- 273.15\right)+32 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$T=\frac{9}{5}T- 491.67 +32 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$T-\frac{9}{5}T=- 459.67 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$-\frac{4}{5}T=- 459.67 $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$T= 574.6 \text{ K} = 574.6\text{ºF} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The temperature of −40 degrees is the unique point where Celsius and Fahrenheit scales intersect, making it a memorable reference point. This temperature is encountered in very cold climates like Antarctica or northern Canada in winter. The Fahrenheit-Kelvin equivalence at 574.6 degrees occurs at a very high temperature (301.4ºC), well above the boiling point of water. These equivalence points are mathematical curiosities that arise from the different zero points and scale sizes of the temperature systems.
