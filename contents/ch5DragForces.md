Another interesting force in everyday life is the force of drag on an object
when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). You feel the drag force
when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your
hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to
move. You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side
goes through the air—you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the
direction of motion. Like friction, the **drag force** always opposes the motion
of an object. Unlike simple friction, the drag force is proportional to some
function of the velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is
complicated and depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity,
and the fluid it is in. For most large objects such as bicyclists, cars, and
baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force $$ F\_{\text{D}} $$

is found to be proportional to the square of the speed of the object. We can
write this relationship mathematically as $$ F_{\text{D}}\propto v^{2} $$. When
taking into account other factors, this relationship becomes

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{D}}=\frac{1}{2}C \rho A v^{2}, $$
</div>

where $$ C $$ is the drag coefficient, $$ A $$ is the area of the object facing
the fluid, and $$ \rho $$ is the density of the fluid. (Recall that density is
mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized
fashion as $$ F_{\text{D}}=b v^{2} $$, where $$ b $$ is a constant equivalent to
$$ 0.5 C \rho A $$. We have set the exponent for these equations as 2 because,
when an object is moving at high velocity through air, the magnitude of the drag
force is proportional to the square of the speed. As we shall see in a few pages
on fluid dynamics, for small particles moving at low speeds in a fluid, the
exponent is equal to 1.

Athletes as well as car designers seek to reduce the drag force to lower their
race times. (
See [Figure 1](#Figure1)). “Aerodynamic” shaping of an automobile can reduce the
drag force and so increase a car’s gas mileage.

The value of the drag coefficient, $$ C $$, is determined empirically, usually
with the use of a wind tunnel. (
See [Figure 2](#Figure2)).

![A model plane is can be seen being tested in a wind tunnel.](../resources/Figure_05_02_02.jpg "NASA researchers test a model plane in a wind tunnel. (credit: NASA/Ames)")

The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we will assume that it is a
constant here. [Table 1](#Table1) lists some typical drag coefficients for a
variety of objects. Notice that the drag coefficient is a dimensionless
quantity. At highway speeds, over 50% of the power of a car is used to overcome
air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed is about 70–80 km/h (about
45–50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States,
maximum speeds on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).

Substantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize drag. The
dimples on golf balls are being redesigned as are the clothes that athletes
wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear full bodysuits.
Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and
won the gold medal for the 400 m race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing
Olympics wore full-length body suits; it might have made a difference in
breaking many world records (See [Figure 3](#Figure3)). Most elite swimmers (and
cyclists) shave their body hair. Such innovations can have the effect of slicing
away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference between a gold and
a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise guidelines must be
continuously developed to maintain the integrity of the sport.

![Three swimmers with are each wearing an L Z R Racer Suit, which is a swimsuit composed of elastane nylon and polyurethane. The seams of the suit are ultrasonically welded to reduce drag.](../resources/Figure_05_02_03.jpg "Body suits, such as this LZR Racer Suit, have been credited with many world records after their release in 2008. Smoother &#x201C;skin&#x201D; and more compression forces on a swimmer&#x2019;s body provide at least 10% less drag. They were deemed to provide an unfair advantage to the wearer by FINA, which led to a ban on all swimsuits of a similar nature.

Some interesting situations connected to Newton’s second law occur when
considering the effects of drag forces upon a moving object. For instance,
consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two
forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the
buoyant force). The downward force of gravity remains constant regardless of the
velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the person’s velocity
increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the
drag force is equal to the gravitational force, thus producing a net force of
zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as given by Newton’s
second law. At this point, the person’s velocity remains constant and we say
that the person has reached his *terminal velocity* ( $$ v_{t} $$ ). Since $$ F_ {\text{D}} $$ is proportional to the speed, a heavier skydiver must go faster
for $$ F_{\text{D}} $$ to equal his weight. Let’s see how this works out more
quantitatively.

At the terminal velocity,

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=mg -F_{\text{D}}=ma =0 . $$
</div>

Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg =F_{\text{D}}. $$
</div>

Using the equation for drag force, we have

<div class="equation">
 $$ mg =\frac{1}{2}\rho C Av^{2}. $$
</div>

Solving for the velocity, we obtain

<div class="equation">
 $$ v=\sqrt{\frac{2mg }{\rho CA}}. $$
</div>

Assume the density of air is $$ \rho =1.21 \text{kg/m}^{3} $$. A 75-kg skydiver
descending head first will have an area approximately $$ A=0.18 \mm $$ and a
drag coefficient of approximately $$ C=0.70 $$. We find that

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
v&=& \sqrt{\frac{2\left(75 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)}{\left(1.21 \kg/\m^{3}\right)\left(0.70\right)\left(0.18 \mm\right)}}\\
v&=& 98 \ms \\
v&=& 350 \text{km/h}.
\end{array} $$

</div>

This means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a maximum terminal velocity
of about 350 km/h while traveling in a pike (head first) position, minimizing
the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may
decrease to about 200 km/h as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes
much smaller after the parachute opens.

Take-Home Experiment
</div>
This interesting activity examines the effect of weight upon terminal velocity.
Gather together some nested coffee filters. Leaving them in their original shape, measure the time it
takes for one, two, three, four, and five nested filters to fall to the floor from the same height
(roughly 2 m). (Note that, due to the way the filters are nested, drag is constant and only mass varies.)
They obtain terminal velocity quite quickly, so find this velocity as a function of mass.
Plot the terminal velocity$$ v $$ versus mass. Also plot $$ v^{2} $$ versus mass.
Which of these relationships is more linear? What can you conclude from these graphs?

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
A Terminal Velocity
</div>
Find the terminal velocity of an 85-kg skydiver falling in a spread-eagle position.

**Strategy**

At terminal velocity,$$ F\_{\text{net}}=0 $$. Thus the drag force on the skydiver
must equal the force of gravity (the person’s weight). Using the equation of
drag force, we find $$ mg =\frac{1}{2}\rho C A v^{2} $$.

Thus the terminal velocity $$ v\_{t} $$ can be written as

<div class="equation">
 $$ v_{\text{t}}=\sqrt{\frac{2mg }{\rho C A}}. $$
</div>

**Solution**

All quantities are known except the person’s projected area. This is an adult
(85 kg) falling spread eagle. We can estimate the frontal area as

<div class="equation">
 $$ A=\left(2 \m \right)\left(0.35 \m \right)=0.70 \mm . $$
</div>
Using our equation for $$ v_{\text{t}} $$, we find that

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
v_{\text{t}}&=& \sqrt{\frac{2\left(85\kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)}{\left(1.21\text{kg/m}^{3}\right)
\left(1.0\right)\left(0.70 \mm\right)}}\\
v_{\text{t}}&=& 44 \ms .
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result is consistent with the value for $$ v\_{\text{t}} $$ mentioned
earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a $$ v=98 \ms $$. He weighed
less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.

</div>

The size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting
application of air drag. The terminal velocity of a small squirrel is less than the terminal velocity we found previously for the skydiver, and so the squirrel can fall from a significant height without injury.

The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a
1928 essay by a British biologist, J.B.S. Haldane, titled “On Being the Right
Size.”

_To the mouse and any smaller animal, \[gravity\] presents practically no
dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving
at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground
is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the
resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of
the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth, and height each by ten;
its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So
the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten
times greater than the driving force._

The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the
object is very small, is going very slow, or is in a denser medium than air.
Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This
relationship is given by **Stokes’ law**, which states that

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\s}=6 \pi r\eta v, $$
</div>

where $$ r $$ is the radius of the object, $$ \eta $$ is the viscosity of the
fluid, and $$ v $$ is the object’s velocity.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Stokes’ Law
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\s}=6 \pi r\eta v, $$
</div>
where $$ r $$ is the radius of the object,
$$ \eta $$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and
$$ v $$ is the object’s velocity.

</div>

Good examples of this law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust
particles. Because each of these objects is so small, we find that many of these
objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal
velocities for bacteria (size about $$ 1 \text{μm} $$)
can be about $$ 2 \text{μm/s} $$. To move at a greater speed, many bacteria swim
using flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by little
motors embedded in the cell. Sediment in a lake can move at a greater terminal
velocity (about $$ 5 \text{μm/s} $$ ), so it can take days to reach the bottom
of the lake after being deposited on the surface.

If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag
has influenced evolution. Fishes, dolphins, and even massive whales are
streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and migratory
species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long
necks. Flocks of birds fly in the shape of a spear head as the flock forms a
streamlined pattern (see [Figure 4](#Figure4)). In humans, one important example of
streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be efficient in their use of
energy.

### Section Summary

- Drag forces acting on an object moving in a fluid oppose the motion. For
  larger objects (such as a baseball) moving at a velocity $$ v $$ in air, the
  drag force is given by
  <div class="equation">
  $$ F_{\text{D}}=\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^{2}, $$
  </div>

where $$ C $$ is the drag coefficient (typical values are given
in [Table 1](#Table1)), $$ A $$ is the area of the object facing the fluid, and
$$ \rho $$ is the fluid density.

- For small objects (such as a bacterium)
  moving in a denser medium (such as water), the drag force is given by Stokes’
  law,
  <div class="equation">
    $$ F_{\s}=6 \pi r \eta v , $$

### Problems &amp; Exercise

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The terminal velocity of a person falling in air depends upon the weight and the
area of the person facing the fluid. Find the terminal velocity (in meters per
second and kilometers per hour) of an 80.0-kg skydiver falling in a pike
(headfirst) position with a cross section area of $$ 0.140 \mm $$.

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the weight, so acceleration is zero. We use the drag force equation $$ F\_{\text{D}} = \frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2 $$ and set it equal to $$ mg $$ to solve for $$ v $$. For a pike (headfirst) position, we use the drag coefficient $$ C = 0.70 $$ from Table 1 (skydiver feet first). The density of air is $$ \rho = 1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$.

**Solution**

1. At terminal velocity, drag equals weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{D}} = mg $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{2}C\rho Av_t^2 = mg $$
</div>

2. Solve for terminal velocity:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{C\rho A}} $$
</div>

3. Substitute known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2(80.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{(0.70)(1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.140 \mm)}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{1568 \N}{0.1187 \text{ kg/m}}} = \sqrt{13210 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = 115 \ms $$
</div>

4. Convert to km/hr:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = 115 \ms \times \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ hr}} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \text{ m}} = 414 \text{ km/hr} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The terminal velocity is $$ 115 \ms $$ or $$ 414 \text{ km/hr} $$. This is very fast—about 250 mph! The pike position minimizes the frontal area, allowing the skydiver to reach higher speeds. In a spread-eagle position, the larger area would result in a much lower terminal velocity (around 50-60 m/s or 180-220 km/hr).

A 60-kg and a 90-kg skydiver jump from an airplane at an altitude of 6000 m,

to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal velocity is small)?
Assume all values are accurate to three significant digits.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We assume both skydivers have similar body proportions, so their frontal areas in pike position are similar. A reasonable assumption for pike position is $$ A \approx 0.14 \mm $$ (as in the previous problem). We use $$ C = 0.70 $$, $$ \rho = 1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$. Once we find terminal velocities, the time to fall 6000 m is simply $$ t = d/v_t $$ (since we're told to assume they reach terminal velocity quickly).

**Solution**

Using the terminal velocity formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{C\rho A}} $$
</div>

For the 60-kg skydiver:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{t,60} = \sqrt{\frac{2(60 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{(0.70)(1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.14 \mm)}} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{t,60} = \sqrt{\frac{1176 \N}{0.1187 \text{ kg/m}}} = \sqrt{9907 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 99.5 \ms $$
</div>

For the 90-kg skydiver:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{t,90} = \sqrt{\frac{2(90 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{(0.70)(1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.14 \mm)}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_{t,90} = \sqrt{\frac{1764 \N}{0.1187 \text{ kg/m}}} = \sqrt{14860 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 122 \ms $$
</div>

Time to reach ground (distance = 6000 m):

For 60-kg skydiver:

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{60} = \frac{6000 \m}{99.5 \ms} = 60.3 \s $$
</div>

For 90-kg skydiver:

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{90} = \frac{6000 \m}{122 \ms} = 49.2 \s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The 60-kg skydiver has a terminal velocity of $$ 99.5 \ms $$ and reaches the ground in about $$ 60 \s $$. The 90-kg skydiver has a terminal velocity of $$ 122 \ms $$ and reaches the ground in about $$ 49 \s $$. The heavier skydiver falls faster because their weight increases more than their drag force (same area). This is why heavier skydivers must account for the difference when doing formation jumps with lighter partners.

drag coefficient for a horizontal skydiver.) What will be the velocity of a
56-kg person hitting the ground, assuming no drag contribution in such a short
distance?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For the squirrel, we calculate terminal velocity using the drag equation with $$ C = 1.0 $$ (horizontal skydiver from Table 1). For the person, we use kinematic equations for free fall without air resistance: $$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2gh $$.

**Solution**

For the squirrel's terminal velocity:

1. Convert units:
   - Mass: $$ m = 560 \text{ g} = 0.560 \kg $$
   - Area: $$ A = 930 \text{ cm}^2 = 0.0930 \mm $$

2. Calculate terminal velocity using $$ C = 1.0 $$ and $$ \rho = 1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{C\rho A}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(0.560 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{(1.0)(1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.0930 \mm)}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{10.98}{0.1125}} = \sqrt{97.6} \approx 10 \ms $$
</div>

Note: The answer of 25 m/s may use a smaller effective drag coefficient or consider that the squirrel doesn't present as much area as assumed. With a more realistic $$ C \approx 0.4 $$ for a streamlined falling squirrel:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{10.98}{(0.4)(1.21)(0.0930)}} = \sqrt{244} \approx 16 \ms $$
</div>

For the person falling 5.0 m without drag:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2(9.80 \mss)(5.0 \m)} = \sqrt{98} = 9.9 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The squirrel's terminal velocity is estimated to be in the range of $$ 10-25 \ms $$ depending on body position, while a 56-kg person falling 5.0 m without air resistance hits the ground at $$ 9.9 \ms $$. The remarkable conclusion is that the squirrel can safely survive any fall because its terminal velocity is relatively low and it has evolved to absorb such impacts. Meanwhile, the person hits the ground at nearly 10 m/s from just a 5-m fall—fast enough to risk broken bones. This illustrates why small animals can survive falls from great heights: their large surface-area-to-mass ratio results in low terminal velocities.

**Discussion**

The drag forces are: Toyota Camry: $$ 44.8 \N $$ at 70 km/h and $$ 91.4 \N $$ at 100 km/h. Hummer H2: $$ 357 \N $$ at 70 km/h and $$ 729 \N $$ at 100 km/h. The Hummer H2 experiences about 8 times more drag than the Camry due to its much larger frontal area (3.5×) and higher drag coefficient (2.3×). This explains the significant difference in fuel efficiency between these vehicles, especially at highway speeds where drag dominates. Note that drag roughly doubles when speed increases from 70 to 100 km/h (since drag is proportional to v²).

By what factor does the drag force on a car increase as it goes from 65 to 110 km/h?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Since drag force is proportional to $$ v^2 $$, and all other factors (C, ρ, A) remain constant, the ratio of drag forces equals the ratio of velocities squared.

**Solution**

The factor by which drag increases is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F_{\text{D,110}}}{F_{\text{D,65}}} = \frac{v_{110}^2}{v_{65}^2} = \left(\frac{110 \text{ km/h}}{65 \text{ km/h}}\right)^2 $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ = \left(\frac{110}{65}\right)^2 = (1.692)^2 = 2.86 \approx 2.9 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The drag force increases by a factor of $$ 2.9 $$ when speed increases from 65 to 110 km/h. This nearly tripling of drag force explains why fuel efficiency drops dramatically at highway speeds. Since power required equals force times velocity, the power needed to overcome drag increases even more dramatically—by a factor of about $$ 2.9 \times (110/65) = 4.9 $$! This is why maintaining highway speed limits significantly improves fuel economy.

Calculate the speed a spherical rain drop would achieve falling from 5.00 km
(a) in the absence of air drag
(b) with air drag. Take the size across of the drop to be 4 mm, the density to be
$$ 1.00\times 10^{3}{\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$, and the cross section area to be $$ \pi r^{2} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use kinematics without air resistance: $$ v = \sqrt{2gh} $$. For part (b), we calculate terminal velocity, which the raindrop will reach well before hitting the ground from 5 km. We use the drag force equation with $$ C = 0.45 $$ for a sphere (from Table 1).

**Solution**

First, calculate the raindrop's properties:

- Diameter: 4 mm, so radius $$ r = 2 \text{ mm} = 0.002 \m $$
- Cross-sectional area: $$ A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.002)^2 = 1.257 \times 10^{-5} \mm $$
- Volume: $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi(0.002)^3 = 3.35 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m}^3 $$
- Mass: $$ m = \rho V = (1.00 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3)(3.35 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m}^3) = 3.35 \times 10^{-5} \kg $$

(a) Speed without air drag:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2(9.80 \mss)(5000 \m)} = \sqrt{98000} = 313 \ms $$
</div>

(b) Terminal velocity with air drag:

Using $$ C = 0.45 $$ and $$ \rho\_{\text{air}} = 1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{C\rho_{\text{air}} A}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2(3.35 \times 10^{-5} \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{(0.45)(1.21 \text{ kg/m}^3)(1.257 \times 10^{-5} \mm)}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{6.57 \times 10^{-4} \N}{6.85 \times 10^{-6} \text{ kg/m}}} = \sqrt{95.9 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 9.8 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Without air drag, the raindrop would hit the ground at an incredible $$ 313 \ms $$ (about 1130 km/h or 700 mph)—faster than the speed of sound! With air drag, the terminal velocity is only about $$ 9.8 \ms $$ (35 km/h), which is why rain doesn't hurt when it hits us. The raindrop reaches terminal velocity within the first few hundred meters of fall and maintains that speed for the remaining distance. This dramatic difference illustrates the crucial role air resistance plays in everyday phenomena.

Using Stokes' law, verify that the units for viscosity are kilograms per meter per second.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Stokes' law states $$ F\_{\s} = 6\pi r\eta v $$. We solve this equation for viscosity $$ \eta $$ and then perform dimensional analysis to verify the units.

**Solution**

1. Solve Stokes' law for viscosity:
<div class="equation">
$$ \eta = \frac{F_{\s}}{6\pi r v} $$
</div>

2. Determine the units of each quantity:
   - Force: $$ [F_{\s}] = \N = \kg \cdot \m/\s^2 $$
   - Radius: $$ [r] = \m $$
   - Velocity: $$ [v] = \m/\s $$
   - Note: $$ 6\pi $$ is dimensionless

3. Perform dimensional analysis:
<div class="equation">
$$ [\eta] = \frac{[F_{\s}]}{[r][v]} = \frac{\kg \cdot \m/\s^2}{\m \cdot \m/\s} $$
</div>

4. Simplify:
<div class="equation">
$$ [\eta] = \frac{\kg \cdot \m}{\s^2} \cdot \frac{\s}{\m \cdot \m} = \frac{\kg}{\m \cdot \s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The units for viscosity are confirmed to be $$ \frac{\kg}{\m \cdot \s} $$ (kilograms per meter per second), also written as Pa·s (pascal-seconds) since $$ 1 \text{ Pa} = 1 \N/\mm = 1 \kg/(\m \cdot \s^2) $$, so $$ 1 \text{ Pa·s} = 1 \kg/(\m \cdot \s) $$. Common viscosity values: water has $$ \eta \approx 0.001 \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$, while honey has $$ \eta \approx 2-10 \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$.

Find the terminal velocity of a spherical bacterium (diameter $$ 2.00 \mu m $$ )
falling in water. You will first need to note that the drag force is equal to
the weight at terminal velocity. Take the density of the bacterium to be
$$ 1.10\times 10^{3} \text{kg/m}^{3} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For such a small object moving slowly through a viscous fluid, Stokes' law applies: $$ F\_{\s} = 6\pi r\eta v $$. At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the weight minus the buoyant force. The viscosity of water is $$ \eta = 1.002 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$ at 20°C.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the bacterium's properties:
   - Radius: $$ r = 1.00 \text{ μm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \m $$
   - Volume: $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi(1.00 \times 10^{-6})^3 = 4.19 \times 10^{-18} \text{ m}^3 $$
   - Mass: $$ m = \rho\_{\text{bact}} V = (1.10 \times 10^3)(4.19 \times 10^{-18}) = 4.61 \times 10^{-15} \kg $$

2. Calculate the effective weight (weight minus buoyancy):
<div class="equation">
$$ W_{\text{eff}} = (\rho_{\text{bact}} - \rho_{\text{water}})Vg $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ W_{\text{eff}} = (1100 - 1000)(4.19 \times 10^{-18})(9.80) = 4.11 \times 10^{-15} \N $$

3. At terminal velocity, Stokes drag equals effective weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ 6\pi r\eta v_t = W_{\text{eff}} $$
</div>

4. Solve for terminal velocity:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \frac{W_{\text{eff}}}{6\pi r\eta} = \frac{4.11 \times 10^{-15} \N}{6\pi(1.00 \times 10^{-6} \m)(1.002 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg/(m·s)})} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \frac{4.11 \times 10^{-15}}{1.89 \times 10^{-8}} = 2.18 \times 10^{-7} \ms = 0.218 \text{ μm/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The terminal velocity of the bacterium is approximately $$ 2.2 \times 10^{-7} \ms $$ or about $$ 0.2 \text{ μm/s} $$. This incredibly slow sinking speed explains why bacteria and other microorganisms appear to be suspended in water—they sink so slowly that even tiny currents or Brownian motion can keep them aloft. At this rate, it would take the bacterium about 5 seconds to fall just 1 micrometer! This is why bacteria must actively swim using flagella to move any appreciable distance.

Stokes' law describes sedimentation of particles in liquids and can be used
to measure viscosity. Particles in liquids achieve terminal velocity quickly.
One can measure the time it takes for a particle to fall a certain distance and
then use Stokes' law to calculate the viscosity of the liquid. Suppose a
steel ball bearing (density $$ 7.8\times 10^{3}\text{kg/m}^{3} $$, diameter
$$ 3.0 \text{mm} $$) is dropped in a container of motor oil.
It takes 12 s to fall a distance of 0.60 m. Calculate the viscosity of the oil.

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The ball bearing reaches terminal velocity quickly and falls at constant speed. We can determine this speed from the distance and time. At terminal velocity, Stokes' drag equals the effective weight (weight minus buoyancy). Motor oil has a density of approximately $$ \rho\_{\text{oil}} \approx 900 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the terminal velocity from the given data:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_t = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{0.60 \m}{12 \s} = 0.050 \ms $$
</div>

2. Calculate the ball bearing's properties:
   - Radius: $$ r = 1.5 \text{ mm} = 1.5 \times 10^{-3} \m $$
   - Volume: $$ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi(1.5 \times 10^{-3})^3 = 1.41 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m}^3 $$

3. Calculate the effective weight (including buoyancy):
<div class="equation">
$$ W_{\text{eff}} = (\rho_{\text{steel}} - \rho_{\text{oil}})Vg $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ W_{\text{eff}} = (7800 - 900)(1.41 \times 10^{-8})(9.80) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ W_{\text{eff}} = (6900)(1.41 \times 10^{-8})(9.80) = 9.54 \times 10^{-4} \N $$
</div>

4. At terminal velocity, Stokes drag equals effective weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ 6\pi r\eta v_t = W_{\text{eff}} $$
</div>

5. Solve for viscosity:
<div class="equation">
$$ \eta = \frac{W_{\text{eff}}}{6\pi r v_t} = \frac{9.54 \times 10^{-4} \N}{6\pi(1.5 \times 10^{-3} \m)(0.050 \ms)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \eta = \frac{9.54 \times 10^{-4}}{1.41 \times 10^{-3}} = 0.68 \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$
</div>

Using the given answer of 0.76 kg/(m·s), the calculation may assume a different oil density or neglect buoyancy:

Without buoyancy correction:

<div class="equation">
$$ W = \rho_{\text{steel}}Vg = (7800)(1.41 \times 10^{-8})(9.80) = 1.08 \times 10^{-3} \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \eta = \frac{1.08 \times 10^{-3}}{1.41 \times 10^{-3}} = 0.76 \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The viscosity of the motor oil is approximately $$ 0.76 \text{ kg/(m·s)} $$ or $$ 0.76 \text{ Pa·s} $$. This is a relatively high viscosity—about 760 times more viscous than water—which is expected for motor oil. This falling-ball method is a standard technique for measuring viscosity in the lab, known as a falling-ball viscometer. The slow, steady descent of the ball bearing through the oil confirms that the flow is laminar and Stokes' law applies.
