Many properties of matter and phenomena in nature are directly related to atomic
energy levels and their associated excitations and de-excitations. The color of
a rose, the output of a laser, and the transparency of air are but a few
examples. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) While it may not appear that
glow-in-the-dark pajamas and lasers have much in common, they are in fact
different applications of similar atomic de-excitations.

![The image shows several red and blue colored laser beams rays that look similar to searchlights.](../resources/Figure_30_05_00.jpg 'Light from a laser is based on a particular type of atomic de-excitation. (credit: Jeff Keyzer)')
{: #Figure1}

The color of a material is due to the ability of its atoms to absorb certain
wavelengths while reflecting or reemitting others. A simple red material, for
example a tomato, absorbs all visible wavelengths except red. This is because
the atoms of its hydrocarbon pigment (lycopene) have levels separated by a
variety of energies corresponding to all visible photon energies except red. Air
is another interesting example. It is transparent to visible light, because
there are few energy levels that visible photons can excite in air molecules and
atoms. Visible light, thus, cannot be absorbed. Furthermore, visible light is
only weakly scattered by air, because visible wavelengths are so much greater
than the sizes of the air molecules and atoms. Light must pass through
kilometers of air to scatter enough to cause red sunsets and blue skies.

### Fluorescence and Phosphorescence

The ability of a material to emit various wavelengths of light is similarly
related to its atomic energy levels. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a scorpion
illuminated by a UV lamp, sometimes called a black light. Some rocks also glow
in black light, the particular colors being a function of the rock’s mineral
composition. Black lights are also used to make certain posters glow.

![The image shows a scorpion hiding in the cracks of rocks. The skin of the scorpion glows blue when illuminated by an ultraviolet light in contrast to the rocks, which glow in violet color.](../resources/Figure_30_05_01.jpg 'Objects glow in the visible spectrum when illuminated by an ultraviolet (black) light. Emissions are characteristic of the mineral involved, since they are related to its energy levels. In the case of scorpions, proteins near the surface of their skin give off the characteristic blue glow. This is a colorful example of fluorescence in which excitation is induced by UV radiation while de-excitation occurs in the form of visible light. (credit: Ken Bosma, Flickr)')
{: #Figure2}

In the fluorescence process, an atom is excited to a level several steps above
its ground state by the absorption of a relatively high-energy UV photon. This
is called **atomic excitation**{: class="term"}. Once it is excited, the atom
can de-excite in several ways, one of which is to re-emit a photon of the same
energy as excited it, a single step back to the ground state. This is called **atomic de-excitation**{: class="term"}. All other paths of de-excitation involve
smaller steps, in which lower-energy (longer wavelength) photons are emitted.
Some of these may be in the visible range, such as for the scorpion
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). **Fluorescence** is defined to be any process in
which an atom or molecule, excited by a photon of a given energy, and de-excites
by emission of a lower-energy photon.

Fluorescence can be induced by many types of energy input. Fluorescent paint,
dyes, and even soap residues in clothes make colors seem brighter in sunlight by
converting some UV into visible light. X-rays can induce fluorescence, as is
done in x-ray fluoroscopy to make brighter visible images. Electric discharges
can induce fluorescence, as in so-called neon lights and in gas-discharge tubes
that produce atomic and molecular spectra. Common fluorescent lights use an
electric discharge in mercury vapor to cause atomic emissions from mercury
atoms. The inside of a fluorescent light is coated with a fluorescent material
that emits visible light over a broad spectrum of wavelengths. By choosing an
appropriate coating, fluorescent lights can be made more like sunlight or like
the reddish glow of candlelight, depending on needs. Fluorescent lights are more
efficient in converting electrical energy into visible light than incandescent
filaments (about four times as efficient), the blackbody radiation of which is
primarily in the infrared due to temperature limitations.

This atom is excited to one of its higher levels by absorbing a UV photon. It
can de-excite in a single step, re-emitting a photon of the same energy, or in
several steps. The process is called fluorescence if the atom de-excites in
smaller steps, emitting energy different from that which excited it.
Fluorescence can be induced by a variety of energy inputs, such as UV, X-rays,
and electrical discharge.

The spectacular Waitomo caves on North Island in New Zealand provide a natural
habitat for glow-worms. The glow-worms hang up to 70 silk threads of about 30 or
40 cm each to trap prey that fly towards them in the dark. The fluorescence
process is very efficient, with nearly 100% of the energy input turning into
light. (In comparison, fluorescent lights are about 20% efficient.)

Fluorescence has many uses in biology and medicine. It is commonly used to label
and follow a molecule within a cell. Such tagging allows one to study the
structure of DNA and proteins. Fluorescent dyes and antibodies are usually used
to tag the molecules, which are then illuminated with UV light and their
emission of visible light is observed. Since the fluorescence of each element is
characteristic, identification of elements within a sample can be done this way.

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a commonly used fluorescent dye called fluorescein.
Below that, [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) reveals the diffusion of a fluorescent dye in
water by observing it under UV light.

Nano-Crystals
</div>
Recently, a new class of fluorescent materials has appeared—“nano-crystals.” These are single-crystal molecules less than 100 nm in size. The smallest of these are called “quantum dots.” These semiconductor indicators are very small (2–6 nm) and provide improved brightness. They also have the advantage that all colors can be excited with the same incident wavelength. They are brighter and more stable than organic dyes and have a longer lifetime than conventional phosphors. They have become an excellent tool for long-term studies of cells, including migration and morphology. ([[Figure 5]](#Figure5).)

![A colorful microscope image of chicken cells is shown. The nuclei of cells glow blue while the neurofilaments that connect these cells glow green under ultraviolet light.](../resources/Figure_30_05_04.jpg 'Microscopic image of chicken cells using nano-crystals of a fluorescent dye. Cell nuclei exhibit blue fluorescence while neurofilaments exhibit green. (credit: Weerapong Prasongchean, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure5}

Once excited, an atom or molecule will usually spontaneously de-excite
quickly. (The electrons raised to higher levels are attracted to lower ones by
the positive charge of the nucleus.) Spontaneous de-excitation has a very short
mean lifetime of typically about $$10^{-8} \text{s} $$ . However, some levels
have significantly longer lifetimes, ranging up to milliseconds to minutes or
even hours. These energy levels are inhibited and are slow in de-exciting
because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower
levels. Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms, they are many
orders of magnitude longer than is typical and, thus, are said to be **metastable**, meaning relatively stable. **Phosphorescence** is the
de-excitation of a metastable state. Glow-in-the-dark materials, such as
luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children’s toys and pajamas,
are made of phosphorescent substances. Visible light excites the atoms or
molecules to metastable states that decay slowly, releasing the stored
excitation energy partially as visible light. In some ceramics, atomic
excitation energy can be frozen in after the ceramic has cooled from its firing.
It is very slowly released, but the ceramic can be induced to phosphoresce by
heating—a process called “thermoluminescence.” Since the release is slow,
thermoluminescence can be used to date antiquities. The less light emitted, the
older the ceramic. (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).)

![The image shows a statue of a Chinese ceramic lion figure.](../resources/Figure_30_05_05.jpg 'Atoms frozen in an excited state when this Chinese ceramic figure was fired can be stimulated to de-excite and emit EM radiation by heating a sample of the ceramic—a process called thermoluminescence. Since the states slowly de-excite over centuries, the amount of thermoluminescence decreases with age, making it possible to use this effect to date and authenticate antiquities. This figure dates from the 11th century. (credit: Vassil, Wikimedia Commons)')

### Lasers

Lasers today are commonplace. Lasers are used to read bar codes at stores and in
libraries, laser shows are staged for entertainment, laser printers produce
high-quality images at relatively low cost, and lasers send prodigious numbers
of telephone messages through optical fibers. Among other things, lasers are
also employed in surveying, weapons guidance, tumor eradication, retinal
welding, and for reading music CDs and computer CD-ROMs.

Why do lasers have so many varied applications? The answer is that lasers
produce single-wavelength EM radiation that is also very coherent—that is, the
emitted photons are in phase. Laser output can, thus, be more precisely
manipulated than incoherent mixed-wavelength EM radiation from other sources.
The reason laser output is so pure and coherent is based on how it is produced,
which in turn depends on a metastable state in the lasing material. Suppose a
material had the energy levels shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). When energy is
put into a large collection of these atoms, electrons are raised to all possible
levels. Most return to the ground state in less than about $$10^{-8} \text{s} $$
, but those in the metastable state linger. This includes those electrons
originally excited to the metastable state and those that fell into it from
above. It is possible to get a majority of the atoms into the metastable state,
a condition called a **population inversion**.

![Several layers of parallel lines showing different levels of energy of an atom. The lowest level is ground state, one level up is first metastable state, next level is second metastable state, and so on. In part a, an atom is in the ground state. In part b, atoms move to different states depending on the energy input in the form of photons. An atom with minimum energy input moves to the first metastable level. One with a greater energy input moves to the second level. One with even greater input moves to the fourth level. In part c, atoms originally at levels above the first metastable state give off energy in the form of photons as they drop back down to the first metastable state. The greater the drop, the more energy is given off.](../resources/Figure_30_05_06.jpg '(a) Energy-level diagram for an atom showing the first few states, one of which is metastable. (b) Massive energy input excites atoms to a variety of states. (c) Most states decay quickly, leaving electrons only in the metastable and ground state. If a majority of electrons are in the metastable state, a population inversion has been achieved.')
{: #Figure7}

Once a population inversion is achieved, a very interesting thing can happen, as
shown in [[Figure 8]](#Figure8). An electron spontaneously falls from the
metastable state, emitting a photon. This photon finds another atom in the
metastable state and stimulates it to decay, emitting a second photon of _the
same wavelength and in phase_ with the first, and so on. **Stimulated emission**
is the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons of a given
frequency, triggered by photons of the same frequency. For example, an excited
atom, with an electron in an energy orbit higher than normal, releases a photon
of a specific frequency when the electron drops back to a lower energy orbit. If
this photon then strikes another electron in the same high-energy orbit in
another atom, another photon of the same frequency is released. The emitted
photons and the triggering photons are always in phase, have the same
polarization, and travel in the same direction. The probability of absorption of
a photon is the same as the probability of stimulated emission, and so a
majority of atoms must be in the metastable state to produce energy. Einstein (
again Einstein, and back in 1917!) was one of the important contributors to the
understanding of stimulated emission of radiation. Among other things, Einstein
was the first to realize that stimulated emission and absorption are equally
probable. The laser acts as a temporary energy storage device that subsequently
produces a massive energy output of single-wavelength, in-phase photons.

![Several layers of parallel lines showing different levels of energy of an atom. The lowest level is ground state, one level up is first metastable state, next level is second metastable state, and so on. There are five steps shown. In the first step, an atom drops from the first metastable to the ground state, emitting a photon. This drop is spontaneous. In the second step, the emitted photo stimulates another atom to drop from the first metastable to the ground state, emitting another photons. In the third step, an atom is stimulated to drop, emitting a third photon. The process continues with a fourth and fifth step.](../resources/Figure_30_05_07.jpg 'One atom in the metastable state spontaneously decays to a lower level, producing a photon that goes on to stimulate another atom to de-excite. The second photon has exactly the same energy and wavelength as the first and is in phase with it. Both go on to stimulate the emission of other photons. A population inversion is necessary for there to be a net production rather than a net absorption of the photons.')
{: #Figure8}

The name **laser** is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission
of radiation, the process just described. The process was proposed and developed
following the advances in quantum physics. A joint Nobel Prize was awarded in
1964 to American Charles Townes (1915–), and Nikolay Basov (1922–2001) and
Aleksandr Prokhorov (1916–2002), from the Soviet Union, for the development of
lasers. The Nobel Prize in 1981 went to Arthur Schawlow (1921-1999) for
pioneering laser applications. The original devices were called masers, because
they produced microwaves. The first working laser was created in 1960 at Hughes
Research labs (CA) by T. Maiman. It used a pulsed high-powered flash lamp and a
ruby rod to produce red light. Today the name laser is used for all such devices
developed to produce a variety of wavelengths, including microwave, infrared,
visible, and ultraviolet radiation. [[Figure 9]](#Figure9) shows how a laser can
be constructed to enhance the stimulated emission of radiation. Energy input can
be from a flash tube, electrical discharge, or other sources, in a process
sometimes called optical pumping. A large percentage of the original pumping
energy is dissipated in other forms, but a population inversion must be
achieved. Mirrors can be used to enhance stimulated emission by multiple passes
of the radiation back and forth through the lasing material. One of the mirrors
is semitransparent to allow some of the light to pass through. The laser output
from a laser is a mere 1% of the light passing back and forth in a laser.

As described earlier in the section on laser vision correction, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou, working at University of Rochester, developed a method to greatly increase the power of lasers, while also enabling them to be miniaturized. By passing the light over a specific type of grating, their method segments (or chirps) the delivery of the beam components in a matter that generates little heat at the source. Chirped pulse amplification is now used in some of the world’s most powerful lasers as well as those commonly used to make precise microcuts or burns in medical applications. Strickland and Mourou were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018.

![There are three schematic figures showing the construction of a laser. The first figure shows two mirrors. One is a totally silvered mirror on left side and one partially silvered mirror on right side. Thus spontaneous emission begins with some photons escaping and others stimulating further emissions. The next figure shows an increase in stimulated emission by reflection of photons by mirrors. The final figure shows an increased number of stimulated photons escaping the partially silvered mirror on the right side.](../resources/Figure_30_05_08.jpg 'Typical laser construction has a method of pumping energy into the lasing material to produce a population inversion. (a) Spontaneous emission begins with some photons escaping and others stimulating further emissions. (b) and (c) Mirrors are used to enhance the probability of stimulated emission by passing photons through the material several times.')
{: #Figure9}

Lasers are constructed from many types of lasing materials, including gases,
liquids, solids, and semiconductors. But all lasers are based on the existence
of a metastable state or a phosphorescent material. Some lasers produce
continuous output; others are pulsed in bursts as brief as $$10^{-14} \text{s} $$ . Some laser outputs are fantastically powerful—some greater than $$10^{12} \text{W} $$ —but the more common, everyday lasers produce something on the order of $$10^{-3} \text{W} $$ . The helium-neon laser that produces a familiar red
light is very common. [[Figure 10]](#Figure10) shows the energy levels of helium
and neon, a pair of noble gases that work well together. An electrical discharge
is passed through a helium-neon gas mixture in which the number of atoms of
helium is ten times that of neon. The first excited state of helium is
metastable and, thus, stores energy. This energy is easily transferred by
collision to neon atoms, because they have an excited state at nearly the same
energy as that in helium. That state in neon is also metastable, and this is the
one that produces the laser output. (The most likely transition is to the nearby
state, producing 1.96 eV photons, which have a wavelength of 633 nm and appear
red.) A population inversion can be produced in neon, because there are so many
more helium atoms and these put energy into the neon. Helium-neon lasers often
have continuous output, because the population inversion can be maintained even
while lasing occurs. Probably the most common lasers in use today, including the
common laser pointer, are semiconductor or diode lasers, made of silicon. Here,
energy is pumped into the material by passing a current in the device to excite
the electrons. Special coatings on the ends and fine cleavings of the
semiconductor material allow light to bounce back and forth and a tiny fraction
to emerge as laser light. Diode lasers can usually run continually and produce
outputs in the milliwatt range.

![On the left side of the figure, the ground state and first metastable state of helium atom are shown, and on the right side, the ground state and first metastable state of neon atom are shown. The difference between the two states of helium and neon atoms are estimated to be twenty point six one electron volts and twenty point six six electron volts, respectively. The collision transfer energy from helium to neon atoms is given as one point nine six electron volts.](../resources/Figure_30_05_09.jpg 'Energy levels in helium and neon. In the common helium-neon laser, an electrical discharge pumps energy into the metastable states of both atoms. The gas mixture has about ten times more helium atoms than neon atoms. Excited helium atoms easily de-excite by transferring energy to neon in a collision. A population inversion in neon is achieved, allowing lasing by the neon to occur.')
{: #Figure10}

There are many medical applications of lasers. Lasers have the advantage that
they can be focused to a small spot. They also have a well-defined wavelength.
Many types of lasers are available today that provide wavelengths from the
ultraviolet to the infrared. This is important, as one needs to be able to
select a wavelength that will be preferentially absorbed by the material of
interest. Objects appear a certain color because they absorb all other visible
colors incident upon them. What wavelengths are absorbed depends upon the energy
spacing between electron orbitals in that molecule. Unlike the hydrogen atom,
biological molecules are complex and have a variety of absorption wavelengths or
lines. But these can be determined and used in the selection of a laser with the
appropriate wavelength. Water is transparent to the visible spectrum but will
absorb light in the UV and IR regions. Blood (hemoglobin) strongly reflects red
but absorbs most strongly in the UV.

Laser surgery uses a wavelength that is strongly absorbed by the tissue it is
focused upon. One example of a medical application of lasers is shown
in [[Figure 11]](#Figure11). A detached retina can result in total loss of
vision. Burns made by a laser focused to a small spot on the retina form scar
tissue that can hold the retina in place, salvaging the patient’s vision. Other
light sources cannot be focused as precisely as a laser due to refractive
dispersion of different wavelengths. Similarly, laser surgery in the form of
cutting or burning away tissue is made more accurate because laser output can be
very precisely focused and is preferentially absorbed because of its single
wavelength. Depending upon what part or layer of the retina needs repairing, the
appropriate type of laser can be selected. For the repair of tears in the
retina, a green argon laser is generally used. This light is absorbed well by
tissues containing blood, so coagulation or “welding” of the tear can be done.

![The image shows the retina of a human eye. Only a small spot on the retina is burned by a laser without affecting other areas of the retina.](../resources/Figure_30_05_10.jpg 'A detached retina is burned by a laser designed to focus on a small spot on the retina, the resulting scar tissue holding it in place. The lens of the eye is used to focus the light, as is the device bringing the laser output to the eye.')
{: #Figure11}

In dentistry, the use of lasers is rising. Lasers are most commonly used for
surgery on the soft tissue of the mouth. They can be used to remove ulcers, stop
bleeding, and reshape gum tissue. Their use in cutting into bones and teeth is
not quite so common; here the erbium YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser is
used.

The massive combination of lasers shown in [[Figure 12]](#Figure12) can be used
to induce nuclear fusion, the energy source of the sun and hydrogen bombs. Since
lasers can produce very high power in very brief pulses, they can be used to
focus an enormous amount of energy on a small glass sphere containing fusion
fuel. Not only does the incident energy increase the fuel temperature
significantly so that fusion can occur, it also compresses the fuel to great
density, enhancing the probability of fusion. The compression or implosion is
caused by the momentum of the impinging laser photons.

![The image shows the inner part of a large shell-like structure where two persons are standing on a boom. The image also shows a sharp pencil shaped structure that serves to hold the fuel pellet at the focus point of all the lasers.](../resources/Figure_30_05_11.jpg 'This system of lasers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is used to ignite nuclear fusion.

Music CDs are now so common that vinyl records are quaint antiquities. CDs (and
DVDs) store information digitally and have a much larger information-storage
capacity than vinyl records. An entire encyclopedia can be stored on a single
CD. [[Figure 13]](#Figure13) illustrates how the information is stored and read
from the CD. Pits made in the CD by a laser can be tiny and very accurately
spaced to record digital information. These are read by having an inexpensive
solid-state infrared laser beam scatter from pits as the CD spins, revealing
their digital pattern and the information encoded upon them.

![Several spiral tracks of a CD are shown on which a laser beam is incident. An enlarged view of part of the tracks on the CD surface are shown. The track consists of a sequence of short or long pits, with the space between pits being labeled as land. Finally, an enlarged view of a single pit is shown with depth labeled as t.](../resources/Figure_30_05_12.jpg 'A CD has digital information stored in the form of laser-created pits on its surface. These in turn can be read by detecting the laser light scattered from the pit. Large information capacity is possible because of the precision of the laser. Shorter-wavelength lasers enable greater storage capacity.')

Holograms, such as those in [[Figure 14]](#Figure14), are true three-dimensional
images recorded on film by lasers. Holograms are used for amusement, decoration
on novelty items and magazine covers, security on credit cards and driver’s
licenses (a laser and other equipment is needed to reproduce them), and for
serious three-dimensional information storage. You can see that a hologram is a
true three-dimensional image, because objects change relative position in the
image when viewed from different angles.

![The image shows a rainbow-colored hologram of a bird on a credit card.](../resources/Figure_30_05_13.jpg 'Credit cards commonly have holograms for logos, making them difficult to reproduce (credit: Dominic Alves, Flickr)')
{: #Figure14}

The name **hologram** means “entire picture” (from the Greek _holo_, as in
holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. **Holography** is the process
of producing holograms and, although they are recorded on photographic film, the
process is quite different from normal photography. Holography uses light
interference or wave optics, whereas normal photography uses geometric
optics. [[Figure 15]](#Figure15) shows one method of producing a hologram.
Coherent light from a laser is split by a mirror, with part of the light
illuminating the object. The remainder, called the reference beam, shines
directly on a piece of film. Light scattered from the object interferes with the
reference beam, producing constructive and destructive interference. As a
result, the exposed film looks foggy, but close examination reveals a
complicated interference pattern stored on it. Where the interference was
constructive, the film (a negative actually) is darkened. Holography is
sometimes called lensless photography, because it uses the wave characteristics
of light as contrasted to normal photography, which uses geometric optics and so
requires lenses.

![The schematic representation shows that coherent light from a laser is incident on an object which is a dinosaur and also on a tilted mirror, which reflects the light at an angle. Then, the reflected light from the mirror and the reflected object wave fall on a photo plate simultaneously.](../resources/Figure_30_05_14.jpg 'Production of a hologram. Single-wavelength coherent light from a laser produces a well-defined interference pattern on a piece of film. The laser beam is split by a partially silvered mirror, with part of the light illuminating the object and the remainder shining directly on the film.')
{: #Figure15}

Light falling on a hologram can form a three-dimensional image. The process is
complicated in detail, but the basics can be understood as shown
in [[Figure 16]](#Figure16), in which a laser of the same type that exposed the
film is now used to illuminate it. The myriad tiny exposed regions of the film
are dark and block the light, while less exposed regions allow light to pass.
The film thus acts much like a collection of diffraction gratings with various
spacings. Light passing through the hologram is diffracted in various
directions, producing both real and virtual images of the object used to expose
the film. The interference pattern is the same as that produced by the object.
Moving your eye to various places in the interference pattern gives you
different perspectives, just as looking directly at the object would. The image
thus looks like the object and is three-dimensional like the object.

![The figure shows a reference light wave passing through a hologram. An external eye sees the virtual image of a dinosaur created from the reflection of the real image of the dinosaur by the hologram.](../resources/Figure_30_05_15.jpg 'A transmission hologram is one that produces real and virtual images when a laser of the same type as that which exposed the hologram is passed through it. Diffraction from various parts of the film produces the same interference pattern as the object that was used to expose it.')
{: #Figure16}

The hologram illustrated in [[Figure 16]](#Figure16) is a transmission hologram.
Holograms that are viewed with reflected light, such as the white light
holograms on credit cards, are reflection holograms and are more common. White
light holograms often appear a little blurry with rainbow edges, because the
diffraction patterns of various colors of light are at slightly different
locations due to their different wavelengths. Further uses of holography include
all types of 3-D information storage, such as of statues in museums and
engineering studies of structures and 3-D images of human organs. Invented in
the late 1940s by Dennis Gabor (1900–1979), who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in
Physics for his work, holography became far more practical with the development
of the laser. Since lasers produce coherent single-wavelength light, their
interference patterns are more pronounced. The precision is so great that it is
even possible to record numerous holograms on a single piece of film by just
changing the angle of the film for each successive image. This is how the
holograms that move as you walk by them are produced—a kind of lensless movie.

In a similar way, in the medical field, holograms have allowed complete 3-D
holographic displays of objects from a stack of images. Storing these images for
future use is relatively easy. With the use of an endoscope, high-resolution 3-D
holographic images of internal organs and tissues can be made.

### Section Summary

- An important atomic process is fluorescence, defined to be any process in
  which an atom or molecule is excited by absorbing a photon of a given energy
  and de-excited by emitting a photon of a lower energy.
- Some states live much longer than others and are termed metastable.
- Phosphorescence is the de-excitation of a metastable state.
- Lasers produce coherent single-wavelength EM radiation by stimulated emission,
  in which a metastable state is stimulated to decay.
- Lasing requires a population inversion, in which a majority of the atoms or
  molecules are in their metastable state.

[[Figure 10]](#Figure10) shows the energy-level diagram for neon. (a) Verify that the energy of the photon emitted when neon goes from its metastable state to the one immediately below is equal to 1.96 eV. (b) Show that the wavelength of this radiation is 633 nm. (c) What wavelength is emitted when the neon makes a direct transition to its ground state?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 10]](#Figure10), we can identify the energy levels of neon. The metastable state is at 20.66 eV, and the state immediately below it is at 18.70 eV. For part (a), we calculate the energy difference between these levels. For part (b), we use the relationship $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} $$ with the convenient form $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ . For part (c), we calculate the energy difference from the metastable state to the ground state (0 eV) and find the corresponding wavelength.

**Solution**

(a) The energy of the photon emitted when neon transitions from the metastable state to the level immediately below is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = 20.66 \text{ eV} - 18.70 \text{ eV} = 1.96 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

This verifies that the photon energy is **1.96 eV**.

(b) The wavelength corresponding to this energy is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{1.96 \text{ eV}} = 633 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

This confirms that the wavelength is **633 nm**, which is the characteristic red light of helium-neon lasers.

(c) For a direct transition from the metastable state to the ground state:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = 20.66 \text{ eV} - 0 \text{ eV} = 20.66 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The wavelength is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{20.66 \text{ eV}} = 60.0 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

The wavelength emitted is **60.0 nm**, which is in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region.

**Discussion**

The 633 nm red light from the neon transition is what makes helium-neon lasers produce their characteristic red beam, which is widely used in laser pointers, barcode scanners, and laboratory demonstrations. The metastable state at 20.66 eV is crucial for laser operation—its relatively long lifetime allows a population inversion to build up. The direct transition to ground state (60.0 nm) is in the UV range and is much more energetic than the visible red emission. This UV wavelength matches the energy needed to initially excite helium atoms in the He-Ne laser (as shown in Figure 10), creating a closed energy cycle. The fact that neon preferentially emits at 633 nm rather than 60 nm is due to the quantum mechanical selection rules and the availability of the intermediate energy level at 18.70 eV.

A helium-neon laser is pumped by electric discharge. What wavelength electromagnetic radiation would be needed to pump it? See [[Figure 10]](#Figure10) for energy-level information.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 10]](#Figure10), we can see that helium atoms need to be excited from the ground state (0 eV) to the first metastable state at 20.61 eV. We'll use the relationship between photon energy and wavelength: $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$ or equivalently $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} $$ , where we can use the convenient form $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ .

**Solution**

The energy required to pump helium from its ground state to the metastable state is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = 20.61 \text{ eV} - 0 \text{ eV} = 20.61 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation with this energy is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{20.61 \text{ eV}} = 60.2 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This wavelength of 60.2 nm is in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, far below the visible range (400–700 nm). In practice, helium-neon lasers use electrical discharge rather than optical pumping because it's more practical to excite helium atoms through collisions with electrons in the discharge rather than trying to produce intense EUV radiation. Once the helium atoms are excited to their metastable state, they transfer energy to neon atoms through collisions, which is why helium-neon lasers work so efficiently. The laser output at 633 nm (red light) comes from the neon atoms, not the helium.

Ruby lasers have chromium atoms doped in an aluminum oxide crystal. The energy level diagram for chromium in a ruby is shown in [[Figure 17]](#Figure17). What wavelength is emitted by a ruby laser?

![The figure shows energy levels of chromium atoms in an aluminum oxide crystal. Ground state is at zero point zero electron volts, first metastable state is at one point seventy nine electron volts, second state is at two point three electron volts, and the third state is at three point zero electron volts.](../resources/Figure_30_05_16.jpg "Chromium atoms in an aluminum oxide crystal have these energy levels, one of which is metastable. This is the basis of a ruby laser. Visible light can pump the atom into an excited state above the metastable state to achieve a population inversion.")
{: #Figure17}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 17]](#Figure17), we can see that the ruby laser operates by transitions from the metastable state at 1.79 eV down to the ground state at 0.0 eV. The wavelength of the emitted photon can be calculated using $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} $$ , where $$ E = 1.79 \text{ eV} $$ is the energy difference and $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ .

**Solution**

The energy of the laser transition is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = 1.79 \text{ eV} - 0.0 \text{ eV} = 1.79 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The wavelength of the emitted radiation is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{1.79 \text{ eV} } = 693 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

The ruby laser emits light with a wavelength of **693 nm**.

**Discussion**

This wavelength of 693 nm is in the deep red portion of the visible spectrum, which is why ruby lasers produce a characteristic red beam. Ruby was the material used in the very first laser, built by Theodore Maiman in 1960. The chromium atoms (which give ruby its red color) are the active lasing medium. Visible light (green and blue wavelengths around 400-600 nm) from a flash lamp is absorbed to pump chromium atoms from the ground state to higher excited states at 2.3 eV and 3.0 eV. These atoms quickly relax non-radiatively to the metastable state at 1.79 eV, where they remain for a relatively long time (on the order of milliseconds). This allows a population inversion to build up. When stimulated emission begins, all the stored energy is released coherently as intense red light at 693 nm. Ruby lasers typically operate in pulsed mode rather than continuously because it's difficult to maintain a population inversion continuously. Despite being the first type of laser ever built, ruby lasers are still used today in applications such as holography, tattoo removal, and as pump sources for other lasers.

(a) What energy photons can pump chromium atoms in a ruby laser from the ground state to its second and third excited states? (b) What are the wavelengths of these photons? Verify that they are in the visible part of the spectrum.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 17]](#Figure17), we can identify the energy levels of chromium in aluminum oxide: ground state at 0.0 eV, first metastable state at 1.79 eV, second excited state at 2.3 eV, and third excited state at 3.0 eV. For part (a), we need the energy differences from the ground state to the second and third excited states. For part (b), we'll use $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} $$ with $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ to find the wavelengths and verify they fall within the visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm).

**Solution**

(a) The energy required to excite chromium from the ground state to the second excited state is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_2 = 2.3 \text{ eV} - 0.0 \text{ eV} = 2.3 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The energy required to excite chromium from the ground state to the third excited state is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_3 = 3.0 \text{ eV} - 0.0 \text{ eV} = 3.0 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

(b) The wavelength corresponding to the 2.3 eV photon is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_2 = \frac{hc}{E_2} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{2.3 \text{ eV}} = 539 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

This is in the green portion of the visible spectrum.

The wavelength corresponding to the 3.0 eV photon is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_3 = \frac{hc}{E_3} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{3.0 \text{ eV}} = 413 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

This is in the violet portion of the visible spectrum.

Both wavelengths fall within the visible range of approximately 400–700 nm, confirming that visible light can be used to optically pump a ruby laser.

**Discussion**

This is why ruby lasers can be pumped with visible light, typically using intense white light from a flash lamp. The chromium atoms absorb the green and violet/blue components of the white light, becoming excited to the higher energy states. They then quickly relax to the metastable state at 1.79 eV through non-radiative transitions. Once a population inversion is achieved in the metastable state, stimulated emission produces the characteristic red laser light at 693 nm (from the 1.79 eV transition back to ground state). The ability to pump with visible light makes ruby lasers relatively practical compared to systems requiring UV pumping. The green (539 nm) absorption is particularly strong, which is why ruby crystals appear red—they absorb the green light and reflect/transmit the red.

Some of the most powerful lasers are based on the energy levels of neodymium in solids, such as glass, as shown in [[Figure 18]](#Figure18). (a) What average wavelength light can pump the neodymium into the levels above its metastable state? (b) Verify that the 1.17 eV transition produces  $$1.06 \text{μm} $$

![The figure shows different energy levels of neodymium atoms in glass. The ground state is at zero electron volts, first state is at zero point five zero electron volts, the metastable second state is at one point sixty seven electron volts, and the group state levels above metastable second are at two point one electron volts. The photons release one point seventeen electron volts at wavelength of one point zero six micro meters while coming from the metastable second state to first state.](../resources/Figure_30_05_17.jpg "Neodymium atoms in glass have these energy levels, one of which is metastable. The group of levels above the metastable state is convenient for achieving a population inversion, since photons of many different energies can be absorbed by atoms in the ground state.")
{: #Figure18}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 18]](#Figure18), we see that neodymium has energy levels at 0 eV (ground state), 0.50 eV, 1.67 eV (metastable state), and a group of levels around 2.1 eV. For part (a), we need the energy to pump atoms from ground state (0 eV) to the group above the metastable state (2.1 eV), then calculate the wavelength using $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} $$ . For part (b), we verify that the 1.17 eV transition (from 1.67 eV metastable state to 0.50 eV first excited state) produces 1.06 μm radiation using $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ .

**Solution**

(a) The average energy required to pump neodymium from ground state to the levels above the metastable state is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = 2.1 \text{ eV} - 0 \text{ eV} = 2.1 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The wavelength of pump light is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{2.1 \text{ eV}} = 590 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

The average pump wavelength is **590 nm**, which is in the yellow-orange region of the spectrum.

(b) The laser transition is from the metastable state at 1.67 eV down to the first excited state at 0.50 eV:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = 1.67 \text{ eV} - 0.50 \text{ eV} = 1.17 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The wavelength is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{1.17 \text{ eV}} = 1060 \text{ nm} = 1.06 \text{ μm} $$
</div>

This verifies that the 1.17 eV transition produces **1.06 μm** radiation.

**Discussion**

Neodymium lasers (Nd:YAG or Nd:glass) are among the most powerful and versatile lasers available. The 1.06 μm wavelength is in the near-infrared, just beyond the visible red end of the spectrum. This makes the beam invisible to the human eye, which is both an advantage (no visible glare) and a safety concern (operators cannot see the beam). Neodymium lasers are widely used in materials processing (cutting, welding, marking), medical procedures (surgery, dentistry, dermatology), military applications (range finding, target designation), and scientific research. The pump wavelength of 590 nm (yellow-orange) is convenient because it can be provided by flashlamps or by laser diodes. The "group of levels" around 2.1 eV is particularly advantageous because atoms can be pumped to any of several closely-spaced levels, making the laser less sensitive to the exact pump wavelength—this is called broadband pumping. After being pumped to these upper levels, atoms quickly relax non-radiatively to the metastable state at 1.67 eV, where they accumulate to create a population inversion. The lasing transition brings atoms down to 0.50 eV, from which they quickly relax to the ground state, ready to be pumped again. This four-level laser scheme is very efficient and allows continuous operation at high power levels. Neodymium lasers can be Q-switched or mode-locked to produce extremely short, intense pulses, making them valuable for applications requiring precise energy delivery in very short time intervals.
