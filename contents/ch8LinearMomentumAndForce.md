### Linear Momentum

The scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people’s
intuitive understanding of momentum: a large, fast-moving object has greater
momentum than a smaller, slower object. **Linear momentum** is defined as the
product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear
momentum is expressed as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{p}=m\vb{v}. $$
</div>

Momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass and also its velocity.
Thus the greater an object’s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its
momentum. Momentum $$ \vb{p} $$ is a vector having the same direction as the
velocity $$ \vb{v} $$. The SI unit for momentum is $$ \kg · \ms $$.

 $$ \vb{p}=m\vb{v}. $$

<div class="title">
Calculating Momentum: A Football Player and a Football
</div>
(a) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s.
(b) Compare the player’s momentum with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a speed of 25.0 m/s.

**Strategy**

No information is given regarding direction, and so we can calculate only the
magnitude of the momentum, $$ p $$. (As usual, a symbol that is in italics is a
magnitude, whereas one that is italicized, boldfaced, and has an arrow is a
vector.) In both parts of this example, the magnitude of momentum can be
calculated directly from the definition of momentum given in the equation, which
becomes

<div class="equation">
 $$ p=mv $$
</div>
when only magnitudes are considered.

**Solution for (a)**

To determine the momentum of the player, substitute the known values for the
player’s mass and speed into the equation.

<div class="equation">
 $$ p_{\text{player}}=\left(110 \kg \right)\left(8.00  \ms \right)=880 \kg · \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

To determine the momentum of the ball, substitute the known values for the
ball’s mass and speed into the equation.

<div class="equation">
 $$ p_{\text{ball}}=\left(0.410 \kg \right)\left(25.0  \ms \right)=10.3 \kg · \ms $$
</div>
The ratio of the player’s momentum to that of the ball is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ p_{\text{player}}}{ p_{\text{ball}}}=\frac{880}{10.3}=85.9 . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Thus
the momentum of the player is much greater than the momentum of the football, as
you might guess. As a result, the player’s motion is only slightly affected if
he catches the ball. We shall quantify what happens in such collisions in terms
of momentum in later sections.

</div>

### Momentum and Newton’s Second Law

The importance of momentum, unlike the importance of energy, was recognized
early in the development of classical physics. Momentum was deemed so important
that it was called the “quantity of motion.” Newton actually stated his **second
law of motion** in terms of momentum:
The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the
time over which it changes. Using symbols, this law is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}, $$
</div>

where $$ \vb{F}\_{\text{net}} $$ is the net external force, $$ \Delta \vb{p} $$
is the change in momentum, and $$ \Delta t $$ is the change in time.

<div class="title">
Newton’s Second Law of Motion in Terms of Momentum
</div>
The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t} $$
</div>
</div>

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Making Connections: Force and Momentum
</div>
Force and momentum are intimately related. Force acting over time can change momentum, and Newton’s second law of motion, can be stated in its most broadly applicable form in terms of momentum. Momentum continues to be a key concept in the study of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics.

</div>

This statement of Newton’s second law of motion includes the more familiar $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$ as a special case. We can derive this form as
follows. First, note that the change in momentum $$ \Delta \vb{p} $$ is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \vb{p}=\Delta \left(m\vb{v}\right). $$
</div>

If the mass of the system is constant, then

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \left(m\vb{v}\right)=m\Delta \vb{v}. $$
</div>

So that for constant mass, Newton’s second law of motion becomes

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}=\frac{m\Delta \vb{v}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>

Because $$ \frac{ \Delta \vb{v}}{\Delta t}=\vb{a} $$, we get the familiar
equation

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$
</div>

_when the mass of the system is constant_.

Newton’s second law of motion stated in terms of momentum is more generally
applicable because it can be applied to systems where the mass is changing, such
as rockets, as well as to systems of constant mass. We will consider systems
with varying mass in some detail**;** however, the relationship between momentum
and force remains useful when mass is constant, such as in the following
example.

<div class="example" id="exampleTennis" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Force: Venus Williams’ Racquet
</div>
During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in
a premier women’s match, reaching a speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average
force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by Venus Williams’ racquet, assuming
that the ball’s speed just after impact is 58 m/s, that the initial horizontal
component of the velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained
in contact with the racquet for 5.0 ms (milliseconds)?

**Strategy**

This problem involves only one dimension because the ball starts from having no
horizontal velocity component before impact. Newton’s second law stated in terms
of momentum is then written as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>
As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta p=m\Delta v=m\left(v_{f}-v_{i}\right). $$
</div>
In this example, the velocity just after impact and the change in time are
given; thus, once $$ \Delta p $$ is calculated,
$$ F_{\text{net}}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $$ can be used to find
the force.

**Solution**

To determine the change in momentum, substitute the values for the initial and
final velocities into the equation above.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta p &=& m \left( v_{f} - v_{i} \right)\\
\Delta p &=& \left(0.057 \kg \right)\left(58  \ms -0 \ms \right)\\
\Delta p &=& 3.306 \kg · \ms \approx 3.3 \kg · \ms
\end{array} $$
</div>
Now the magnitude of the net external force can determined by
using $$ F_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta t} $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}}&=& \frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{3.306 \kg \cdot  \ms }{5.0\times 10^{-3}s}\\
F_{\text{net}}&=& 661 \N \approx 660  \text{N,}
\end{array} $$
</div>
where we have retained only two significant figures in the final step.

**Discussion**

This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams’ racquet on the
tennis ball during its brief impact (note that the ball also experienced the
0.56-N force of gravity, but that force was not due to the racquet). This
problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using $$ F_{\text{net}}=ma $$, but one additional step would be required compared with
the strategy used in this example.

</div>

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) Calculate the momentum of a 2000-kg elephant charging a hunter at a speed of $$ 7.50  \ms $$.

(b) Compare the elephant's momentum with the momentum of a 0.0400-kg
tranquilizer dart fired at a speed of $$ 600 \ms $$.

(c) What is the momentum of the 90.0-kg hunter running at $$ 7.40 \ms $$ after
missing the elephant?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This problem applies the definition of linear momentum $$ p = mv $$ to calculate the momentum of each object. For part (b), we compare the momenta by finding their ratio.

**Solution for (a)**

Using the definition of momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{elephant}} = m_{\text{elephant}} v\_{\text{elephant}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ p\_{\text{elephant}} = (2000 \kg)(7.50 \ms) = 1.50 \times 10^{4} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

First, calculate the dart's momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{dart}} = m_{\text{dart}} v\_{\text{dart}} = (0.0400 \kg)(600 \ms) = 24.0 \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

Now find the ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{p_{\text{elephant}}}{p_{\text{dart}}} = \frac{1.50 \times 10^{4} \kg \cdot \ms}{24.0 \kg \cdot \ms} = 625 $$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{hunter}} = m_{\text{hunter}} v\_{\text{hunter}} = (90.0 \kg)(7.40 \ms) = 6.66 \times 10^{2} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Despite the dart traveling 80 times faster than the elephant, the elephant's enormous mass (50,000 times the dart's mass) results in a momentum 625 times larger. This illustrates why momentum depends on both mass and velocity. The hunter's momentum is much smaller than the elephant's, explaining why the hunter wisely chose to run!

**Answer**

(a) The elephant's momentum is **1.50 × 10⁴ kg·m/s**.

(b) The elephant's momentum is **625 times** greater than the dart's momentum.

(c) The hunter's momentum is **666 kg·m/s** (or 6.66 × 10² kg·m/s).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the mass of a large ship that has a momentum of $$ 1.60 \times 10^{9}\kg · \ms $$,
when the ship is moving at a speed of $$ 48.0 \text{km/h} $$ ?

(b) Compare the ship's momentum to the momentum of a 1100-kg artillery shell
fired at a speed of $$ 1200 \ms $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the definition of momentum $$ p = mv $$ and solve for mass. We must first convert the speed from km/h to m/s. For part (b), we calculate the shell's momentum and find the ratio.

**Solution for (a)**

First, convert the ship's speed to SI units:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = 48.0 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{1000 \m}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \s} = 13.33 \ms $$
</div>

Using $$ p = mv $$ and solving for mass:

<div class="equation">
$$ m = \frac{p}{v} = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{9} \kg \cdot \ms}{13.33 \ms} = 1.20 \times 10^{8} \kg $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Calculate the artillery shell's momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{shell}} = m_{\text{shell}} v\_{\text{shell}} = (1100 \kg)(1200 \ms) = 1.32 \times 10^{6} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

Find the ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{p_{\text{ship}}}{p_{\text{shell}}} = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{9} \kg \cdot \ms}{1.32 \times 10^{6} \kg \cdot \ms} = 1.21 \times 10^{3} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Even though the artillery shell travels at supersonic speed (about Mach 3.5), the ship's enormous mass gives it over 1000 times more momentum. This explains why large ships require great distances and time to stop or change direction—their massive momentum must be overcome by relatively small forces from their propulsion systems.

**Answer**

(a) The ship's mass is **1.20 × 10⁸ kg** (120 million kilograms, or about 120,000 metric tons).

(b) The ship's momentum is approximately **1210 times** (or 1.21 × 10³ times) greater than the artillery shell's momentum.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) At what speed would a $$ 2.00 \times 10^{4}\text{-kg} $$
airplane have to fly to have a momentum of $$ 1.60 \times 10^{9}\kg · \ms  $$ (the same as the ship's momentum in the problem above)?

(b) What is the plane's momentum when it is taking off at a speed of $$ 60.0 \ms $$

?

(c) If the ship is an aircraft carrier that launches these airplanes with a
catapult, discuss the implications of your answer to (b) as it relates to recoil
effects of the catapult on the ship.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use $$ p = mv $$ and solve for velocity. For part (b), we calculate the plane's actual momentum during takeoff. For part (c), we apply conservation of momentum to find the ship's recoil velocity.

**Solution for (a)**

Using $$ p = mv $$ and solving for velocity:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{p}{m} = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{9} \kg \cdot \ms}{2.00 \times 10^{4} \kg} = 8.00 \times 10^{4} \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{plane}} = m_{\text{plane}} v_{\text{takeoff}} = (2.00 \times 10^{4} \kg)(60.0 \ms) = 1.20 \times 10^{6} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

By conservation of momentum, when the catapult launches the plane forward, the ship recoils backward. The ship's mass from the previous problem is $$ 1.20 \times 10^{8} \kg $$.

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{ship}} v_{\text{recoil}} = -p_{\text{plane}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{\text{recoil}} = \frac{-1.20 \times 10^{6} \kg \cdot \ms}{1.20 \times 10^{8} \kg} = -0.0100 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The airplane's momentum at takeoff is about 1300 times smaller than the ship's momentum. Because the ship is 6000 times more massive than the plane, the recoil effect is imperceptible. This demonstrates why aircraft carriers can launch planes without noticeable movement, making them stable platforms for flight operations.

**Answer**

(a) The airplane would need to fly at **8.00 × 10⁴ m/s** (80 km/s), which is about 235 times the speed of sound—clearly impossible for conventional aircraft.

(b) The plane's momentum at takeoff is **1.20 × 10⁶ kg·m/s**.

(c) The ship recoils at only **0.0100 m/s** (1 cm/s) backward, which is negligible and demonstrates why aircraft carriers remain stable platforms for flight operations.

(a) What is the momentum of a garbage truck that is $$ 1.20 \times 10^{4}\kg $$
and is moving at $$ 10.0  \ms $$ ?

(b) At what speed would an 8.00-kg trash can have the same momentum as the
truck?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we apply the definition of momentum $$ p = mv $$. For part (b), we set the trash can's momentum equal to the truck's momentum and solve for the required velocity.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{\text{truck}} = m_{\text{truck}} v_{\text{truck}} = (1.20 \times 10^{4} \kg)(10.0 \ms) = 1.20 \times 10^{5} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

For equal momenta: $$ p_{\text{can}} = p_{\text{truck}} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{can}} v_{\text{can}} = 1.20 \times 10^{5} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{\text{can}} = \frac{1.20 \times 10^{5} \kg \cdot \ms}{8.00 \kg} = 1.50 \times 10^{4} \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This speed is about 44 times the speed of sound and roughly half of Earth's escape velocity! The mass ratio between the truck and trash can is 1500:1, so the trash can would need to travel 1500 times faster than the truck to have equal momentum. This dramatically illustrates how mass and velocity contribute equally to momentum—doubling either one doubles the momentum.

**Answer**

(a) The garbage truck's momentum is **1.20 × 10⁵ kg·m/s**.

(b) The trash can would need to travel at **1.50 × 10⁴ m/s** (15 km/s, or about 54,000 km/h) to have the same momentum as the garbage truck.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A runaway train car that has a mass of 15 000 kg travels at a speed of $$ 5.4  \ms $$
down a track. Compute the time required for a force of 1500 N to bring the car
to rest.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We use Newton's second law in terms of momentum: $$ F_{\text{net}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $$. The train must lose all its momentum, so we calculate the initial momentum and then find the time required for the given force to produce this change in momentum.

**Solution**

First, calculate the initial momentum of the train car:

<div class="equation">
$$ p_{i} = mv = (15000 \kg)(5.4 \ms) = 81000 \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

The final momentum is zero (the car comes to rest), so the change in momentum is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta p = p_{f} - p_{i} = 0 - 81000 \kg \cdot \ms = -81000 \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

Using Newton's second law in terms of momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $$
</div>

The force opposing the motion is negative (in the direction opposite to motion), so:

<div class="equation">
$$ -1500 \N = \frac{-81000 \kg \cdot \ms}{\Delta t} $$
</div>

Solving for time:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta t = \frac{81000 \kg \cdot \ms}{1500 \N} = 54 \s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Nearly a minute is needed to stop the train car, which makes sense given its large mass and modest braking force. The ratio of momentum to force gives time, showing why heavy objects require either larger forces or longer times to stop. This is why trains have long stopping distances—even with substantial braking forces, their enormous momentum takes considerable time to reduce to zero.

**Answer**

The time required to bring the train car to rest is **54 s** (54 seconds).

The mass of Earth is $$ 5.972 \times {10}^{24}\kg $$
and its orbital radius is an average of $$ 1.496 \times {10}^{11}\m $$.
Calculate its linear momentum.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

To find Earth's linear momentum, we need its orbital velocity. Earth travels in a nearly circular orbit around the Sun, completing one orbit in one year. We can calculate the orbital velocity from the circumference of the orbit divided by the orbital period, then apply $$ p = mv $$.

**Solution**

First, calculate the circumference of Earth's orbit:

<div class="equation">
$$ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi (1.496 \times 10^{11} \m) = 9.40 \times 10^{11} \m $$
</div>

Convert one year to seconds:

<div class="equation">
$$ T = 1 \text{ year} = 365.25 \text{ days} \times 24 \frac{\text{h}}{\text{day}} \times 3600 \frac{\s}{\text{h}} = 3.156 \times 10^{7} \s $$
</div>

Calculate Earth's orbital velocity:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{C}{T} = \frac{9.40 \times 10^{11} \m}{3.156 \times 10^{7} \s} = 2.98 \times 10^{4} \ms $$
</div>

Now calculate Earth's momentum:

<div class="equation">
$$ p = mv = (5.972 \times 10^{24} \kg)(2.98 \times 10^{4} \ms) = 1.78 \times 10^{29} \kg \cdot \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is an enormous momentum—about $$ 10^{24} $$ times larger than the ship's momentum from earlier problems. Earth's orbital velocity of about 30 km/s (roughly 108,000 km/h) combined with its massive $$ 6 \times 10^{24} \kg $$ mass produces this immense momentum. Despite this huge momentum, Earth's orbit is stable because the Sun's gravitational force continuously provides the centripetal acceleration needed to change the direction of this momentum without changing its magnitude.

**Answer**

The linear momentum of Earth in its orbit around the Sun is **1.78 × 10²⁹ kg·m/s**.
