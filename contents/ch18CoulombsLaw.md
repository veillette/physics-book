Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century, the main features of
the **electrostatic force**—the existence of two types of charge, the
observation that like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and the decrease of
force with distance—were eventually refined, and expressed as a mathematical
formula. The mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called **Coulomb’s law** after the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806), who
performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it.

Coulomb’s Law
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}}. $$
</div>
Coulomb’s law calculates the *magnitude* of the force  $$F $$ between two point charges,  $${q}_{1} $$ and  $${q}_{2} $$, separated by a distance  $$r $$ .
 In SI units, the constant  $$k $$  is equal to

<div class="equation" >
 $$k= 8.988 \times 10^{9} \frac{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}{ {\text{C}}^{2}}\approx  8.99 \times 10^{9} \frac{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}{ {\text{C}}^{2}}. $$
</div>
The electrostatic force is a vector quantity and is expressed in units of newtons. The force is understood to be along the line joining the two charges. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

</div>

Although the formula for Coulomb’s law is simple, it was no mean task to prove
it. The experiments Coulomb did, with the primitive equipment then available,
were difficult. Modern experiments have verified Coulomb’s law to great
precision. For example, it has been shown that the force is inversely
proportional to distance between two objects squared $$\left(F\propto 1/{r}^{2}\right) $$ to an accuracy of 1 part in $$ 10^{16} $$ . No exceptions
have ever been found, even at the small distances within the atom.

How Strong is the Coulomb Force Relative to the Gravitational Force?
</div>
Compare the electrostatic force between an electron and proton separated by  $$ 0.530 \times 10^{-10}  \text{m} $$
 with the gravitational force between them. This distance is their average separation in a hydrogen atom.

**Strategy**

To compare the two forces, we first compute the electrostatic force using
Coulomb’s law, $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}} $$ . We then calculate
the gravitational force using Newton’s universal law of gravitation. Finally, we
take a ratio to see how the forces compare in magnitude.

**Solution**

Entering the given and known information about the charges and separation of the
electron and proton into the expression of Coulomb’s law yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{} F=\left( 8.99 \times 10^{9} \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{C}}^{2}\right)×\frac{\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)}{ { \left(0.530 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}\right)}^{2}}\\ \end{array} $$ 
</div>
Thus the Coulomb force is

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=8.19 \times 10^{-8} \text{N}. $$
</div>
The charges are opposite in sign, so this is an attractive force. This is a very large force for an electron—it would cause an acceleration of  $$ 8.99 \times 10^{22}  \text{m}/{\text{s}}^{2} $$
(verification is left as an end-of-section problem). The magnitude of the gravitational force is given by Newton’s law of gravitation as:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{G}=G\frac{mM}{ {r}^{2}}, $$
</div>
where  $$G= 6.67 \times 10^{-11}  \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{kg}}^{2} $$ .
 Here  $$m $$  and  $$M $$
 represent the electron and proton masses, which can be found in the appendices. Entering values for the knowns yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{G}=\left(6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{kg}}^{2}\right)×\frac{\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right)\left(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{kg}\right)}{ {\left(0.530 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}\right)}^{2}}=3.61 \times 10^{-47} \text{N} $$
</div>
This is also an attractive force, although it is traditionally shown as positive since gravitational force is always attractive. The ratio of the magnitude of the electrostatic force to gravitational force in this case is, thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{F}{ {F}_{G}}= 2.27  \times 10^{39}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is a remarkably large ratio! Note that this will be the ratio of
electrostatic force to gravitational force for an electron and a proton at any
distance (taking the ratio before entering numerical values shows that the
distance cancels). This ratio gives some indication of just how much larger the
Coulomb force is than the gravitational force between two of the most common
particles in nature.

</div>

As the example implies, gravitational force is completely negligible on a small
scale, where the interactions of individual charged particles are important. On
a large scale, such as between the Earth and a person, the reverse is true. Most
objects are nearly electrically neutral, and so attractive and repulsive **Coulomb forces** nearly cancel. Gravitational force on a large scale dominates
interactions between large objects because it is always attractive, while
Coulomb forces tend to cancel.

### Section Summary

- Frenchman Charles Coulomb was the first to publish the mathematical equation
  that describes the electrostatic force between two objects.
- Coulomb’s law gives the magnitude of the force between point charges. It is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}}, $$
  </div>

where $${q}_{1} $$ and $${q}_{2} $$ are two point charges separated by a
distance $$r $$ , and $$k\approx 8.99 \times 10^{9} \text{N}·{\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{C}}^{2} $$

- This Coulomb force is extremely basic, since most charges are due to
  point-like particles. It is responsible for all electrostatic effects and
  underlies most macroscopic forces.
- The Coulomb force is extraordinarily strong compared with the gravitational
  force, another basic force—but unlike gravitational force it can cancel, since
  it can be either attractive or repulsive.
- The electrostatic force between two subatomic particles is far greater than
  the gravitational force between the same two particles.

What is the repulsive force between two pith balls that are 8.00 cm apart and have equal charges of  - 30.0 nC?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Two charged objects exert a force on each other according to Coulomb's law. Since both pith balls have the same negative charge, they will repel each other. We can calculate the magnitude of this force using $$F = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r^2}$$, where $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$, $$q_1 = q_2 = -30.0 \text{ nC}$$, and $$r = 8.00 \text{ cm}$$.

**Solution**

Convert the given values to SI units:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = q_2 = -30.0 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$r = 8.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$$
</div>

Apply Coulomb's law:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = \left(8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\right) \frac{\mid (-30.0 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C})(-30.0 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}) \mid}{(8.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = \left(8.99 \times 10^9\right) \frac{9.00 \times 10^{-16}}{6.40 \times 10^{-3}} \text{ N}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = 1.26 \times 10^{-3} \text{ N} = 1.26 \text{ mN}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The repulsive force between the two pith balls is 1.26 × 10⁻³ N, or 1.26 millinewtons. This is a small force by everyday standards but is significant for lightweight pith balls. Since both charges are negative, the force is repulsive, pushing the balls apart. The magnitude of the force depends on the square of the distance, so doubling the separation would reduce the force to one-quarter of this value.

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use Coulomb's law to calculate the force between the two charges, treating them as point charges. The charges have opposite signs, so the force will be attractive. For part (b), we consider how charge distribution affects the result.

**Solution**

**(a)** Convert the given values to SI units:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = 0.700 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$

 $$F = 2.62 \times 10^{-1} \text{ N} = 0.262 \text{ N} \approx 0.263 \text{ N}$$
</div>

**(b)** If the charges are distributed over some area rather than being concentrated at points, the charge distribution would be affected by the presence of the opposite charge. The side of each object closest to the oppositely charged object would accumulate more charge due to polarization and redistribution. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the concentration of charge on the near side would experience a stronger attractive force than if the charge were uniformly distributed. This effect would increase the net force beyond the 0.263 N calculated using the point charge approximation.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The attractive force is 0.263 N, which is substantial—roughly equivalent to the weight of a 27-gram object. This demonstrates that even microcoulomb charges can produce significant forces at centimeter-scale separations.

Part (b): The point charge approximation is valid when the separation distance is much larger than the size of the charged objects. When objects have finite size, induced polarization causes charge redistribution, with opposite charges concentrating on the near sides. This increases the force because these concentrated charges are closer together than the average separation distance would suggest. Real objects would therefore experience a somewhat stronger force than our point charge calculation predicts.

Two point charges exert a 5.00 N force on each other. What will the force become if the distance between them is increased by a factor of three?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance: $$F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$. If the distance increases by a factor of 3, we can find the new force by examining how the force scales with distance.

**Solution**

The initial force is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_1 = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_1^2} = 5.00 \text{ N}$$
</div>

The new distance is:

<div class="equation">
 $$r_2 = 3r_1$$
</div>

The new force is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_2 = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_2^2} = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{(3r_1)^2} = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{9r_1^2}$$
</div>

Taking the ratio:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{9r_1^2}}{k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_1^2}} = \frac{1}{9}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_2 = \frac{F_1}{9} = \frac{5.00 \text{ N}}{9} = 0.556 \text{ N}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

When the distance between the charges is tripled, the force decreases to one-ninth of its original value, becoming 0.556 N. This illustrates the inverse square law nature of Coulomb's force. The force decreases rapidly with increasing distance—tripling the distance reduces the force by a factor of 9, quadrupling the distance would reduce it by a factor of 16, and so on. This inverse square relationship is a fundamental characteristic shared by both electrostatic and gravitational forces.

Two point charges are brought closer together, increasing the force between them by a factor of 25. By what factor was their separation decreased?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Since the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance ($$F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$), if the force increases by a certain factor, we can determine how the distance must have changed by examining the inverse square relationship.

**Solution**

Let the initial force and distance be $$F_1$$ and $$r_1$$, and the final force and distance be $$F_2$$ and $$r_2$$.

From Coulomb's law:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_1 = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_1^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F_2 = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_2^2}$$
</div>

We're told that $$F_2 = 25F_1$$. Taking the ratio:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_2^2}}{k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r_1^2}} = \frac{r_1^2}{r_2^2} = 25$$
</div>

Solving for the ratio of distances:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{r_1^2}{r_2^2} = 25$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \sqrt{25} = 5$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
 $$r_2 = \frac{r_1}{5}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The separation decreased by a factor of 5. This result makes sense with the inverse square law: if the distance is reduced by a factor of 5, the force increases by a factor of 5² = 25. This demonstrates the sensitive dependence of electrostatic force on distance. Bringing charges closer together even slightly can dramatically increase the force between them, which is why static electricity can produce surprisingly strong effects when charged objects come into close proximity.

How far apart must two point charges of 75.0 nC (typical of static electricity) be to have a force of 1.00 N between them?

**Strategy**

We need to find the separation distance $$r$$ that produces a force of 1.00 N between two charges of 75.0 nC each. We can rearrange Coulomb's law to solve for $$r$$: $$r = \sqrt{\frac{k\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{F}}$$.

**Discussion**

The two charges must be separated by 7.11 mm to produce a force of 1.00 N. This is a remarkably small separation for such a large force. One newton is approximately the weight of a 100-gram object, which is substantial. This demonstrates that typical static electricity charges (nanocoulombs) can produce significant forces when objects are brought within millimeter distances of each other.

**Discussion**

The force between two 1-coulomb charges separated by 1 km is approximately 9000 N, which is enormous! To put this in perspective, this force is roughly equivalent to the weight of a 900-kilogram object (about the weight of a small car). This demonstrates that 1 coulomb is an extraordinarily large amount of charge.

In everyday static electricity, charges are typically measured in nanocoulombs (10⁻⁹ C) or microcoulombs (10⁻⁶ C)—millions or billions of times smaller than 1 coulomb. It would be essentially impossible to accumulate 1 coulomb of excess charge on an object because the repulsive forces would be so large that the charge would immediately dissipate through any available path, including ionizing the air itself to create a conducting path. This problem helps us appreciate why the coulomb is such a large unit for measuring static charge.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The test charge experiences forces from both charges. Since all three charges are positive, both forces will be repulsive. We calculate each force using Coulomb's law, then find the net force by considering their directions. The test charge is at the midpoint, so it's 5 cm from each charge.

**Solution**

Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_{\text{test}} = +2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$

<div class="equation">

 $$F_1 = k\frac{q_1 q_{\text{test}}}{r_1^2} = (8.99 \times 10^9) \frac{(6 \times 10^{-6})(2 \times 10^{-6})}{(5.0 \times 10^{-2})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F_1 = (8.99 \times 10^9) \frac{12 \times 10^{-12}}{2.5 \times 10^{-3}} = 43.2 \text{ N}$$
</div>

Calculate the force from the $$+4 \mu\text{C}$$ charge:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_2 = k\frac{q_2 q_{\text{test}}}{r_2^2} = (8.99 \times 10^9) \frac{(4 \times 10^{-6})(2 \times 10^{-6})}{(5.0 \times 10^{-2})^2}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$F_2 = (8.99 \times 10^9) \frac{8 \times 10^{-12}}{2.5 \times 10^{-3}} = 28.8 \text{ N}$$

The forces point in opposite directions. Let's define the direction toward the $$+4 \mu\text{C}$$ charge as positive. Then $$F_1$$ pushes the test charge away from the $$+6 \mu\text{C}$$ charge (positive direction) and $$F_2$$ pushes it away from the $$+4 \mu\text{C}$$ charge (negative direction).

Net force:

The magnitude of the net force on the test charge is 14.4 N, directed away from the larger $$+6 \mu\text{C}$$ charge. This makes physical sense: both charges repel the positive test charge, but the stronger repulsion from the larger charge dominates. The test charge would be pushed toward the smaller charge side if released. This demonstrates how vector addition is crucial in electrostatics—we must account for both magnitude and direction of forces. If the test charge were not at the midpoint, the calculation would be more complex, but the principle remains the same.

Bare free charges do not remain stationary when close together. To illustrate this, calculate the acceleration of two isolated protons separated by 2.00 nm (a typical distance between gas atoms). Explicitly show how you follow the steps in the Problem-Solving Strategy for electrostatics.

**Strategy**

We follow the problem-solving strategy for electrostatics:
1. Identify the charges and their separation distance
2. Calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's law
3. Use Newton's second law ($$F = ma$$) to find the acceleration
4. Check that the result is reasonable

**Solution**

**Step 1:** Identify the given information.

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = q_2 = e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$ (charge of a proton)
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$r = 2.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} = 2.00 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$$ (mass of a proton)

<div class="equation">
 $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \approx 9.00 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's law.

<div class="equation">
 $$F = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r^2} = k\frac{e^2}{r^2}$$
</div>

**Step 3:** Use Newton's second law to find acceleration.

<div class="equation">
 $$F = ma \Rightarrow a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{ke^2}{mr^2}$$
</div>

**Step 4:** Substitute numerical values.

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{(9.00 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})^2}{(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg})(2.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^2}$$

**Discussion**

The acceleration of each proton is 3.45 × 10¹⁶ m/s², which is an extraordinarily large acceleration—about 10¹⁵ times greater than Earth's gravitational acceleration! This immense acceleration demonstrates why bare charges don't remain stationary when close together. Even at a separation of 2 nm (a typical atomic spacing), the electrostatic repulsion is so strong that the protons would rapidly accelerate apart if they were truly isolated.

This result helps explain several important phenomena: (1) why atoms need electrons to neutralize the positive charge of the nucleus, (2) why it's so difficult to confine charged particles at small distances (as in nuclear fusion), and (3) why electrostatic forces dominate at the atomic scale. The fact that atoms exist at all is remarkable given these enormous forces—they require the balancing effect of the attractive force between protons and electrons.

(a) By what factor must you change the distance between two point charges to change the force between them by a factor of 10? (b) Explain how the distance can either increase or decrease by this factor and still cause a factor of 10 change in the force.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the inverse square relationship in Coulomb's law to determine what distance change produces a force change of factor 10. For part (b), we explain how both increasing and decreasing the distance by this factor can each produce a factor of 10 change in force.

**Solution**

**(a)** The electrostatic force follows the inverse square law:

<div class="equation">
 $$F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
</div>

If the force changes by a factor of 10, we have:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{r_1^2}{r_2^2} = 10$$
</div>

Taking the square root:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \sqrt{10} = 3.16 \approx 3.2$$
</div>

Therefore, the distance must change by a factor of $$\sqrt{10} \approx 3.2$$.

**(b)** The factor 3.2 can be applied in two ways:

**Case 1 - Distance increases:** If $$r_2 = 3.2 r_1$$ (distance increases by factor of 3.2):

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{r_1^2}{(3.2 r_1)^2} = \frac{1}{10.24} \approx \frac{1}{10}$$
</div>

The force decreases by a factor of 10.

**Case 2 - Distance decreases:** If $$r_2 = \frac{r_1}{3.2}$$ (distance decreases by factor of 3.2):

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{r_1^2}{(r_1/3.2)^2} = (3.2)^2 = 10.24 \approx 10$$
</div>

The force increases by a factor of 10.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The distance must change by a factor of 3.2 (or more precisely, $$\sqrt{10}$$) to change the force by a factor of 10. This arises directly from the inverse square law.

Part (b): Whether the distance increases or decreases by a factor of 3.2, the force changes by a factor of 10—but in opposite directions. Increasing the distance weakens the force (decreases it by factor of 10), while decreasing the distance strengthens it (increases it by factor of 10). This symmetry is a consequence of the mathematical form of the inverse square law. The same proportional change in distance produces the same proportional change in force magnitude, regardless of whether we're moving charges closer or farther apart.

Suppose you have a total charge  $${q}_{\text{tot}} $$
 that you can split in any manner. Once split, the separation distance is fixed. How do you split the charge to achieve the greatest force?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find how to divide the total charge $$q_{\text{tot}}$$ into two parts, $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$, such that the force between them is maximized. Let $$q_1 = x$$ and $$q_2 = q_{\text{tot}} - x$$. We'll express the force as a function of $$x$$ and find the maximum using calculus.

**Solution**

The force between the two charges is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = k\frac{\mid q_1 q_2 \mid}{r^2} = k\frac{x(q_{\text{tot}} - x)}{r^2}$$
</div>

Since $$k$$ and $$r$$ are constants, we maximize $$F$$ by maximizing the product $$f(x) = x(q_{\text{tot}} - x)$$.

Expanding:

<div class="equation">
 $$f(x) = xq_{\text{tot}} - x^2$$
</div>

Taking the derivative:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{df}{dx} = q_{\text{tot}} - 2x$$
</div>

Setting equal to zero to find the maximum:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_{\text{tot}} - 2x = 0$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{q_{\text{tot}}}{2}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{q_{\text{tot}}}{2}, \quad q_2 = \frac{q_{\text{tot}}}{2}$$
</div>

To verify this is a maximum, check the second derivative:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = -2 < 0$$
</div>

This confirms a maximum.

**Discussion**

To achieve the greatest force, split the charge equally: $$q_1 = q_2 = \frac{q_{\text{tot}}}{2}$$. This result makes intuitive sense from the symmetric nature of the product $$q_1 q_2$$—for a fixed sum, the product of two numbers is maximized when they are equal.

For example, if $$q_{\text{tot}} = 10$$ nC, splitting it as 5 nC and 5 nC gives $$q_1 q_2 = 25$$, which is larger than any unequal split (like 4 and 6, giving 24, or 3 and 7, giving 21). This principle has practical applications: to maximize electrostatic forces with a fixed amount of charge, distribute it evenly between the two objects.

(b) Discuss whether the magnitude of this charge is consistent with what is typical of static electricity.

</div>

**Strategy**

For part (a), the electrostatic repulsive force must equal the weight of the top piece of tape. We set $$F = mg$$ and solve for the charge using Coulomb's law. For part (b), we compare the result to typical static electricity charges.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$m = 10.0 \text{ mg} = 10.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ kg} = 1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg}$$

The weight of the tape:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_g = mg = (1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 9.80 \times 10^{-5} \text{ N}$$

For the tape to be supported, the electrostatic force must equal the weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_e = F_g$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{q^2}{r^2} = mg$$
</div>

Solving for $$q$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$q^2 = \frac{mgr^2}{k}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \sqrt{\frac{mgr^2}{k}} = r\sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}}$$

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
 $$q = (1.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m})\sqrt{\frac{(1.00 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)}{8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2}}$$

 $$q = (1.00 \times 10^{-2})\sqrt{1.09 \times 10^{-14}} \text{ C}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$q = (1.00 \times 10^{-2})(1.04 \times 10^{-7}) = 1.04 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}$$
</div>

**(b)** The charge is approximately 1.04 nC, which is indeed consistent with typical static electricity. Static charges commonly range from nanocoulombs to microcoulombs. The fact that such a small charge (about 1 nC) can levitate a piece of tape demonstrates the strength of electrostatic forces at small separations.

**Discussion**

Part (a): Each piece of tape must have a charge of approximately 1.04 × 10⁻⁹ C (1.04 nC) to support the 10.0 mg piece at a 1.00 cm separation. This corresponds to an excess or deficit of about $$n = q/e = (1.04 \times 10^{-9})/(1.60 \times 10^{-19}) \approx 6.5 \times 10^9$$ elementary charges, or about 6.5 billion electrons.

Part (b): This charge magnitude is entirely consistent with static electricity observations. When you pull tape from a dispenser, friction transfers electrons between the tape and the dispenser (or between layers of tape), creating charges in the nanocoulomb range. This simple demonstration with tape beautifully illustrates both the quantitative predictions of Coulomb's law and the everyday manifestations of electrostatic forces. It also shows how remarkably sensitive electrostatic forces are—a tiny fraction of the electrons in the tape being redistributed is sufficient to create observable levitation effects.

(a) Find the ratio of the electrostatic to gravitational force between two electrons. (b) What is this ratio for two protons? (c) Why is the ratio different for electrons and protons?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For both electrons and protons, we calculate the ratio of electrostatic force to gravitational force. The electrostatic force is $$F_e = k\frac{e^2}{r^2}$$ and the gravitational force is $$F_g = G\frac{m^2}{r^2}$$, where $$m$$ is the mass of the particle. The ratio will be $$\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{ke^2}{Gm^2}$$.

**Solution**

Known constants:
- $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$
- $$G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2$$

- $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$ (electron mass)
- $$m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$$ (proton mass)

**(a)** For two electrons:

</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(2.56 \times 10^{-38})}{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(8.30 \times 10^{-61})}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{2.30 \times 10^{-28}}{5.54 \times 10^{-71}} = 4.16 \times 10^{42}$$

 $$\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{2.30 \times 10^{-28}}{1.86 \times 10^{-64}} = 1.24 \times 10^{36}$$
</div>

**(c)** The ratio is different because it depends on the mass of the particles ($$\frac{1}{m^2}$$), while the electrostatic force depends on charge (which is the same for electrons and protons). Electrons have much smaller mass than protons ($$m_e \approx \frac{1}{1836} m_p$$), so the gravitational force between electrons is much weaker relative to their electrostatic force. The ratio is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, making the ratio about $$(1836)^2 \approx 3.4 \times 10^6$$ times larger for electrons than for protons.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The electrostatic force between two electrons is about 4.16 × 10⁴² times stronger than the gravitational force between them. This is an astronomically large ratio, demonstrating that gravity is utterly negligible at the atomic scale.

Part (b): For two protons, the ratio is about 1.24 × 10³⁶, which is still enormous but about a million times smaller than for electrons.

Part (c): The different ratios arise because both forces have the same distance dependence ($$1/r^2$$), and both particles have the same magnitude of charge, but they have very different masses. The electron is about 1836 times lighter than the proton, so the gravitational force is about $$(1836)^2 \approx 3.4 \times 10^6$$ times weaker for electrons, making the ratio of electrostatic to gravitational force that much larger. This illustrates why electrostatic forces completely dominate over gravity at the atomic and subatomic scales, and why we can usually ignore gravity when studying atomic and molecular phenomena.

**Discussion**

The electrostatic force between two protons equals the weight of one proton when they are separated by approximately 11.8 cm (or about 12 cm). This is a macroscopic distance, which seems surprising at first. However, this result demonstrates just how weak gravity is compared to electrostatic forces, even for such tiny particles.

Consider what this means: at atomic scales (nanometers or angstroms), the electrostatic force between protons is enormously larger than their weight. Only when the protons are separated by over 10 centimeters—billions of times their diameter—does the electrostatic repulsion diminish enough to equal the tiny gravitational force on a single proton. This calculation reinforces why gravity is completely negligible in atomic and nuclear physics, and why electrostatic forces dominate the structure of atoms and molecules.

A certain five cent coin contains 5.00 g of nickel. What fraction of the nickel atoms' electrons, removed and placed 1.00 m above it, would support the weight of this coin? The atomic mass of nickel is 58.7, and each nickel atom contains 28 electrons and 28 protons.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

If we remove $$N_{\text{removed}}$$ electrons from the coin and place them 1.00 m above it, the coin becomes positively charged and the electrons negatively charged. The attractive force between them must equal the coin's weight. We'll calculate the required charge, then determine what fraction of the coin's total electrons this represents.

**Solution**

**Step 1:** Calculate the coin's weight.

<div class="equation">
 $$w = mg = (5.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 4.90 \times 10^{-2} \text{ N}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \sqrt{\frac{wr^2}{k}} = r\sqrt{\frac{w}{k}}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$q = (1.00 \text{ m})\sqrt{\frac{4.90 \times 10^{-2} \text{ N}}{8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2}}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \sqrt{5.45 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.34 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$

**Step 3:** Calculate the number of electrons removed.

<div class="equation">
 $$N_{\text{removed}} = \frac{q}{e} = \frac{2.34 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}} = 1.46 \times 10^{13} \text{ electrons}$$
</div>

**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of electrons in the coin.

Number of moles of nickel:

<div class="equation">
 $$n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{5.00 \text{ g}}{58.7 \text{ g/mol}} = 8.52 \times 10^{-2} \text{ mol}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$N_{\text{atoms}} = n \times N_A = (8.52 \times 10^{-2})(6.02 \times 10^{23}) = 5.13 \times 10^{22} \text{ atoms}$$

Total number of electrons (28 per atom):

<div class="equation">
 $$N_{\text{total}} = 28 \times N_{\text{atoms}} = 28 \times 5.13 \times 10^{22} = 1.44 \times 10^{24} \text{ electrons}$$

**Step 5:** Calculate the fraction.

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{Fraction} = \frac{N_{\text{removed}}}{N_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.46 \times 10^{13}}{1.44 \times 10^{24}} = 1.01 \times 10^{-11} \approx 1.02 \times 10^{-11}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Only about 1.02 × 10⁻¹¹ (or roughly one part in 100 billion) of the coin's electrons need to be removed to create enough electrostatic force to support its weight at a 1-meter separation. This incredibly small fraction demonstrates the enormous strength of electrostatic forces compared to gravity.

Even though we're only removing about 14.6 trillion electrons (which sounds like a lot), this represents an utterly negligible fraction of the approximately 1.44 × 10²⁴ electrons in the coin. This calculation illustrates why matter appears electrically neutral in everyday life—even the relatively large charges involved in static electricity represent only tiny imbalances in the number of electrons and protons in an object. It also shows why electrostatic forces can easily overcome gravity for charged objects, despite charges being such small fractions of the total charge in matter.

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1(8.00 \times 10^{-6} - q_1) = 4.17 \times 10^{-12}$$

 $$q_1 = \frac{8.00 \times 10^{-6} \pm 6.88 \times 10^{-6}}{2}$$
</div>

This gives two solutions:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{8.00 + 6.88}{2} \times 10^{-6} = 7.44 \text{ μC}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_2 = 8.00 - 7.44 = 0.56 \text{ μC}$$
</div>

Or equivalently: $$q_1 = 0.56 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = 7.44 \text{ μC}$$.

**(b)** For an attractive force, the charges have opposite signs. Let $$q_1 = x$$ (positive) and $$q_2 = -(8.00 \times 10^{-6} - x)$$ (negative). The magnitude of their product is still $$4.17 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C}^2$$, so we get the same quadratic equation and the same magnitudes:

$$q_1 = +7.44 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = -0.56 \text{ μC}$$

or

$$q_1 = +0.56 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = -7.44 \text{ μC}$$

**Discussion**

Part (a): For a repulsive force, both charges must have the same sign. The charges are 7.44 μC and 0.56 μC (both positive, or both negative). The asymmetry makes sense—one charge is much larger than the other.

Part (b): For an attractive force, the charges must have opposite signs. The charges are +7.44 μC and −0.56 μC (or vice versa). Note that the magnitudes are the same as in part (a), but with opposite signs to create attraction rather than repulsion.

This problem illustrates an important principle: given only the force, distance, and total charge, we can determine the individual charges, but we need additional information (whether the force is attractive or repulsive) to determine the signs. The quadratic nature of the problem arises from the product $$q_1 q_2$$ in Coulomb's law.

Point charges of  $$5.00 µ\text{C} $$
 and  $$-3.00 µ\text{C} $$
 are placed 0.250 m apart. (a) Where can a third charge be placed so that the net force on it is zero? (b) What if both charges are positive?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For the net force on a third charge to be zero, the forces from the two existing charges must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This means the third charge must lie on the line connecting the two charges. We'll set up equations for each case and solve for the position.

**Solution**

**(a)** With charges $$q_1 = +5.00 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = -3.00 \text{ μC}$$ separated by $$d = 0.250 \text{ m}$$.

Since the charges have opposite signs, the third charge $$q_3$$ cannot be placed between them (both forces would point in the same direction). The equilibrium point must be beyond the negative charge.

Let $$x$$ be the distance from the negative charge ($$q_2$$) to the test charge, on the side away from $$q_1$$. Then the distance from $$q_1$$ to the test charge is $$d + x = 0.250 + x$$.

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_1 = F_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{\mid q_1 q_3 \mid}{(0.250 + x)^2} = k\frac{\mid q_2 q_3 \mid}{x^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{5.00}{(0.250 + x)^2} = \frac{3.00}{x^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 3.00(0.250 + x)^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 3.00(0.0625 + 0.500x + x^2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 0.1875 + 1.50x + 3.00x^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$2.00 x^2 - 1.50x - 0.1875 = 0$$
</div>

Using the quadratic formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{1.50 \pm \sqrt{(1.50)^2 + 4(2.00)(0.1875)}}{2(2.00)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{1.50 \pm \sqrt{2.25 + 1.50}}{4.00} = \frac{1.50 \pm \sqrt{3.75}}{4.00}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{1.50 \pm 1.936}{4.00}$$
</div>

Taking the positive solution:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{1.50 + 1.936}{4.00} = 0.859 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The third charge should be placed **0.859 m beyond the −3.00 μC charge** on the line connecting the two charges.

**(b)** With both charges positive: $$q_1 = +5.00 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = +3.00 \text{ μC}$$.

Now the equilibrium point must be between the charges. Let $$x$$ be the distance from the smaller charge ($$q_2 = 3.00 \text{ μC}$$). Then the distance from the larger charge is $$0.250 - x$$.

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{q_1}{(0.250 - x)^2} = \frac{q_2}{x^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{5.00}{(0.250 - x)^2} = \frac{3.00}{x^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 3.00(0.250 - x)^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 3.00(0.0625 - 0.500x + x^2)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$5.00 x^2 = 0.1875 - 1.50x + 3.00x^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$2.00 x^2 + 1.50x - 0.1875 = 0$$
</div>

Using the quadratic formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{-1.50 \pm \sqrt{(1.50)^2 + 4(2.00)(0.1875)}}{2(2.00)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{-1.50 \pm 1.936}{4.00}$$
</div>

Taking the positive solution:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{-1.50 + 1.936}{4.00} = 0.109 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The third charge should be placed **0.109 m from the +3.00 μC charge** (the lesser charge) on the line connecting the two charges.

**Discussion**

Part (a): When the two charges have opposite signs, the equilibrium point is outside the region between them, specifically 0.859 m beyond the negative charge. This makes sense because between opposite charges, both would pull a positive test charge toward themselves (or both would push a negative test charge away), so no equilibrium is possible there.

Part (b): When both charges are positive (like charges), the equilibrium point is between them, closer to the smaller charge (0.109 m from the 3.00 μC charge). This makes sense because the smaller charge exerts a weaker force, so the test charge must be closer to it to balance the stronger force from the larger charge.

These problems demonstrate the principle of superposition—the net force is the vector sum of individual forces—and show how equilibrium positions depend on both the magnitudes and signs of the charges involved.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This is similar to Problem 15. We have two equations: $$q_1 + q_2 = 20 \text{ μC}$$ (or $$q_1 - q_2 = 20 \text{ μC}$$ for opposite signs) and $$F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$. From these, we can find the product $$q_1 q_2$$, then solve the resulting quadratic equation.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$r = 3.00 \text{ m}$$
- Total charge magnitude = $$20 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$

**(a)** Repulsive force $$F = 0.075 \text{ N}$$ (both charges same sign)

From Coulomb's law:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 q_2 = \frac{Fr^2}{k} = \frac{(0.075)(3.00)^2}{8.99 \times 10^9}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 q_2 = \frac{0.675}{8.99 \times 10^9} = 7.51 \times 10^{-11} \text{ C}^2$$
</div>

With $$q_1 + q_2 = 20 \times 10^{-6}$$ and $$q_1 q_2 = 7.51 \times 10^{-11}$$:

Let $$q_2 = 20 \times 10^{-6} - q_1$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1(20 \times 10^{-6} - q_1) = 7.51 \times 10^{-11}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1^2 - 20 \times 10^{-6} q_1 + 7.51 \times 10^{-11} = 0$$
</div>

Using the quadratic formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{(20 \times 10^{-6})^2 - 4(7.51 \times 10^{-11})}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{4.00 \times 10^{-10} - 3.00 \times 10^{-10}}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{1.00 \times 10^{-10}}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm 10 \times 10^{-6}}{2}$$
</div>

This gives:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = 15 \text{ μC}, \quad q_2 = 5 \text{ μC}$$
</div>

or vice versa.

**(b)** Attractive force $$F = 0.525 \text{ N}$$ (opposite sign charges)

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 q_2 = \frac{(0.525)(3.00)^2}{8.99 \times 10^9} = \frac{4.725}{8.99 \times 10^9} = 5.26 \times 10^{-10} \text{ C}^2$$
</div>

For opposite signs, if $$q_1$$ is positive and $$q_2$$ is negative, the total charge is $$q_1 - \mid q_2 \mid = 20 \times 10^{-6}$$.

Let $$q_1 = x$$ and $$\mid q_2 \mid = x - 20 \times 10^{-6}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$x(x - 20 \times 10^{-6}) = 5.26 \times 10^{-10}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x^2 - 20 \times 10^{-6} x - 5.26 \times 10^{-10} = 0$$
</div>

Using the quadratic formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{(20 \times 10^{-6})^2 + 4(5.26 \times 10^{-10})}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{4.00 \times 10^{-10} + 2.10 \times 10^{-9}}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm \sqrt{2.50 \times 10^{-9}}}{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6} \pm 50 \times 10^{-6}}{2}$$
</div>

Taking the positive solution:

<div class="equation">
 $$x = \frac{70 \times 10^{-6}}{2} = 35 \text{ μC}$$
</div>

Therefore: $$q_1 = +35 \text{ μC}$$ and $$q_2 = -15 \text{ μC}$$ (or vice versa).

The magnitudes are **35 μC** and **15 μC**.

**Discussion**

Part (a): For a repulsive force of 0.075 N, the charges are 15 μC and 5 μC (both positive or both negative). These add to 20 μC total charge and produce the specified force at 3.00 m separation.

Part (b): For an attractive force of 0.525 N (7 times stronger), the charges must be opposite in sign with magnitudes 35 μC and 15 μC. The net charge is still 20 μC (the algebraic sum: +35 − 15 = +20 μC).

Notice that the attractive force case requires much larger individual charges than the repulsive case, even though the net charge is the same. This is because opposite signs allow charges to partially cancel in their sum while multiplying constructively in Coulomb's law. This problem beautifully illustrates how the force depends on the product of charges while the constraint involves their sum (or difference), leading to quadratic equations with physically meaningful solutions.
