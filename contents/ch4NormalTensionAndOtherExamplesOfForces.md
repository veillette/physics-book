Forces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, lift, weight, friction,
and tension. Traditionally, forces have been grouped into several categories and
given names relating to their source, how they are transmitted, or their
effects. The most important of these categories are discussed in this section,
together with some interesting applications. Further examples of forces are
discussed later in this text.

### Normal Force

**Weight** (also called force of gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all
times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling. You definitely
notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it
when you hold it stationary, as illustrated in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(a). But how do
inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on them, such
as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(b)? When the bag of dog food is placed on the
table, the table actually sags slightly under the load. This would be noticeable
if the load were placed on a card table, but even rigid objects deform when a
force is applied to them. Unless the object is deformed beyond its limit, it
will exert a restoring force much like a deformed spring (or trampoline or
diving board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force. So
when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring force
becomes as large as the weight of the load. At this point the net external force
on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load is stationary on the
table. The table sags quickly, and the sag is slight so we do not notice it. But
it is similar to the sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it.

![A person is holding a bag of dog food at some height from a table. He is exerting a force F sub hand, shown by a vector arrow in upward direction, and the weight W of the bag is acting downward, shown by a vector arrow having the same length as vector F sub hand. In a free-body diagram two forces are acting on the red point; one is F sub hand, shown by a vector arrow upward, and another is the weight W, shown by a vector arrow having the same length as vector F sub hand but pointing downward. (b) The bag of dog food is on the table, which deforms due to the weight W, shown by a vector arrow downward; the normal force N is shown by a vector arrow pointing upward having the same length as W. In the free-body diagram, vector W is shown by an arrow downward and vector N is shown by an arrow having the same length as vector W but pointing upward.](../resources/Figure_04_05_01.jpg '
(a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force ( \\vb{F}_{\\text{hand}} ) equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the food ( \\vb{w} ) .
(b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply a force ( \\vb{N} ) equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the load.')
{: #Figure1}

We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not, must
supply an upward force equal to the weight of the load, as we assumed in a few
of the previous examples. If the force supporting a load is perpendicular to the
surface of contact between the load and its support, this force is defined to be
a **normal force** and here is given the symbol $$ \vb{N} $$. (This is not the
unit for force N.)
The word _normal_ means perpendicular to a surface. The normal force can be less
than the object’s weight if the object is on an incline, as you will see in the
next example.

Common Misconception: Normal Force (N) vs. Newton (N)
</div>
In this section we have introduced the quantity normal force, which is represented by the variable $$ \vb{N} $$. This should not be confused with the symbol for the newton, which is also
represented by the letter N. These symbols are particularly important to
distinguish because the units of a normal force ( $$ \vb{N} $$)
happen to be newtons (N). For example, the normal force $$ \vb{N}
$$
that the floor exerts on a chair might be $$ \vb{N}=100 \N $$. One important difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is
simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations! You
will encounter more similarities among variables and units as you proceed in
physics. Another example of this is the quantity work ( $$ W $$)
and the unit watts (W).

Weight on an Incline, a Two-Dimensional Problem
</div>
Consider the skier on a slope shown in [Figure 2](#Figure2). Her mass including equipment is 60.0 kg.
(a) What is her acceleration if friction is negligible?
(b) What is her acceleration if friction is known to be 45.0 N?

![A skier is skiing down the slope and the slope makes a twenty-five degree angle with the horizontal. Her weight W, shown by a vector vertically downward, breaks into two components—one is W parallel, which is shown by a vector arrow parallel to the slope, and the other is W perpendicular, shown by a vector arrow perpendicular to the slope in the downward direction. Vector N is represented by an arrow pointing upward and perpendicular to the slope, having the same length as W perpendicular. Friction vector f is represented by an arrow along the slope in the uphill direction. IIn a free-body diagram, the vector arrow W for weight is acting downward, the vector arrow for f is shown along the direction of the slope, and the vector arrow for N is shown perpendicular to the slope.](../resources/Figure_04_05_02.jpg 'Since motion and friction are parallel to the slope, it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). ( \\vb{N} ) is perpendicular to the slope and ( \\vb{f} ) is parallel to the slope, but ( \\vb{w} ) has components along both axes, namely ( \\vb{w}_\\perp ) and ( \\vb{w}_\\parallel ) . ( \\vb{N} ) is equal in magnitude to ( \\vb{w}_\\parallel ) so that there is no motion perpendicular to the slope, but ( \\vb{f} ) is less than ( \\vb{w}_\\parallel ), so that there is a downslope acceleration (along the parallel axis).')
{: #Figure2}

**Strategy**

This is a two-dimensional problem, since the forces on the skier (the system of
interest) are not parallel. The approach we have used in two-dimensional
kinematics also works very well here. Choose a convenient coordinate system and
project the vectors onto its axes, creating _two_ connected _one_-dimensional
problems to solve. The most convenient coordinate system for motion on an
incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one
perpendicular to the slope. (Remember that motions along mutually perpendicular
axes are independent.) We use the symbols $$ \perp $$ and $$ \parallel $$ to
represent perpendicular and parallel, respectively. This choice of axes
simplifies this type of problem, because there is no motion perpendicular to the
slope and because friction is always parallel to the surface between two
objects. The only external forces acting on the system are the skier’s weight,
friction, and the support of the slope, respectively labeled $$\vb{w} $$, $$
\vb{f} $$, and $$ \vb{N} $$ in [Figure 2](#Figure2). $$ \vb{N} $$ is always
perpendicular to the slope, and $$ \vb{f} $$ is parallel to it. But $$ \vb{w} $$
is not in the direction of either axis, and so the first step we take is to
project it into components along the chosen axes, defining $$ w_{\parallel } $$
to be the component of weight parallel to the slope and $$ w_{\perp } $$ the
component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can
consider the two separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces
perpendicular to the slope.

**Solution**

The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is $$ w_
{\parallel}=w \sin{\left(25^\circ\right)}=mg\sin{\left(25^\circ\right)} $$, and
the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is $$ w_
{\perp}=w \cos{\left(25^\circ\right)}=mg\cos{\left(25^\circ\right)} $$.

(a) Neglecting friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we
need only consider forces parallel to the slope. (Forces perpendicular to the
slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction.) The forces
parallel to the slope are the amount of the skier’s weight parallel to the slope
$$ w\_{\parallel } $$ and friction $$ f $$. Using Newton’s second law, with
subscripts to denote quantities parallel to the slope,

<div class="equation">
 $$ a_{\parallel }=\frac{ F_{\text{net}\parallel }}{m} $$
</div>
where $$ F_{\text{net}\parallel }=w_{\parallel }=mg \sin\left(25^\circ\right) $$, assuming no friction for this part, so that

<div class="equation">
 $$ a_{\parallel }=\frac{ F_{\text{net}\parallel }}{m}=\frac{mg \sin\left(25^\circ\right)}{m}=g\sin\left(25^\circ\right) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
 $$ \left(9.80\mss \right)\left(0.4226\right)=4.14\mss $$
</div>
is the acceleration.

(b) Including friction. We now have a given value for friction, and we know its
direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion between surfaces in
contact. So the net external force is now

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}\parallel }=w_{\parallel }-f, $$
</div>
and substituting this into Newton’s second law, $$ a_{\parallel }=\frac{ F_{\text{net}\parallel }}{m} $$, gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ a_{\parallel }=\frac{ F_{\text{net}\mid \mid }}{m}=\frac{ w_{\parallel }-f}{m}=\frac{mg \sin\left(25^\circ\right)-f}{m}. $$
</div>
We substitute known values to obtain

<div class="equation">
 $$ a_{\parallel }=\frac{ \left(60.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(0.4226\right)-45.0 \N }{60.0 \kg }, $$
</div>
which yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ a_{\parallel }=3.39 \mss , $$
</div>
which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N of opposing friction.

**Discussion**

Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is
smaller when there is friction than when there is none. In fact, it is a general
result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then the acceleration down
the incline is $$ a=g\sin\theta $$, _regardless of mass_. This is related to the
previously discussed fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in
the absence of air resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide
down a frictionless incline with the same acceleration (if the angle is the
same).

Resolving Weight into Components
</div>
![Vector arrow W for weight is acting downward. It is resolved into components that are parallel and perpendicular to a surface that has a slope at angle theta to the horizontal. The coordinate direction x is labeled parallel to the sloped surface, with positive x pointing uphill. The coordinate direction y is labeled perpendicular to the sloped surface, with positive y pointing up from the surface. The components of w are w parallel, represented by an arrow pointing downhill along the sloped surface, and w perpendicular, represented by an arrow pointing into the sloped surface. W parallel is equal to w sine theta, which is equal to m g sine theta. W perpendicular is equal to w cosine theta, which is equal to m g cosine theta.](../resources/Figure_04_05_03.jpg "An object rests on an incline that makes an angle &#x3B8; with the horizontal."){: #Figure3}

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle $$ \theta $$ with the
horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two
components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane, $$ \vb{w}_
{\perp } $$, and a force acting parallel to the plane, $$ \vb{w}_
{\parallel } $$. The perpendicular force of weight, $$ \vb{w}_
{\perp } $$, is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the
normal force, $$ \vb{N} $$. The force acting parallel to the plane, $$ \vb{w}_
{\parallel } $$, causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of
friction, $$ \vb{f} $$, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward
along the plane.

It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into
components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle $$ \theta $$ to the
horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are

<div class="equation">
 $$ w_{\parallel }=w\sin\left(\theta \right)=mg \sin\left(\theta \right) $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation">
 $$ w_{\perp }=w\cos\left(\theta \right)=mg \cos\left(\theta \right). $$
</div>
Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to
determine them from reason. To do this,
draw the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle $$ \theta $$
of the incline is the same as the angle formed between $$ \vb{w} $$
 and $$ \vb{w}_{\perp } $$.
Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude
of the weight components:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\cos\left(\theta \right)&=& \frac{ w_{\perp }}{w}\\
w_{\perp }&=& w\cos\left(\theta \right)=mg \cos\left(\theta \right)
\end{array} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
\sin\left(\theta \right)&=& \frac{ w_{\parallel }}{w}\\
w_{\parallel }&=& w\sin\left(\theta \right)=mg \sin\left(\theta \right)
\end{array} $$

Take-Home Experiment: Force Parallel

To investigate how a force parallel to an inclined plane changes,
find a rubber band, some objects to hang
from the end of the rubber band, and a board you can position at different angles.
How much does the rubber band stretch when you hang the object from the end of the board?
Now place the board at an angle so that the object slides off when placed on the board.
How much does the rubber band extend if it is lined up parallel to the

### Tension

A **tension** is a force along the length of a medium, especially a force
carried by a flexible medium, such as a rope or cable. The word “tension” comes
from a Latin word meaning “to stretch.” Not coincidentally, the flexible cords
that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called _tendons_. Any
flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can exert
pulls only parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a flexible connector
is a tension with direction parallel to the connector. It is important to
understand that tension is a pull in a connector. In contrast, consider the
phrase: “You can’t push a rope.” The tension force pulls outward along the two
ends of a rope.

Consider a person holding a mass on a rope as shown in [Figure 4](#Figure4).

![An object of mass m is attached to a rope and a person is holding the rope. A weight vector W points downward starting from the lower point of the mass. A tension vector T is shown by an arrow pointing upward initiating from the hook where the mass and rope are joined, and a third vector, also T, is shown by an arrow pointing downward initiating from the hand of the person.](../resources/Figure_04_05_04.jpg 'When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as this rope transmits a force ( T ) , that force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton’s third law. The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in one location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the rope.')
{: #Figure4}

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove
using Newton’s second law. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary, then
its acceleration is zero, and thus $$ \vb{F}\_{\text{net}}=0 $$. The only
external forces acting on the mass are its weight $$ \vb{w} $$ and the tension
$$ \vb{T} $$ supplied by the rope. Thus,

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=T-w=0, $$
</div>

where $$ T $$ and $$ w $$ are the magnitudes of the tension and weight and their
signs indicate direction, with up being positive here. Thus, just as you would
expect, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass:

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=w=mg . $$
</div>

For a 5.00-kg mass, then (neglecting the mass of the rope) we see that

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=mg =\left(5.00 \kg \right)
\left(9.80 \mss \right)=49.0 \N . $$
</div>

If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length
corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing a direct observation and measure
of the tension force in the rope.

Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners, such as in
a hospital traction system, a finger joint, or a bicycle brake cable. If there
is no friction, the tension is transmitted undiminished. Only its direction
changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible connector. This is
illustrated in [Figure 5](#Figure5) (a) and (b).

![The internal structure of a finger with tendon, extensor muscle, and flexor muscle is shown. The force in the muscles is shown by arrows pointing along the tendon. In the second figure, part of a bicycle with a brake cable is shown. Three tension vectors are shown by the arrows along the brake cable, starting from the handle to the wheels. The tensions have the same magnitude but different directions.](../resources/Figure_04_05_05.jpg '(a) Tendons in the finger carry force ( T ) from the muscles to other parts of the finger, usually changing the force’s direction, but not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b) The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension ( T ) from the handlebars to the brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the magnitude of ( T ) is changed. ')

What Is the Tension in a Tightrope?
</div>
Calculate the tension in the wire supporting the 70.0-kg tightrope walker shown in [Figure 6](#Figure6).

![A tightrope walker is walking on a wire. His weight W is acting downward, shown by a vector arrow. The wire sags and makes a five-degree angle with the horizontal at both ends. T sub R, shown by a vector arrow, is toward the right along the wire. T sub L is shown by an arrow toward the left along the wire. All three vectors W, T sub L, and T sub R start from the foot of the person on the wire. In a free-body diagram, W is acting downward, T sub R is acting toward the right with a small inclination, and T sub L is acting toward the left with a small inclination.](../resources/Figure_04_05_06.jpg 'The weight of a tightrope walker causes a wire to sag by 5.0 degrees. The system of interest here is the point in the wire at which the tightrope walker is standing.')
{: #Figure6}

**Strategy**

As you can see in the figure, the wire is not perfectly horizontal (it cannot
be!), but is bent under the person’s weight. Thus, the tension on either side of
the person has an upward component that can support his weight. As usual, forces
are vectors represented pictorially by arrows having the same directions as the
forces and lengths proportional to their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope
walker, and the only external forces acting on him are his weight $$ \vb{w} $$
and the two tensions $$ \vb{T}_{\text{L}} $$
(left tension) and $$ \vb{T}_{\text{R}} $$
(right tension), as illustrated. It is reasonable to neglect the weight of the
wire itself. The net external force is zero since the system is stationary. A
little trigonometry can now be used to find the tensions. One conclusion is
possible at the outset—we can see from part (b) of the figure that the
magnitudes of the tensions $$ T_{\text{L}} $$ and $$ T_{\text{R}} $$ must be
equal. This is because there is no horizontal acceleration in the rope, and the
only forces acting to the left and right are $$ T_{\text{L}} $$ and $$ T_{R} $$.
Thus, the magnitude of those forces must be equal so that they cancel each other
out.

Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors are
parallel, the easiest method of solution is to pick a convenient coordinate
system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case the best coordinate
system has one axis horizontal and the other vertical. We call the horizontal
the $$ x $$ -axis and the vertical the $$ y $$ -axis.

**Solution**

First, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and vertical
components. It helps to draw a new free-body diagram showing all of the
horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on the system.

![A vector T sub L making an angle of five degrees with the negative x axis is shown. It has two components, one in the vertical direction, T sub L y, and another horizontal, T sub L x. Another vector is shown making an angle of five degrees with the positive x axis, having two components, one along the y direction, T sub R y, and the other along the x direction, T sub R x. In the free-body diagram, vertical component T sub L y is shown by a vector arrow in the upward direction, T sub R y is shown by a vector arrow in the upward direction, and weight W is shown by a vector arrow in the downward direction. The net force F sub y is equal to zero. In the horizontal direction, T sub R x is shown by a vector arrow pointing toward the right and T sub L x is shown by a vector arrow pointing toward the left, both having the same length so that the net force in the horizontal direction, F sub x, is equal to zero.](../resources/Figure_04_05_07.jpg 'When the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes, their components along those axes must add to zero, since the tightrope walker is stationary. The small angle results in ( T ) being much greater than ( w ) .')
{: #Figure7}

Consider the horizontal components of the forces
(denoted with a subscript $$ x $$):

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}x}=T_{\text{L}x}-T_{\text{R}x}. $$
</div>
The net external horizontal force $$ F_{\text{net}x}=0 $$,
since the person is stationary. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}x}=0&=& T_{\text{L}x}-T_{\text{R}x}\\
T_{\text{L}x}&=& T_{\text{R}x}.
\end{array} $$
</div>
Now, observe [Figure 7](#Figure7). You can use trigonometry
to determine the magnitude of $$ T_{\text{L}} $$
and $$ T_{\text{R}} $$. Notice that:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& \frac{ T_{\text{L}x}}{ T_{\text{L}}}\\
T_{\text{L}x}&=& T_{\text{L}}\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right)\\
\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& \frac{ T_{\text{R}x}}{ T_{\text{R}}}\\
T_{\text{R}x}&=& T_{\text{R}}\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right).
\end{array} $$
</div>
Equating $$ T_{\text{L}x} $$ and $$ T_{\text{R}x} $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ T_{\text{L}}\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right)=T_{\text{R}}\cos\left(5.0^\circ \right). $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ T_{\text{L}}=T_{\text{R}}=T, $$
</div>
as predicted. Now, considering the vertical components
(denoted by a subscript $$ y $$ ), we can solve for $$ T $$. Again, since the person is stationary, Newton’s
second law implies that net $$ F_{y}=0 $$. Thus, as illustrated in the free-body
diagram in [Figure 7](#Figure7),

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}y}=T_{\text{L}y}+T_{\text{R}y}-w=0. $$
</div>
Observing [Figure 7](#Figure7), we can use trigonometry
to determine the relationship between $$ T_{\text{L}y} $$,
$$ T_{\text{R}y} $$, and $$ T $$. As we determined from the analysis in the
horizontal direction, $$ T_{\text{L}}=T_{\text{R}}=T $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& \frac{ T_{\text{L}y}}{ T_{\text{L}}}\\
T_{\text{L}y}=T_{\text{L}}\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)\\
\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& \frac{ T_{\text{R}y}}{ T_{\text{R}}}\\
T_{\text{R}y}=T_{\text{R}}\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right).
\end{array} $$
</div>
Now, we can substitute the values for $$ T_{\text{L}y} $$
and $$ T_{\text{R}y} $$, into the net force equation in the vertical
direction:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
{F}_{\text{net}y}&=& T_{\text{L}y}+T_{\text{R}y}-w=0\\
{F}_{\text{net}y}&=& T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)+T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)-w=0\\ 2T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)-w&=& 0\\ 2T\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)&=& w\end{array} $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=\frac{w}{2\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)}=\frac{mg }{2\sin\left(5.0^\circ \right)}, $$
</div>
so that

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=\frac{ \left(70.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)}{2\left(0.0872\right)}, $$
</div>
and the tension is
<div class="equation">
 $$ T=3900 \N . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Note that the vertical tension in the wire acts as a normal force that supports
the weight of the tightrope walker. The tension is almost six times the 686-N
weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly horizontal, the
vertical component of its tension is only a small fraction of the tension in the
wire. The large horizontal components are in opposite directions and cancel, and
so most of the tension in the wire is not used to support the weight of the
tightrope walker.

</div>

If we wish to _create_ a very large tension, all we have to do is exert a force
perpendicular to a flexible connector, as illustrated in [Figure 8](#Figure8). As
we saw in the last example, the weight of the tightrope walker acted as a force
perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the roped related to the
weight of the tightrope walker in the following way:

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=\frac{w}{2\sin\left(\theta \right)}. $$
</div>

We can extend this expression to describe the tension $$ T $$ created when a
perpendicular force ( $$ \vb{F}\_{\perp } $$)
is exerted at the middle of a flexible connector:

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=\frac{ F_{\perp }}{2\sin\left(\theta \right)}. $$
</div>

Note that $$ \theta $$ is the angle between the horizontal and the bent
connector. In this case, $$ T $$ becomes very large as $$ \theta $$ approaches
zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible connector will cause it
to sag, since an infinite tension would result if it were horizontal (
i.e., $$ \theta =0 $$ and $$ \sin{\theta} =0 $$).
(See [Figure 8](#Figure8).)

![A car stuck in mud is being pulled out by a chain tied to a tree trunk. A force perpendicular to the length of the chain is applied, represented by an arrow. The tension T along the chain makes an angle with the horizontal line.](../resources/Figure_04_05_08.jpg "We can create a very large tension in the chain by pushing on it perpendicular to its length, as shown. Suppose we wish to pull a car out of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as nearly straight as possible. The tension in the chain is given by \( T= \frac{F*{\perp}}{2 \sin{ \theta }} \), since \( \theta \) is small, \( T \) is very large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope walker shown in <a href="#Figure6">Figure 6</a>, except that the tensions shown here are those transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those acting at the point where \( F\_\perp \) is applied.")

The weight of the bridge is evenly distributed along the length of flexible connectors, usually cables, which take on the characteristic shape. (credit: Leaflet, Wikimedia Commons)')

### Extended Topic: Real Forces and Inertial Frames

There is another distinction among forces in addition to the types already
mentioned. Some forces are real, whereas others are not. _Real forces_ are those
that have some physical origin, such as the gravitational pull.
Contrastingly, **fictitious forces** are those that arise simply because an
observer is in an accelerating frame of reference, such as one that rotates (
like a merry-go-round) or undergoes linear acceleration (like a car slowing
down). For example, if a satellite is heading due north above Earth’s northern
hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth it will appear to experience a force to
the west that has no physical origin. Of course, what is happening here is that
Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In Earth’s
frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite, or it can be
interpreted as a violation of Newton’s first law (the law of inertia). An
**inertial frame of reference** is one in which all forces are real and,
equivalently, one in which Newton’s laws have the simple forms given in this
chapter.

Earth’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame. You
ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the
slight departures from Newton’s laws, such as the effect just described. On the
large scale, such as for the rotation of weather systems and ocean currents, the
effects can be easily observed.

The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is inertial is
whether it accelerates or rotates relative to a known inertial frame. Unless
stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this text are considered in
inertial frames.

All the forces discussed in this section are real forces, but there are a number
of other real forces, such as lift and thrust, that are not discussed in this
section. They are more specialized, and it is not necessary to discuss every
type of force. It is natural, however, to ask where the basic simplicity we seek
to find in physics is in the long list of forces. Are some more basic than
others? Are some different manifestations of the same underlying force? The
answer to both questions is yes, as will be seen in the next few sections.

### Section Summary

- When objects rest on a surface, the surface applies a force to the object that
  supports the weight of the object. This supporting force acts perpendicular to
  and away from the surface. It is called a normal force, $$ \vb{N} $$.
- When objects rest on a non-accelerating horizontal surface, the magnitude of
  the normal force is equal to the weight of the object:
  <div class="equation">
  $$ N=mg . $$
  </div>

- When objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle $$ \theta $$ with
  the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be resolved into
  components that act perpendicular ( $$ \vb{w}_{\perp } $$)
  and parallel ( $$ \vb{w}_{\parallel } $$)
  to the surface of the plane. These components can be calculated using:
   <div class="equation">
     $$ w_{\parallel }=w\sin\left(\theta \right)=mg \sin\left(\theta \right) $$
   </div>

   <div class="equation">
  $$ w_{\perp }=w\cos\left(\theta \right)=mg \cos\left(\theta \right). $$
   </div>

- The pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a
  rope or cable, is called tension, $$ \vb{T} $$. When a rope supports the
  weight of an object that is at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the
  weight of the object:
  <div class="equation">
    $$ T=mg . $$
  </div>

- In any inertial frame of reference (one that is not accelerated or rotated),
  Newton’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter and all forces are
  real forces having a physical origin.

### Problem Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war. Each of the first team's members has an average mass of 68 kg and exerts an average force of 1350 N horizontally. Each of the second team's members has an average mass of 73 kg and exerts an average force of 1365 N horizontally.
(a) What is magnitude of the acceleration of the two teams?
(b) What is the tension in the section of rope between the teams?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Treat both teams as one system to find acceleration. The net force is the difference between the two teams' total forces, and the total mass is the sum of all members' masses. For tension, consider one team as the system.

**Solution**

**(a) Acceleration of the system:**

1. Calculate total force from each team:
   - Team 1: $$ F_1 = 9 \times 1350 \N = 12150 \N $$
   - Team 2: $$ F_2 = 9 \times 1365 \N = 12285 \N $$

2. Calculate net force (Team 2 pulls harder):
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{net} = F_2 - F_1 = 12285 \N - 12150 \N = 135 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate total mass:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{total} = 9 \times 68 \kg + 9 \times 73 \kg = 612 \kg + 657 \kg = 1269 \kg $$
</div>

4. Apply Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{net}}{m_{total}} = \frac{135 \N}{1269 \kg} = 0.106 \mss \approx 0.11 \mss $$
</div>

**(b) Tension in the rope:**

Consider Team 1 as the system. The rope tension T pulls Team 1 toward Team 2, and Team 1's force $$ F_1 $$ opposes this motion:

<div class="equation">
$$ T - F_1 = m_1 \cdot a $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = F_1 + m_1 \cdot a = 12150 \N + (612 \kg)(0.106 \mss) = 12150 \N + 65 \N = 12215 \N \approx 1.2 \times 10^4 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tension in the rope (about 12,200 N) is much larger than the net force (135 N). This is because the rope must transmit the combined pulling forces of both teams; the net force only determines the acceleration.

(a) The acceleration of both teams is $$ 0.11 \mss $$ in the direction of Team 2's pull.

(b) The tension in the rope between the teams is $$ 1.2 \times 10^4 \N $$.

What force does a trampoline have to apply to a 45.0-kg gymnast to accelerate her straight up at $$ 7.50 \mss  $$?
Note that the answer is independent of the velocity of the gymnast—she can be
moving either up or down, or be stationary.
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Apply Newton's second law in the vertical direction. The trampoline exerts an upward normal force, while gravity exerts a downward force (weight). The net force must produce the upward acceleration.

**Solution**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Mass: $$ m = 45.0 \kg $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = 7.50 \mss $$ (upward)
   - Gravitational acceleration: $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$

2. Draw a free-body diagram (forces on gymnast):
   - Upward: Normal force from trampoline, $$ N $$
   - Downward: Weight, $$ w = mg $$

3. Apply Newton's second law (taking upward as positive):
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{net} = N - w = ma $$
</div>

4. Solve for the normal force $$ N $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ N = ma + w = ma + mg = m(a + g) $$
</div>

5. Substitute values:
<div class="equation">
$$ N = (45.0 \kg)(7.50 \mss + 9.80 \mss) = (45.0 \kg)(17.30 \mss) = 779 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The trampoline must exert a force greater than the gymnast's weight (441 N) because it must both support her weight and provide the additional force needed for upward acceleration. The total force is about 1.8 times her weight.

The trampoline must apply a force of $$ 779 \N $$ upward on the gymnast.

(a) Calculate the tension in a vertical strand of spider web if a spider of
mass $$ 8.00 \times 10^{-5}\kg $$ hangs motionless on it.
(b) Calculate the tension in a horizontal strand of
spider web if the same spider sits motionless in the middle of it much like the
tightrope walker in [Figure 6](#Figure6). The strand sags at an
angle of $$ 12^\circ $$ below the horizontal. Compare this with the tension in
the vertical strand (find their ratio).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), the spider hangs motionless, so the tension equals the spider's weight. For part (b), analyze the forces in the horizontal strand: two tension forces at angles must have a vertical component that balances the spider's weight.

**Solution**

Given:

- Mass of spider: $$ m = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \kg $$
- Angle below horizontal: $$ \theta = 12^\circ $$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$

**(a) Tension in vertical strand:**

For a motionless spider hanging on a vertical strand, the tension must equal the weight:

<div class="equation">
$$ T_{\text{vertical}} = w = mg = (8.00 \times 10^{-5} \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 7.84 \times 10^{-4} \N $$
</div>

**(b) Tension in horizontal strand:**

When the spider sits in the middle of a horizontal strand, the strand sags symmetrically. Each half makes an angle $$ \theta = 12^\circ $$ below horizontal. The vertical components of tension from both sides must balance the spider's weight.

Free-body diagram analysis:

- Two tension forces $$ T $$ at angle $$ \theta $$ below horizontal
- Weight $$ w $$ downward

Vertical force balance:

<div class="equation">
$$ 2T\sin(\theta) = w $$
</div>

Solve for tension:

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{w}{2\sin(\theta)} = \frac{7.84 \times 10^{-4} \N}{2\sin(12^\circ)} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{7.84 \times 10^{-4} \N}{2(0.2079)} = \frac{7.84 \times 10^{-4} \N}{0.4158} = 1.89 \times 10^{-3} \N $$
</div>

**Compare to vertical tension:**

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{T_{\text{horizontal}}}{T_{\text{vertical}}} = \frac{1.89 \times 10^{-3} \N}{7.84 \times 10^{-4} \N} = 2.41 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tension in the horizontal strand is 2.41 times greater than in the vertical strand, even though the same spider hangs on both. This occurs because the horizontal strand must support the spider's weight using only the vertical components of tension. Since $$ \sin(12^\circ) $$ is only about 0.21, each side contributes only 21% of its tension to vertical support. This is why tightrope walkers need extremely strong cables—the more horizontal the rope, the greater the tension. If the angle approached zero (perfectly horizontal), the required tension would approach infinity.

**Answer**

(a) The tension in the vertical strand is **7.84 × 10⁻⁴ N**.

(b) The tension in the horizontal strand is **1.89 × 10⁻³ N**, which is **2.41 times** the tension in the vertical strand.

Suppose a 60.0-kg gymnast climbs a rope.
(a) What is the tension in the rope if he climbs at a constant speed?
(b) What is the tension in the rope if he accelerates upward at a rate of $$ 1.50 \mss  $$?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Apply Newton's second law to the gymnast. The rope tension pulls upward, and weight pulls downward. At constant speed, acceleration is zero; when accelerating upward, acceleration is positive.

**Solution**

Given: $$ m = 60.0 \kg $$, $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$

**(a) Climbing at constant speed (a = 0):**

Since acceleration is zero, the net force must be zero:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{net} = T - w = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = w = mg = (60.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 588 \N $$
</div>

**(b) Accelerating upward at 1.50 m/s²:**

Apply Newton's second law with upward as positive:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{net} = T - w = ma $$
</div>

Solve for tension:

<div class="equation">
$$ T = ma + w = ma + mg = m(a + g) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T = (60.0 \kg)(1.50 \mss + 9.80 \mss) = (60.0 \kg)(11.30 \mss) = 678 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

When climbing at constant speed, the tension equals the gymnast's weight. When accelerating upward, the tension must exceed the weight to provide the net upward force. The extra 90 N of tension (678 - 588 = 90 N) provides the force needed for the acceleration.

(a) At constant speed, the rope tension is $$ 588 \N $$.

(b) When accelerating upward at 1.50 m/s², the rope tension is $$ 678 \N $$.

Show that, as stated in the text, a force $$ \vb{F}_{\perp } $$
exerted on a flexible medium at its center and perpendicular to its length (such
as on the tightrope wire in [Figure 6](#Figure6)) gives rise to a
tension of magnitude $$ T=\frac{ F_{\perp }}{2\sin\left( \theta \right)} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Apply Newton's second law to the point where the perpendicular force is applied. Since the system is in equilibrium (no acceleration), the net force must be zero. Analyze the vertical forces: the applied force downward and the vertical components of tension from both sides upward.

**Solution**

Consider a flexible medium (rope, cable, wire) with a perpendicular force $$ \vb{F}\_{\perp} $$ (magnitude $$ F $$) applied at its center, causing it to sag at angle $$ \theta $$ from horizontal.

**Free-body diagram at the application point:**

- Applied force: $$ F $$ (downward, perpendicular to original horizontal)
- Tension to the left: $$ T $$ at angle $$ \theta $$ below horizontal
- Tension to the right: $$ T $$ at angle $$ \theta $$ below horizontal

**Horizontal force analysis:**

The horizontal components of tension cancel:

<div class="equation">
$$ T\cos(\theta) - T\cos(\theta) = 0 $$
</div>

**Vertical force analysis:**

For equilibrium in the vertical direction, applying Newton's second law with zero acceleration:

<div class="equation">
$$ \sum F_y = 2T\sin(\theta) - F = 0 $$
</div>

The factor of 2 appears because both sides contribute a vertical component $$ T\sin(\theta) $$.

Rearranging:

<div class="equation">
$$ F = 2T\sin(\theta) $$
</div>

Solving for tension:

<div class="equation">
$$ T = \frac{F}{2\sin(\theta)} = \frac{F_{\perp}}{2\sin(\theta)} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This formula reveals an important principle: as the angle $$ \theta $$ decreases (rope becomes more horizontal), the denominator $$ 2\sin(\theta) $$ becomes smaller, so the tension $$ T $$ must increase to support the same perpendicular force. This explains why:

- A perfectly horizontal wire would require infinite tension to support any load
- Tightrope walkers use long poles to increase their sag angle, reducing cable tension
- Power lines and suspension bridges are designed with appropriate sag

For small angles, $$ \sin(\theta) \approx \theta $$ (in radians), and tension increases roughly as $$ 1/\theta $$.

**Answer**

The derivation shows that a perpendicular force $$ F_{\perp} $$ applied at the center of a flexible medium produces a tension of magnitude $$ T = \frac{F_{\perp}}{2\sin(\theta)} $$, where $$ \theta $$ is the angle the medium makes with the horizontal.

Consider the baby being weighed in [Figure 12](#Figure12).
(a) What is the mass of the child and basket if a scale reading of 55 N is
observed?
(b) What is the tension $$ T_{1} $$ in the cord attaching the baby to the scale?
(c) What is the tension $$ T_{2} $$ in the cord attaching the scale to the ceiling, if the scale has a mass of 0.500 kg?
(d) Draw a sketch of the situation indicating the system of interest used to
solve each part. The masses of the cords are negligible.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The scale reading indicates the force it applies to what hangs below it (the baby and basket), which by Newton's third law equals the force they exert on the scale. Use this to find the mass. The tensions can be found by analyzing forces on each system: the baby+basket, and then the baby+basket+scale.

**Solution**

Given:

- Scale reading: $$ 55 \N $$
- Mass of scale: $$ m\_{\text{scale}} = 0.500 \kg $$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$

**(a) Mass of child and basket:**

The scale reading equals the weight of the child and basket:

<div class="equation">
$$ w_{\text{baby}} = 55 \N $$
</div>

From $$ w = mg $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{baby}} = \frac{w_{\text{baby}}}{g} = \frac{55 \N}{9.80 \mss} = 5.61 \kg $$
</div>

**(b) Tension $$ T_1 $$ in cord attaching baby to scale:**

Consider the baby and basket as the system. Forces acting on it:

- Weight: $$ w\_{\text{baby}} = 55 \N $$ (downward)
- Tension: $$ T_1 $$ (upward)

Since the baby is motionless (equilibrium):

<div class="equation">
$$ T_1 - w_{\text{baby}} = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T_1 = w_{\text{baby}} = 55 \N $$
</div>

**(c) Tension $$ T_2 $$ in cord attaching scale to ceiling:**

Consider the entire system (baby + basket + scale). Forces acting on this system:

- Combined weight: $$ w_{\text{baby}} + w_{\text{scale}} $$ (downward)
- Tension from ceiling: $$ T_2 $$ (upward)

Weight of scale:

<div class="equation">
$$ w_{\text{scale}} = m_{\text{scale}} g = (0.500 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 4.90 \N $$
</div>

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
$$ T_2 - w_{\text{baby}} - w_{\text{scale}} = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ T_2 = w_{\text{baby}} + w_{\text{scale}} = 55 \N + 4.90 \N = 59.9 \N \approx 60 \N $$
</div>

**(d) System sketches:**

**Part (a) and (b):** System = baby + basket

```
    T₁ ↑
    [Baby + Basket]
    W_baby ↓ (55 N)
```

**Part (c):** System = baby + basket + scale

```
    T₂ ↑
    [Scale (4.90 N)]
    [Baby + Basket (55 N)]
    (W_baby + W_scale) ↓ (59.9 N)
```

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates how forces propagate through a system. The bottom cord ($$ T_1 $$) supports only the baby and basket (55 N). The top cord ($$ T_2 $$) must support everything below it: the baby, basket, and scale (59.9 N). The scale reading (55 N) represents the force the scale exerts upward on the baby, which equals the force the baby exerts downward on the scale by Newton's third law. This is why scales measure weight even though they actually measure the force exerted on them.

**Answer**

(a) The mass of the child and basket is **5.61 kg**.

(b) The tension $$ T_1 $$ in the cord attaching the baby to the scale is **55 N**.

(c) The tension $$ T_2 $$ in the cord attaching the scale to the ceiling is **60 N** (or **59.9 N**).

(d) System sketches are shown above.
