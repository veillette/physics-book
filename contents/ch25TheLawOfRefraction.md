* Determine the index of refraction, given the speed of light in a medium.
</div>

It is easy to notice some odd things when looking into a fish tank. For example,
you may see the same fish appearing to be in two different places. (
See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) This is because light coming from the fish to us
changes direction when it leaves the tank, and in this case, it can travel two
different paths to get to our eyes. The changing of a light ray’s direction (
loosely called bending) when it passes through variations in matter is called **refraction**. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical
phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical
fibers.

Speed of Light

The speed of light  $$c $$
 not only affects refraction, it is one of the central concepts of Einstein’s theory of relativity. As the accuracy of the measurements of the speed of light were improved,  $$c $$
 was found not to depend on the velocity of the source or the observer. However, the speed of light does vary in a precise manner with the material it traverses. These facts have far-reaching implications, as we will see in [Special Relativity](./ch28SpecialRelativity). It makes connections between space and time and alters our expectations that all observers measure the same time for the same event, for example. The speed of light is so important that its value in a vacuum is one of the most fundamental constants in nature as well as being one of the four fundamental SI units.

![A person looks at a fish tank and he sees the same fish in two different directions at the edge of the water tank facing him.](../resources/Figure_25_03_01.jpg 'Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions when it passes from water to air. In this case, the light can reach the observer by two different paths, and so the fish seems to be in two different places. This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible for many optical phenomena.')

Why does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to
another? It is because light changes speed when going from one material to
another. So before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the
speed of light and how it varies in different media.

### The Speed of Light

Early attempts to measure the speed of light, such as those made by Galileo,
determined that light moved extremely fast, perhaps instantaneously. The first
real evidence that light traveled at a finite speed came from the Danish
astronomer Ole Roemer in the late 17th century. Roemer had noted that the
average orbital period of one of Jupiter’s moons, as measured from Earth, varied
depending on whether Earth was moving toward or away from Jupiter. He correctly
concluded that the apparent change in period was due to the change in distance
between Earth and Jupiter and the time it took light to travel this distance.
From his 1676 data, a value of the speed of light was calculated to be $$ 2.26
\times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$
(only 25% different from today’s accepted value). In more recent times,
physicists have measured the speed of light in numerous ways and with increasing
accuracy. One particularly direct method, used in 1887 by the American physicist
Albert Michelson (1852–1931), is illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Light
reflected from a rotating set of mirrors was reflected from a stationary mirror
35 km away and returned to the rotating mirrors. The time for the light to
travel can be determined by how fast the mirrors must rotate for the light to be
returned to the observer’s eye.

![In stage one of the figure, the light falling from a source on an eight-sided mirror is viewed by an observer; in stage two, the mirror is made to rotate and the reflected light falling onto a stationary mirror kept at a certain distance of 35 kilometers is viewed by an observer. In stage three, the observer can see the reflected ray only when the mirror has rotated into the correct position just as the ray returns.](../resources/Figure_25_03_02.jpg "A schematic of early apparatus used by Michelson and others to determine the speed of light. As the mirrors rotate, the reflected ray is only briefly directed at the stationary mirror. The returning ray will be reflected into the observer's eye only if the next mirror has rotated into the correct position just as the ray returns. By measuring the correct rotation rate, the time for the round trip can be measured and the speed of light calculated. Michelson’s calculated value of the speed of light was only 0.04% different from the value used today.")
{: #Figure2}

The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light
in a vacuum $$c $$ is so important that it is accepted as one of the basic
physical quantities and has the fixed value

<div class="equation" >
 $$c= 2.99792458 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\approx  3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s} \text{,}  $$
</div>

where the approximate value of $$ 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ is used
whenever three-digit accuracy is sufficient. The speed of light through matter
is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a
material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, since its
interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures
varies. We define the **index of refraction** $$n $$ of a material to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$n=\frac{c}{v}, $$
</div>

where $$v $$ is the observed speed of light in the material. Since the speed of
light is always less than $$c $$ in matter and equals $$c $$ only in a
vacuum, the index of refraction is always greater than or equal to one.

That is, $$n\ge 1 $$ .
[[Table 1]](#Table1) gives the indices of refraction for some representative
substances. The values are listed for a particular wavelength of light, because
they vary slightly with wavelength. (This can have important effects, such as
colors produced by a prism.) Note that for gases, $$n $$ is close to 1.0. This
seems reasonable, since atoms in gases are widely separated and light travels at
$$c $$ in the vacuum between atoms. It is common to take $$n=1 $$ for gases
unless great precision is needed. Although the speed of light $$v $$ in a medium
varies considerably from its value $$c $$ in a vacuum, it is still a large
speed.

Speed of Light in Matter
</div>
Calculate the speed of light in zircon, a material used in jewelry to imitate diamond.

**Strategy**

The speed of light in a material, $$v $$ , can be calculated from the index of
refraction $$n $$ of the material using the equation $$n=c/v $$.

**Solution**

The equation for index of refraction states that $$n=c/v $$ . Rearranging this
to determine $$v $$ gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{c}{n}. $$
</div>
The index of refraction for zircon is given as 1.923 in [[Table 1]](#Table1), and  $$c $$
 is given in the equation for speed of light. Entering these values in the last expression gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{ccc}v& =& \frac{ 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}{ 1.923}\\ & =&  1.56 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This speed is slightly larger than half the speed of light in a vacuum and is
still high compared with speeds we normally experience. The only substance
listed in [[Table 1]](#Table1) that has a greater index of refraction than
zircon is diamond. We shall see later that the large index of refraction for
zircon makes it sparkle more than glass, but less than diamond.

</div>

### Law of Refraction

[[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows how a ray of light changes direction when it passes
from one medium to another. As before, the angles are measured relative to a
perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. (Some
of the incident light will be reflected from the surface, but for now we will
concentrate on the light that is transmitted.) The change in direction of the
light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of
light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the
situations shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), medium 2 has a greater index of
refraction than medium 1. This means that the speed of light is less in medium 2
than in medium 1. Note that as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(a), the direction
of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when it slows down. Conversely, as
shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b), the direction of the ray moves away from the
perpendicular when it speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases,
you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a
footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the front
wheels are slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in
direction as for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going
from the grass to the footpath, the front wheels can move faster and the mower
changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as for
light going from slow to fast.

![The figures compare the working of a lawn mower to that of the refraction phenomenon. In figure (a) the lawn mower goes from a sidewalk to grass, it slows down and bends towards a perpendicular drawn at the point of contact of the mower with the surface of separation. An imaginary line along the mower when it is on sidewalk is taken to be the incident ray and the angle which the mower makes with the perpendicular is taken to be theta one. As it goes into the grass, the mower turns and the imaginary line moves towards the perpendicular line drawn and makes an angle theta two with it. The imaginary line drawn along the mower when the mower is in the grass is taken to be the refracted ray. Sidewalk is taken to be a medium of refractive index n one and that of grass to be taken as n two. In figure (b), the situation is the reverse of what has happened in figure (a). The mower moves from grass to sidewalk and the ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up.](../resources/Figure_25_03_03.jpg 'The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the speed of light changes when it crosses from one medium to another. The speed of light is greater in medium 1 than in medium 2 in the situations shown here. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the perpendicular when it slows down. This is analogous to what happens when a lawn mower goes from a footpath to grass. (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up. This is analogous to what happens when a lawn mower goes from grass to footpath. The paths are exactly reversible.')
{: #Figure3}

The amount that a light ray changes its direction depends both on the incident
angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident
angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a
large change in angle. The exact mathematical relationship is the **law of
refraction**, or “Snell’s Law,” which is stated in equation form as

<div class="equation" >
 $${n}_{1} \sin {\theta }_{1}={n}_{2} \sin {\theta }_{2}. $$
</div>

Here $${n}_{1} $$ and $${n}_{2} $$ are the indices of refraction for medium 1
and 2, and $${\theta }_{1} $$ and $${\theta }_{2} $$ are the angles between the
rays and the perpendicular in medium 1 and 2, as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)
. The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the outgoing ray the refracted
ray, and the associated angles the incident angle and the refracted angle. The
law of refraction is also called Snell’s law after the Dutch mathematician
Willebrord Snell (1591–1626), who discovered it in 1621. Snell’s experiments
showed that the law of refraction was obeyed and that a characteristic index of
refraction $$n $$ could be assigned to a given medium. Snell was not aware that
the speed of light varied in different media, but through experiments he was
able to determine indices of refraction from the way light rays changed
direction.

Determine the Index of Refraction from Refraction Data
</div>
Find the index of refraction for medium 2 in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(a), assuming medium 1 is air and given the incident angle is  $$ 30.0º $$
 and the angle of refraction is  $$ 22.0º $$.

**Strategy**

The index of refraction for air is taken to be 1 in most cases (and up to four
significant figures, it is 1.000). Thus $${n}_{1}= 1.00 $$ here. From the given
information, $${\theta }_{1}= 30.0º $$ and $${\theta }_{2}= 22.0º $$ . With this
information, the only unknown in Snell’s law is $${n}_{2} $$ , so that it can be
used to find this unknown.

**Solution**

Snell’s law is

<div class="equation" >
 $${n}_{1} \sin {\theta }_{1}={n}_{2} \sin {\theta }_{2}. $$
</div>
Rearranging to isolate  $${n}_{2} $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $${n}_{2}={n}_{1}\frac{\sin {\theta }_{1}}{\sin {\theta }_{2}}. $$

Entering known values,

<div class="equation">
 $$\begin{array}{ll}{n}_{2}& =&  1.00\frac{\sin  30.0º}{\sin  22.0º}=\frac{ 0.500}{ 0.375}\\ & =& 1.33.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is the index of refraction for water, and Snell could have determined it by
measuring the angles and performing this calculation. He would then have found
1.33 to be the appropriate index of refraction for water in all other
situations, such as when a ray passes from water to glass. Today we can verify
that the index of refraction is related to the speed of light in a medium by
measuring that speed directly.

A Larger Change in Direction
</div>
Suppose that in a situation like that in [[Example 2]](#Example2), light goes from air to diamond and that the incident angle is  $$ 30.0º $$ .
 Calculate the angle of refraction  $${\theta }_{2} $$
 in the diamond.

**Strategy**

Again the index of refraction for air is taken to be $${n}_{1}= 1.00 $$ , and we
are given $${\theta }_{1}= 30.0º $$ . We can look up the index of refraction for
diamond in [[Table 1]](#Table1), finding $${n}_{2}= 2.419 $$ . The only unknown
in Snell’s law is $${\theta }_{2} $$ , which we wish to determine.

**Solution**

Solving Snell’s law for $$\sin {\theta }_{2} $$ yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{2}=\frac{ {n}_{1}}{ {n}_{2}}\sin {\theta }_{1}. $$
</div>
Entering known values,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sin {\theta }_{2}=\frac{ 1.00}{ 2.419}\sin  30.0º=\left( 0.413\right)\left( 0.500\right)= 0.207. $$
</div>
The angle is thus

<div class="equation" >
 $${\theta }_{2}={\sin}^{-1} 0.207= 11.9º. $$

For the same $$30º $$ angle of incidence, the angle of refraction in diamond is
significantly smaller than in water ( $$11.9º $$ rather than $$22º $$ —see the
preceding example). This means there is a larger change in direction in diamond.
The cause of a large change in direction is a large change in the index of
refraction (or speed). In general, the larger the change in speed, the greater
the effect on the direction of the ray.

</div>

### Section Summary

- The changing of a light ray’s direction when it passes through variations in
  matter is called refraction.
- The speed of light in vacuum $$c= 2.99792458 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s}\approx
  3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s}. $$
- Index of refraction $$n=\frac{c}{v} $$ , where $$v $$ is the speed of light in
  the material, $$c $$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $$n $$ is the index
  of refraction.
- Snell’s law, the law of refraction, is stated in equation form as $${n}_{1}
  \sin {\theta }_{1}={n}_{2} \sin {\theta }_{2} $$ .

What is the speed of light in water? In glycerine?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship $$v = c/n$$ to calculate the speed of light in each medium. From [[Table 1]](#Table1), the index of refraction for water is $$n_{\text{water}} = 1.333$$ and for glycerine is $$n_{\text{glycerine}} = 1.473$$.

**Solution**

For water:
<div class="equation">
$$v_{\text{water}} = \frac{c}{n_{\text{water}}} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.333} = 2.25 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

For glycerine:
<div class="equation">
$$v_{\text{glycerine}} = \frac{c}{n_{\text{glycerine}}} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.473} = 2.04 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Answer:** The speed of light in water is **2.25 × 10⁸ m/s** and in glycerine is **2.04 × 10⁸ m/s**.

**Discussion**

Light travels at about 75% of its vacuum speed in water and about 68% in glycerine. The higher index of refraction in glycerine means light interacts more strongly with the material and travels slower. This difference in speed is what causes refraction—when light enters these materials from air, it slows down and bends toward the normal. The larger the index of refraction, the more the light slows down and the more it bends.

What is the speed of light in air? In crown glass?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship between the speed of light in a medium, the speed of light in vacuum, and the index of refraction: $$n = c/v$$, which can be rearranged to $$v = c/n$$.

**Solution**

From [[Table 1]](#Table1), the index of refraction for air is $$n_{\text{air}} = 1.000293$$ and for crown glass is $$n_{\text{crown glass}} = 1.52$$.

For air:
<div class="equation">
$$v_{\text{air}} = \frac{c}{n_{\text{air}}} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.000293} = 2.9991 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

For crown glass:
<div class="equation">
$$v_{\text{crown glass}} = \frac{c}{n_{\text{crown glass}}} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.52} = 1.97 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The speed of light in air is only slightly less than the speed of light in vacuum (about 0.03% slower), which is why we often approximate $$n_{\text{air}} \approx 1.00$$ for most calculations. In crown glass, however, light travels at about 66% of its vacuum speed. This significant reduction in speed is what causes the bending of light (refraction) when it enters glass from air, which is the basis for lenses and many optical instruments.

<div class="equation">
$$n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{2.012 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 1.491$$

Comparing with [[Table 1]](#Table1), this value is very close to **polystyrene**, which has $$n = 1.49$$.

**Answer:** The index of refraction is **1.491**, and the substance is most likely **polystyrene**.

**Discussion**

Polystyrene is a common plastic used in many everyday items including disposable cups, packaging materials, and optical components. Its index of refraction (approximately 1.49) is similar to many other transparent plastics and glasses. The calculated value of 1.491 matches polystyrene within the precision of the measurement. In practice, the index of refraction can vary slightly depending on the exact composition and manufacturing process of the material, so small variations from the table value are expected.

**Strategy**

We use $$n = c/v$$ to calculate the index of refraction, then compare it with values in [[Table 1]](#Table1) to identify the substance.

<div class="equation">
$$n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{2.290 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 1.310$$

Comparing with [[Table 1]](#Table1), we find that water (fresh) has $$n = 1.333$$, which is close, and ice at $$-7°\text{C}$$ has $$n = 1.309$$, which matches our calculated value very closely.

**Answer:** The substance is ice (at $$-7°\text{C}$$).

**Discussion**

The slight difference between the index of refraction of water (1.333) and ice (1.309) is due to the different molecular structure. In ice, the water molecules are arranged in a crystalline lattice with more space between molecules than in liquid water, resulting in a slightly lower density and thus a slightly lower index of refraction. This allows light to travel slightly faster in ice than in liquid water.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Light travels at speed $$c = 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$ in the vacuum of space. We use $$t = d/c$$ to find the time, converting the distance to meters first.

**Solution**

Convert distance to meters:
<div class="equation">
$$d = 3.84 \times 10^{5} \text{ km} = 3.84 \times 10^{8} \text{ m}$$

Calculate time:

**Answer:** The light would arrive on Earth **1.28 seconds** after the asteroid hit the Moon.

**Discussion**

This remarkably short time—just over one second—shows how fast light travels. The Moon is Earth's closest celestial neighbor, and the short light-travel time means that when we look at the Moon, we're seeing it almost exactly as it is "now" (with only a 1.28-second delay). This historical observation by the Canterbury monks was likely of a major impact that created one of the Moon's craters. The event they described occurred in 1178 CE and has been suggested as possibly creating the crater Giordano Bruno, though this remains debated. The ability to see such an event from Earth demonstrates both the brightness of the impact and the short distance light must travel.

{: #Figure5}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use Snell's law to find the angle in air. Light is traveling from air into water, so $$n_1 = 1.00$$ (air) and $$n_2 = 1.333$$ (water). We're given $$\theta_2 = 25.0°$$ and need to find $$\theta_1$$.

**Solution**

Snell's law states:
<div class="equation">
$$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$
</div>

Solving for $$\theta_1$$:
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \sin \theta_2 = \frac{1.333}{1.00} \sin(25.0°)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_1 = 1.333 \times 0.4226 = 0.5634$$

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_1 = \sin^{-1}(0.5634) = 34.3°$$
</div>

**Answer:** The ray from the instructor's face makes an angle of **34.3°** with the perpendicular to the water surface.

**Discussion**

Note that the angle in air (34.3°) is larger than the angle in water (25.0°). This is expected because light bends toward the normal when entering a denser medium. This refraction effect causes the instructor to appear higher to the diver than she actually is, and conversely, it makes the diver appear shallower to the instructor. This is why objects underwater always appear closer to the surface than they actually are—an important safety consideration for diving and swimming.

Components of some computers communicate with each other through optical fibers having an index of refraction  $$n= 1.55 $$ .
 What time in nanoseconds is required for a signal to travel 0.200 m through such a fiber?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The speed of light in the fiber is $$v = c/n$$. We then use $$t = d/v$$ to find the travel time.

**Solution**

Speed of light in the fiber:
<div class="equation">
$$v = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.55} = 1.935 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Time for signal to travel 0.200 m:
<div class="equation">
$$t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{0.200 \text{ m}}{1.935 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 1.03 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s} = 1.03 \text{ ns}$$
</div>

**Answer:** The signal requires **1.03 nanoseconds** to travel through the fiber.

**Discussion**

Although this seems like an incredibly short time, it's significant in high-speed computing. Modern computer processors operate at gigahertz frequencies (billions of cycles per second), meaning each clock cycle lasts about 1 nanosecond. So this 1.03 ns delay represents roughly one clock cycle—enough to matter in computer design. This is why computer engineers carefully consider the length of connections and use optical fibers for longer distances within and between computers. The speed of light (even when slowed by the fiber's index of refraction) sets a fundamental limit on how fast signals can travel, affecting computer performance and design.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), we can use geometry and Snell's law. The horizontal distance from the point where the ray enters the water to the instructor is 2.00 m. We first find the angle in air using Snell's law (from the previous problem, $$\theta_1 = 34.3°$$), then use trigonometry.

**Solution**

**(a)** From the previous problem, we found $$\theta_1 = 34.3°$$.

The horizontal distance is 2.00 m. Using trigonometry:
<div class="equation">
$$\tan \theta_1 = \frac{\text{horizontal distance}}{\text{height}} = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{h}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$h = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{\tan(34.3°)} = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{0.6822} = 2.93 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**(b)** For the diver, the horizontal distance underwater is also 2.00 m, and $$\theta_2 = 25.0°$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\tan \theta_2 = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{d}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{\tan(25.0°)} = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{0.4663} = 4.29 \text{ m}$$
</div>

However, the actual depth is greater. The apparent depth can be found using $$d_{\text{apparent}} = d_{\text{actual}}/n = d_{\text{actual}}/1.333$$. From geometry, the actual depth is approximately 2.00/tan(25.0°) = 4.29 m, but the diver appears to be at:

$$d_{\text{apparent}} = 4.29/1.333 = 3.22 \text{ m}$$

**Discussion**

The instructor's head is 2.93 m above the water. The apparent depth effect makes underwater objects appear about 25% shallower than they actually are when viewed from air. This is why pools always look shallower than they really are.

 What is the index of refraction of the substance and its likely identity?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Light travels from water ($$n_1 = 1.333$$) into the unknown substance ($$n_2$$). We use Snell's law: $$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$ with $$\theta_1 = 45.0°$$ and $$\theta_2 = 40.3°$$.

**Solution**

Apply Snell's law:
<div class="equation">
$$n_2 = n_1 \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = 1.333 \times \frac{\sin(45.0°)}{\sin(40.3°)}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$n_2 = 1.333 \times \frac{0.7071}{0.6461} = 1.333 \times 1.094 = 1.458$$
</div>

Comparing with [[Table 1]](#Table1), this matches **fused quartz** ($$n = 1.458$$).

**Answer:** The index of refraction is **1.46** (to three significant figures), and the substance is most likely **fused quartz**.

**Discussion**

Fused quartz (also called fused silica) is a glass made by melting high-purity silica. It's commonly used in optical applications because of its excellent transparency, low thermal expansion, and resistance to thermal shock. The fact that the angle of refraction (40.3°) is less than the angle of incidence (45.0°) confirms that light is bending toward the normal, which is expected since the unknown substance has a higher index of refraction than water (1.458 > 1.333). This technique of measuring refraction angles to identify materials is used in gemology and materials science to distinguish between different transparent substances.

 and Earth's atmosphere (which varies in density with altitude) is equivalent to a layer 30.0 km thick with a constant index of refraction  $$n= 1.000293 $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Light travels slower in Earth's atmosphere than in vacuum. We need to find the additional time it takes to travel through the atmosphere (twice, since it's a round trip) and compare it to the total travel time.

**Solution**

Speed of light in the atmosphere:
<div class="equation">
$$v = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.000293} = 2.9991 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Time through atmosphere (round trip = 60.0 km total):
<div class="equation">
$$t_{\text{atm}} = \frac{60.0 \times 10^{3} \text{ m}}{2.9991 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 2.0006 \times 10^{-4} \text{ s}$$
</div>

Time if it were vacuum:
<div class="equation">
$$t_{\text{vac}} = \frac{60.0 \times 10^{3} \text{ m}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 2.000 \times 10^{-4} \text{ s}$$
</div>

Additional delay:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = t_{\text{atm}} - t_{\text{vac}} = (2.0006 - 2.000) \times 10^{-4} \text{ s} = 6 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}$$
</div>

This corresponds to an apparent additional distance:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta d = c \cdot \Delta t = (3.00 \times 10^{8})(6 \times 10^{-8}) = 18 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Percent correction:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta d}{2 \times 3.84 \times 10^{8} \text{ m}} \times 100\% = \frac{18}{7.68 \times 10^{8}} \times 100\% = 2.3 \times 10^{-6}\%$$
</div>

**Answer:** The percent correction needed is approximately **0.0000023%** or about **2.3 parts per million**.

**Discussion**

Although this correction is extremely small (only about 18 meters out of 768 million meters), it must be accounted for in precise laser ranging measurements to the Moon. Modern laser ranging can measure the Earth-Moon distance to within a few centimeters, making this atmospheric correction significant for such high-precision work. The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year, and these precise measurements help us track this motion.

**Strategy**

The ray refracts when entering the glass and again when leaving it. We need to find the lateral displacement $$\Delta x$$ by tracking the ray's path through the glass using Snell's law and geometry.

**Solution**

Entering the glass from air ($$n_1 = 1.00$$, $$n_2 = 1.52$$):
<div class="equation">
$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_1 = \frac{1.00}{1.52} \sin(40.0°) = \frac{0.6428}{1.52} = 0.4229$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\theta_2 = \sin^{-1}(0.4229) = 25.0°$$
</div>

The ray travels through the glass at angle $$25.0°$$ to the normal. The distance traveled through the glass:
<div class="equation">
$$d = \frac{t}{\cos \theta_2} = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm}}{\cos(25.0°)} = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm}}{0.9063} = 1.103 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

The horizontal displacement within the glass:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = d \sin \theta_2 = 1.103 \text{ cm} \times \sin(25.0°) = 1.103 \times 0.4226 = 0.466 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

However, we need to subtract the horizontal distance if the ray had traveled straight:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = t(\tan \theta_2 - \tan \theta_1) = 1.00(\tan 25.0° - \tan 40.0°)$$
</div>

Actually, the correct lateral displacement is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = t \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\cos \theta_2}$$
</div>

Let me recalculate more carefully. The lateral displacement for a parallel-sided plate is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = \frac{t \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}{\cos \theta_2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm} \times \sin(40.0° - 25.0°)}{\cos(25.0°)} = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm} \times \sin(15.0°)}{0.9063}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta x = \frac{1.00 \text{ cm} \times 0.2588}{0.9063} = 0.285 \text{ cm} = 2.85 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ray is displaced laterally by about 2.85 mm as it passes through the 1 cm thick glass. This displacement is why objects viewed through a window appear slightly shifted from their actual positions. The displacement depends on both the thickness of the glass and the angle of incidence—the greater the angle and the thicker the glass, the larger the displacement.

incidence of $$ 10.0º $$ and an angle of refraction of $$ 14.9º $$ .
(a) What is the index of refraction of the other substance? (b) What is
unreasonable about this result? (c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or
inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
(a) 0.898

(b) Can’t have $$n< 1.00 $$ since this would imply a speed greater than $$c $$.

(c) Refracted angle is too big relative to the angle of incidence.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider sunlight entering the Earth’s atmosphere at sunrise and sunset—that is,
at a $$90 ^\circ $$ incident angle. Taking the boundary between nearly empty
space and the atmosphere to be sudden, calculate the angle of refraction for
sunlight. This lengthens the time the Sun appears to be above the horizon, both
at sunrise and sunset. Now construct a problem in which you determine the angle
of refraction for different models of the atmosphere, such as various layers of
varying density. Your instructor may wish to guide you on the level of
complexity to consider and on how the index of refraction varies with air
density.

**Unreasonable Results**

Light traveling from water to a gemstone strikes the surface at an angle of $$
80.0º $$ and has an angle of refraction of $$ 15.2º $$ .
(a) What is the speed of light in the gemstone? (b) What is unreasonable about
this result? (c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
(a)  $$\frac{c}{ 5.00} $$
(b) Speed of light too slow, since index is much greater than that of diamond.

(c) Angle of refraction is unreasonable relative to the angle of incidence.
