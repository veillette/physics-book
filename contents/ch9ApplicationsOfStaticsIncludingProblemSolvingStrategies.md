Statics can be applied to a variety of situations, ranging from raising a
drawbridge to bad posture and back strain. We begin with a discussion of
problem-solving strategies specifically used for statics. Since statics is a
special case of Newton’s laws, both the general problem-solving strategies and
the special strategies for Newton’s laws, discussed
in [Problem-Solving Strategies](./ch4ProblemSolvingStrategies),
still apply.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Static Equilibrium Situations
</div>
1.  The first step is to determine whether or not the system is in **static equilibrium**. This condition is always the case when the *acceleration of the system is zero and accelerated rotation does not occur*.
2.  It is particularly important to *draw a free body diagram for the system of interest*. Carefully label all forces, and note their relative magnitudes, directions, and points of application whenever these are known.
3.  Solve the problem by applying either or both of the conditions for equilibrium (represented by the equations
 $$ \text{net}F=0 $$ and $$ \text{net}\tau =0 $$, depending on the
list of known and unknown factors. If the second condition is involved,
*choose the pivot point to simplify the solution*. Any pivot point can be chosen, but the most useful ones cause torques by unknown forces to be zero. (Torque is zero if the force is applied at the pivot (then
 $$ r=0 $$ ), or along a line through the pivot point (then
 $$ \theta =0 $$ )). Always choose a convenient coordinate system for
projecting forces.

4. _Check the solution to see if it is reasonable_ by examining the magnitude,
   direction, and units of the answer. The importance of this last step never
   diminishes, although in unfamiliar applications, it is usually more difficult
   to judge reasonableness. These judgments become progressively easier with
   experience.

</div>

Now let us apply this problem-solving strategy for the pole vaulter shown in the
three figures below. The pole is uniform and has a mass of 5.00 kg.
In [Figure 1](#Figure1), the pole’s cg lies halfway between the vaulter’s hands. It
seems reasonable that the force exerted by each hand is equal to half the weight
of the pole, or 24.5 N. This obviously satisfies the first condition for
equilibrium $$ \left( \text{net} F=0 \right) $$. The second condition $$ \left(
\text{net}\tau = 0 \right) $$ is also satisfied, as we can see by choosing the
cg to be the pivot point. The weight exerts no torque about a pivot point
located at the cg, since it is applied at that point and its lever arm is zero.
The equal forces exerted by the hands are equidistant from the chosen pivot, and
so they exert equal and opposite torques. Similar arguments hold for other
systems where supporting forces are exerted symmetrically about the cg. For
example, the four legs of a uniform table each support one-fourth of its weight.

In [Figure 1](#Figure1), a pole vaulter holding a pole with its cg halfway between
his hands is shown. Each hand exerts a force equal to half the weight of the
pole,$$ F*{R}=F*{L}=w/2 $$.
(b) The pole vaulter moves the pole to his left, and the forces that the hands
exert are no longer equal. See [Figure 1](#Figure1). If the pole is held with its
cg to the left of the person, then he must push down with his right hand and up
with his left. The forces he exerts are larger here because they are in opposite
directions and the cg is at a long distance from either hand.

Similar observations can be made using a meter stick held at different locations
along its length.

The center of gravity is to the left side of the vaulter.')
{: #Figure3}

If the pole vaulter holds the pole as shown in [Figure 2](#Figure2), the situation
is not as simple. The total force he exerts is still equal to the weight of the
pole, but it is not evenly divided between his hands. (If $$ F*
{L}=F*{R} $$, then the torques about the cg would not be equal since the lever
arms are different.) Logically, the right hand should support more weight, since
it is closer to the cg. In fact, if the right hand is moved directly under the
cg, it will support all the weight. This situation is exactly analogous to two
people carrying a load; the one closer to the cg carries more of its weight.
Finding the forces $$ F*{L} $$ and $$ F*{R} $$ is straightforward, as the next
example shows.

If the pole vaulter holds the pole from near the end of the
pole ([Figure 3](#Figure3)), the direction of the force applied by the right hand
of the vaulter reverses its direction.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
What Force Is Needed to Support a Weight Held Near Its CG?
</div>
For the situation shown in [Figure 2](#Figure2), calculate:
(a) $$ F_{R} $$, the force exerted by the right hand, and
(b) $$ F_{L} $$, the force exerted by the left hand. The hands are 0.900 m apart, and the cg of the pole is 0.600 m
from the left hand.

**Strategy**

[Figure 2](#Figure2) includes a free body diagram for the pole, the system of
interest. There is not enough information to use the first condition for
equilibrium, $$ \text{net}F=0 $$, since two of the three forces are unknown and
the hand forces cannot be assumed to be equal in this case. There is enough
information to use the second condition for equilibrium, $$ \text{net}\tau =0

$$
, if the pivot point is chosen to be at either hand, thereby making the torque
from that hand zero. We choose to locate the pivot at the left hand in this part
of the problem, to eliminate the torque from the left hand.

**Solution for (a)**

There are now only two nonzero torques, those from the gravitational force
( $$ \tau_{\text{w}} $$ ) and from the push or pull of the right hand
( $$\theta_{tau} $$). Stating the second condition in terms of clockwise and
counterclockwise torques,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{net} \tau_{\text{cw}}=\text{-net} \tau_{\text{ccw}} . $$
</div>
or the algebraic sum of the torques is zero.

Here this is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau_{R}=-\tau_{\text{w}} $$
</div>
since the weight of the pole creates a counterclockwise torque and the right hand counters with a clockwise torque.
Using the definition of torque, $$ \tau =rF\sin{\theta} $$, noting that $$ \theta =90^\circ $$,
and substituting known values, we obtain

<div class="equation">
 $$ \left(0.900 \m \right)\left(F_{R}\right)=\left(0.600 \m \right)\left(mg\right). $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
F_{R}&=& \left(0.667\right)\left(5.00 \kg \right)
\left(9.80\mss \right)\\
F_{R}&=& 32.7 \N .
\end{array}
$$

</div>

**Solution for (b)**

The first condition for equilibrium is based on the free body diagram in the
figure. This implies that by Newton’s second law:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{L}+F_{R}-mg =0 $$
</div>
From this we can conclude:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{L}+F_{R}=w=mg $$
</div>
Solving for $$ F_{L} $$, we obtain

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
F_{L}&=& mg-F_{R}\\
F_{L}&=& mg-32.7 N\\
F_{L}&=& \left(5.00 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)-32.7 \N \\
F_{L}&=& 16.3 \N
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

$$ F*{L} $$ is seen to be exactly half of $$ F*{R} $$, as we might have guessed,
since $$ F*{L} $$ is applied twice as far from the cg as $$ F*{R} $$.

</div>

If the pole vaulter holds the pole as he might at the start of a run, shown
in [Figure 3](#Figure3), the forces change again. Both are considerably greater,
and one force reverses direction.

### Summary

- Statics can be applied to a variety of situations, ranging from raising a
  drawbridge to bad posture and back strain. We have discussed the
  problem-solving strategies specifically useful for statics. Statics is a
  special case of Newton’s laws, both the general problem-solving strategies and
  the special strategies for Newton’s laws, discussed
  in [Problem-Solving Strategies](./ch4ProblemSolvingStrategies),
  still apply.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
When visiting some countries, you may see a person balancing a load on the head. Explain why the center of mass of the load needs to be directly above the person's neck vertebrae.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze the conditions for equilibrium when a load is balanced on the head. If the center of mass of the load is not directly above the point of support (the neck vertebrae), a net torque will result.

**Solution**

The center of mass of the load must be directly above the person's neck vertebrae for the following reasons:

1. **Zero torque condition:** When the load's center of mass is directly above the neck vertebrae, the weight of the load acts along a vertical line passing through the point of support. This means the lever arm for the weight is zero, and thus the torque about the neck is zero. No rotational tendency exists.

2. **Unstable equilibrium avoided:** If the load's center of mass is even slightly to one side of the vertebrae, the weight creates a torque that will cause the load to tip in that direction. The person would need to exert muscular force and shift their posture to counteract this torque.

3. **Energy efficiency:** With the load directly balanced, no muscular effort is needed to prevent rotation. The normal force from the head directly supports the weight. This allows people to carry heavy loads for long distances with minimal fatigue.

4. **Analogous to static equilibrium:** This is the same principle as balancing a pencil on its flat end—the center of gravity must be directly above the base of support for stable equilibrium.

**Discussion**

This carrying technique, common in many cultures, is remarkably efficient. Studies have shown that practiced head-load carriers can carry loads of up to 20% of their body weight with no additional metabolic cost compared to walking unloaded! This is because the balanced load requires no compensatory muscle effort. However, improper positioning of the load—even slightly off-center—dramatically increases the physical demand as muscles must constantly work to prevent the load from falling.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
To get up on the roof, a person (mass 70.0 kg) places a 6.00-m aluminum ladder (mass 10.0 kg) against the house on a concrete pad with the base of the ladder 2.00 m from the house. The ladder rests against a plastic rain gutter, which we can assume to be frictionless. The center of mass of the ladder is 2 m from the bottom. The person is standing 3 m from the bottom. What are the magnitudes of the forces on the ladder at the top and bottom?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a classic ladder problem. The ladder is in static equilibrium, so we apply both conditions for equilibrium. The frictionless wall means the force at the top is purely horizontal (normal to the wall). We first need to determine the geometry, then set up the force and torque equations.

**Solution**

**Step 1: Establish the geometry**

Given:

- Ladder length: $$ L = 6.00 \m $$
- Base distance from wall: $$ d = 2.00 \m $$
- Person mass: $$ m_p = 70.0 \kg $$
- Ladder mass: $$ m_L = 10.0 \kg $$
- Ladder cg: 2.00 m from bottom
- Person position: 3.00 m from bottom

Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the height where the ladder touches the wall:

<div class="equation">
$$ h = \sqrt{L^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{(6.00)^2 - (2.00)^2} = \sqrt{36 - 4} = \sqrt{32} = 5.66 \m $$
</div>

The angle the ladder makes with the horizontal:

<div class="equation">
$$ \cos\theta = \frac{d}{L} = \frac{2.00}{6.00} = 0.333, \quad \sin\theta = \frac{h}{L} = \frac{5.66}{6.00} = 0.943 $$
</div>

**Step 2: Identify forces**

- $$ N_w $$ = Normal force from wall (horizontal, at the top)
- $$ N_g $$ = Normal force from ground (vertical, at the bottom)
- $$ f $$ = Friction force from ground (horizontal, at the bottom)
- $$ W_L = m_L g = (10.0)(9.80) = 98.0 \N $$ (weight of ladder)
- $$ W_p = m_p g = (70.0)(9.80) = 686 \N $$ (weight of person)

**Step 3: Apply equilibrium conditions**

**Torque about the base of the ladder:** (This eliminates $$ N_g $$ and $$ f $$ from the equation)

The horizontal distances from the base (pivot) to where each force acts:

- Ladder cg: $$ (2.00 \m)\cos\theta = (2.00)(0.333) = 0.667 \m $$
- Person: $$ (3.00 \m)\cos\theta = (3.00)(0.333) = 1.00 \m $$
- Wall contact: $$ d = 2.00 \m $$

The vertical distance to where the wall force acts:

- Wall contact: $$ h = 5.66 \m $$

Setting counterclockwise torques equal to clockwise torques:

<div class="equation">
$$ N_w \cdot h = W_L \cdot (2.00\cos\theta) + W_p \cdot (3.00\cos\theta) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N_w (5.66 \m) = (98.0 \N)(0.667 \m) + (686 \N)(1.00 \m) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N_w (5.66) = 65.4 + 686 = 751.4 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ N_w = \frac{751.4}{5.66} = 133 \N $$
</div>

**Force equilibrium in the horizontal direction:**

<div class="equation">
$$ f = N_w = 133 \N $$
</div>

**Force equilibrium in the vertical direction:**

<div class="equation">
$$ N_g = W_L + W_p = 98.0 + 686 = 784 \N $$
</div>

**Step 4: Find the magnitudes**

Force at the **top** of the ladder (from the wall):

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{top} = N_w = 133 \N $$
</div>

Force at the **bottom** of the ladder (from the ground):

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{bottom} = \sqrt{N_g^2 + f^2} = \sqrt{(784)^2 + (133)^2} = \sqrt{614656 + 17689} = \sqrt{632345} = 795 \N $$
</div>

The direction of the force at the bottom (from the vertical):

<div class="equation">
$$ \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{f}{N_g}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{133}{784}\right) = 9.6° \text{ from vertical} $$
</div>

**Final Answers:**

- Force at the top: **133 N** (horizontal, away from wall)
- Force at the bottom: **795 N** (at 9.6° from vertical, or nearly vertical)

**Discussion**

The force at the bottom is nearly vertical because it must support the total weight of the person and ladder (784 N) while providing only a modest horizontal friction force (133 N) to prevent slipping. The wall, being frictionless, provides only a horizontal force that pushes the ladder away. This is why a ladder on a slippery floor is dangerous—if friction at the bottom is insufficient to provide the 133 N horizontal force needed, the ladder will slide out. The minimum coefficient of friction needed is $$ \mu\_{min} = f/N_g = 133/784 = 0.17 $$.

the pole. Explicitly show how you follow the steps in the Problem-Solving
Strategy for static equilibrium described above.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Following the Problem-Solving Strategy for static equilibrium:

1. Verify the system is in static equilibrium (the pole is stationary)
2. Draw a free body diagram and identify forces
3. Apply equilibrium conditions, choosing strategic pivot points
4. Check the solution for reasonableness

Given: Pole mass $$ m = 5.00 \kg $$ (from the earlier example), $$ W = mg = 49.0 \N $$

- Distance from left hand to cg: 2.00 m
- Distance between hands: 0.700 m
- Therefore, distance from right hand to cg: $$ 2.00 - 0.700 = 1.30 \m $$

In Figure 3, the cg is to the left of both hands, so the left hand must push UP while the right hand pushes DOWN to create the necessary torques.

**Solution for (a): Force by right hand**

Choose the left hand as the pivot point to eliminate $$ F_L $$ from the torque equation.

The weight creates a counterclockwise torque about the left hand (cg is to the left):
$$ \tau_W = W \times 2.00 \m = (49.0 \N)(2.00 \m) = 98.0 \text{ N·m} $$ (counterclockwise)

The right hand must create a clockwise torque to balance this:
$$ \tau_R = F_R \times 0.700 \m $$ (clockwise, so $$ F_R $$ is downward)

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_R \times 0.700 \m = 98.0 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_R = \frac{98.0}{0.700} = 140 \N $$
</div>

The right hand exerts a force of **140 N downward**.

**Solution for (b): Force by left hand**

Using the first condition for equilibrium (taking up as positive):

<div class="equation">
$$ F_L - W - F_R = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_L = W + F_R = 49.0 \N + 140 \N = 189 \N $$
</div>

The left hand exerts a force of **189 N upward**.

We can verify using torque about the right hand:
$$ F_L \times 0.700 \m = W \times (2.00 - 0.700) \m = (49.0)(1.30) = 63.7 \text{ N·m} $$

Check: $$ F_L = 63.7/0.700 = 91.0 \N $$...

Wait, let me reconsider the geometry. Looking at Figure 3, the cg is to the LEFT of the vaulter's hands. So if the left hand is at position 0, the cg is at position -2.00 m (to the left), and the right hand is at position +0.700 m (to the right of the left hand).

Let me redo this calculation with proper signs.

Actually, re-reading the problem: "the cg of the pole is 2.00 m from the left hand" with the cg to the LEFT of the left hand (as shown in Figure 3).

About the right hand as pivot:

- Distance from right hand to cg: $$ 2.00 + 0.700 = 2.70 \m $$
- Distance from right hand to left hand: $$ 0.700 \m $$

$$ W \times 2.70 \m = F_L \times 0.700 \m $$
$$ (49.0)(2.70) = F_L (0.700) $$
$$ F_L = \frac{132.3}{0.700} = 189 \N $$ (upward) ✓ This confirms part (b).

**Solution for (c): Verifying equilibrium with an alternative pivot**

Let's verify equilibrium using a pivot point at the right hand instead of the cg.

**Step 1:** The system is in static equilibrium—the pole is held motionless.

**Step 2:** Free body diagram shows:

- Weight $$ W = 49.0 \N $$ acting downward at the cg (which is at the center of the pole)
- $$ F_L = W/2 = 24.5 \N $$ acting upward at the left hand
- $$ F_R = W/2 = 24.5 \N $$ acting upward at the right hand

In Figure 1, the hands are equidistant from the cg (at the center of the pole).

**Step 3:** Choose the right hand as the pivot point.

If the pole has its cg at the center and hands are symmetrically placed (Figure 1), let the distance from each hand to the cg be $$ d $$. The hands are some distance $$ 2d $$ apart.

About the right hand:

- Torque from $$ W $$: $$ \tau_W = W \times d $$ (clockwise, negative)
- Torque from $$ F_L $$: $$ \tau_L = F_L \times 2d $$ (counterclockwise, positive)
- Torque from $$ F_R $$: $$ \tau_R = 0 $$ (at the pivot)

For equilibrium:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_L \times 2d - W \times d = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_L \times 2d = W \times d $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_L = \frac{W}{2} $$
</div>

Since $$ F_L = W/2 $$, the equation is satisfied: $$ (W/2)(2d) = Wd $$ ✓

The second condition for equilibrium is satisfied for the pivot at the right hand position.

**Step 4: Reasonableness check**

The result makes physical sense: when the cg is centered between the hands, each hand supports half the weight. The torques balance about any point because the system is in equilibrium—this is a fundamental property of equilibrium systems.

**Discussion**

Parts (a) and (b) show that when the cg is far from the hands (as in Figure 3), the forces become much larger than the weight of the pole. The right hand must push down with 140 N (almost 3 times the pole's weight!), while the left hand must push up with 189 N (almost 4 times the weight). This explains why holding a pole near one end is so much more tiring than holding it near the center. Part (c) demonstrates that the choice of pivot point is arbitrary for equilibrium analysis—any pivot will give consistent results when a system is truly in equilibrium.
