Torque
</div>
The second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium involves avoiding accelerated rotation (maintaining a constant angular velocity). A rotating body or system can be in equilibrium if its rate of rotation is constant and remains unchanged by the forces acting on it. To understand what factors affect rotation, let us think about what happens when you open an ordinary door by rotating it on its hinges.

</div>

Several familiar factors determine how effective you are in opening the door.
See [Figure 1](#Figure1). First, the larger the force, the more effective it is in
opening the door—obviously, the harder you push, the more rapidly the door
opens. Also, the point at which you push is crucial. If you apply your force too
close to the hinges, the door will open slowly, if at all. Most people have been
embarrassed by making this mistake and bumping up against a door when it did not
open as quickly as expected. Finally, the direction in which you push is also
important. The most effective direction is perpendicular to the door—we push in
this direction almost instinctively.

![In the figure, six top views of a door are shown. In the first figure, a force vector is shown in the North West direction. The perpendicular distance of the force from the point of rotation is r. In the second figure, a force is applied in the opposite direction at the same distance from the hinges. In the third figure, a smaller force in applied at the same point. In the next figure, a horizontal force is applied at the same point. In this case, the perpendicular distance from the hinges is shown as r sin theta. In the next figure, force is applied at a distance near the hinges. In the final figure, the force is shown along the direction of hinges toward the handle of the door.](../resources/Figure_09_02_01.jpg 'Torque is the turning or twisting effectiveness of a force, illustrated here for door rotation on its hinges (as viewed from overhead). Torque has both magnitude and direction. (a) Counterclockwise torque is produced by this force, which means that the door will rotate in a counterclockwise due to ( F ) . Note that ( r_\\perp ) is the perpendicular distance of the pivot from the line of action of the force.
(b) A smaller counterclockwise torque is produced by a smaller force ( F^\\prime ) acting at the same distance from the hinges (the pivot point).
(c) The same force as in (a) produces a smaller counterclockwise torque when applied at a smaller distance from the hinges. (d) The same force as in (a), but acting in the opposite direction, produces a clockwise torque. (e) A smaller counterclockwise torque is produced by the same magnitude force acting at the same point but in a different direction. Here, ( \\theta ) is less than 90º. (f) Torque is zero here since the force just pulls on the hinges, producing no rotation. In this case, ( \\theta= 0^\\circ ) .')
{: #Figure1}

The magnitude, direction, and point of application of the force are incorporated
into the definition of the physical quantity called torque. **Torque** is the
rotational equivalent of a force. It is a measure of the effectiveness of a
force in changing or accelerating a rotation (changing the angular velocity over
a period of time). In equation form, the magnitude of torque is defined to be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau =rF\sin{\theta} $$
</div>

where $$ \tau $$
(the Greek letter tau) is the symbol for torque, $$ r $$ is the distance from
the pivot point to the point where the force is applied, $$ F $$ is the
magnitude of the force, and $$ \theta $$ is the angle between the force and the
vector directed from the point of application to the pivot point, as seen
in [Figure 1](#Figure1)
and [Figure 2](#Figure2). An alternative expression for torque is given in terms of
the **perpendicular lever arm** $$ r\_{\perp } $$ as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1)
and [Figure 2](#Figure2), which is defined as

<div class="equation">
 $$ r_{\perp }=r\sin{\theta} $$
</div>

so that

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau =r_{\perp }F. $$
</div>

![In the first part of the figure, a hockey stick is shown. At a point A near the bottom, a nail is fixed. A force is applied at a point near the holding grip of the hockey stick. A quarter circular arrow shows that the stick rotates in the counterclockwise direction. The perpendicular distance between the pivot point and the force vector direction is labeled as r-perpendicular, and the angle between the direction of force and the line joining the pivot A to the point of application of force is given as theta. In the second part of the figure, the pivot point is near the top of the stick and the point of application of the force is about the same as that in the first part of the figure. An upward quarter circle arrow shows that the stick rotates in the clockwise direction.](../resources/Figure_09_02_02.jpg 'A force applied to an object can produce a torque, which depends on the location of the pivot point. (a) The three factors r, F, and ( \\theta ) for pivot point A on a body are shown here—r is the distance from the chosen pivot point to the point where the force F is applied, and θ is the angle between F and the vector directed from the point of application to the pivot point. If the object can rotate around point A, it will rotate counterclockwise. This means that torque is counterclockwise relative to pivot A.
(b) In this case, point B is the pivot point. The torque from the applied force will cause a clockwise rotation around point B, and so it is a clockwise torque relative to B.
      ')
{: #Figure2}

The perpendicular lever arm $$ r_{\perp } $$ is the shortest distance from the
pivot point to the line along which $$ \vb{F} $$ acts; it is shown as a dashed
line in [Figure 1](#Figure1)
and [Figure 2](#Figure2). Note that the line segment that defines the distance $$ r_{\perp } $$ is perpendicular to $$ \vb{F} $$, as its name implies. It is
sometimes easier to find or visualize $$ r_{\perp } $$ than to find both $$ r $$
and $$ \theta $$. In such cases, it may be more convenient to use $$ \tau =r_ {\perp }F $$ rather than $$ \tau =rF\sin{\theta} $$ for torque, but both are
equally valid.

The **SI unit of torque** is newtons times meters, usually written as $$ \N ·\m $$

. For example, if you push perpendicular to the door with a force of 40 N at a
distance of 0.800 m from the hinges, you exert a torque of $$ 32 \text{N·m} ( 0.800 \m · 40 \N \sin{90^\circ} ) $$ relative to the hinges. If you reduce the
force to 20 N, the torque is reduced to $$ 16 \text{N·m} $$, and so on.

The torque is always calculated with reference to some chosen pivot point. For
the same applied force, a different choice for the location of the pivot will
give you a different value for the torque, since both $$ r $$ and $$ \theta $$
depend on the location of the pivot. Any point in any object can be chosen to
calculate the torque about that point. The object may not actually pivot about
the chosen “pivot point.”

Note that for rotation in a plane, torque has two possible directions. Torque is
either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the chosen pivot point, as
illustrated for points B and A, respectively, in [Figure 2](#Figure2). If the
object can rotate about point A, it will rotate counterclockwise, which means
that the torque for the force is shown as counterclockwise relative to A. But if
the object can rotate about point B, it will rotate clockwise, which means the
torque for the force shown is clockwise relative to B. Also, the magnitude of
the torque is greater when the lever arm is longer.

Now, *the second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium* is that *the net
external torque on a system must be zero*. An external torque is one that is
created by an external force. You can choose the point around which the torque
is calculated. The point can be the physical pivot point of a system or any
other point in space—but it must be the same point for all torques. If the
second condition (net external torque on a system is zero) is satisfied for one
choice of pivot point, it will also hold true for any other choice of pivot
point in or out of the system of interest. (This is true only in an inertial
frame of reference.) The second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is
stated in equation form as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{net}\tau =0 $$
</div>

where net means total. Torques, which are in opposite directions are assigned
opposite signs. A common convention is to call counterclockwise (ccw) torques
positive and clockwise (cw) torques negative.

When two children balance a seesaw as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure3), they satisfy
the two conditions for equilibrium. Most people have perfect intuition about
seesaws, knowing that the lighter child must sit farther from the pivot and that
a heavier child can keep a lighter one off the ground indefinitely.

![Two children are sitting on a seesaw. On the left side, a lighter child is sitting and on the right, a heavier one. The distance of the lighter child from the fulcrum is more than that of heavier child. At the fulcrum, an upward force vector labeled as F-p is shown. The weights of the two children, w-one and w-two, are shown as vectors in the downward direction, and the force at the fulcrum, F-p, is shown as a vector in the upward direction.](../resources/Figure_09_02_03.jpg "Two children balancing a seesaw satisfy both conditions for equilibrium. The lighter child sits farther from the pivot to create a torque equal in magnitude to that of the heavier child.")

<div class="title">
She Saw Torques On A Seesaw
</div>
The two children shown in [Figure 3](#Figure3) are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass.
(This assumption is made to keep the example simple—more involved examples will follow.)
The first child has a mass of 26.0 kg and sits 1.60 m from the pivot.
(a) If the second child has a mass of 32.0 kg, how far is she from the pivot?
(b) What is $$ F_{\text{p}} $$, the supporting force exerted by the pivot?

**Strategy**

Both conditions for equilibrium must be satisfied. In part (a), we are asked for
a distance; thus, the second condition (regarding torques) must be used, since
the first (regarding only forces) has no distances in it. To apply the second
condition for equilibrium, we first identify the system of interest to be the
seesaw plus the two children. We take the supporting pivot to be the point about
which the torques are calculated. We then identify all external forces acting on
the system.

**Solution (a)**

The three external forces acting on the system are the weights of the two
children and the supporting force of the pivot. Let us examine the torque
produced by each. Torque is defined to be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau =rF\sin{\theta} . $$
</div>
Here $$ \theta =90^\circ $$, so that $$ \sin{\theta} =1 $$ for all three forces.
That means $$ r_{\perp }=r $$ for all three. The torques exerted by the three forces are first,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau_{1}=r_{1}w_{1} $$
</div>
second,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau_{2}=-r_{2}w_{2} $$
</div>
and third,

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
\tau_{\text{p}}&=& r_{\text{p}}{F}_{\text{p}}\\
\tau_{\text{p}}&=& 0\cdot F_{\text{p}}\\
\tau_{\text{p}}&=& 0.
\end{array}
$$

</div>
Note that a minus sign has been inserted into the second equation because this torque is clockwise and is therefore negative by convention. Since $$ F_{\text{p}} $$ acts directly on the pivot point, the distance $$ r_{\text{p}} $$
is zero. A force acting on the pivot cannot cause a rotation, just as pushing
directly on the hinges of a door will not cause it to rotate. Now, the second
condition for equilibrium is that the sum of the torques on both children is
zero. Therefore

<div class="equation">
 $$ \tau_{2}=-\tau_{1}, $$
</div>
or

<div class="equation">
 $$ r_{2}w_{2}=r_{1}w_{1}. $$
</div>
Weight is mass times the acceleration due to gravity. Entering $$ mg $$ for $$ w $$, we get

<div class="equation">
 $$ r_{2}m_{2}g=r_{1}m_{1}g. $$
</div>
Solve this for the unknown $$ r_{2} $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ r_{2}=r_{1}\frac{ m_{1}}{ m_{2}}. $$
</div>
The quantities on the right side of the equation are known; thus, $$ r_{2} $$ is

<div class="equation">
 $$ r_{2}=\left(1.60 \m \right)\frac{26.0 \kg }{32.0 \kg }=1.30 \m . $$
</div>
As expected, the heavier child must sit closer to the pivot (1.30 m versus 1.60 m) to balance the seesaw.

**Solution (b)**

This part asks for a force $$ F\_{\text{p}} $$. The easiest way to find it is to
use the first condition for equilibrium, which is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{net}\vb{F}=0. $$
</div>
The forces are all vertical, so that we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem along the vertical axis; hence, the condition can be written as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{net} F_{y}=0 $$
</div>
where we again call the vertical axis the *y*-axis. Choosing upward to be the positive direction, and using plus and minus signs to indicate the directions of the forces, we see that

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}}-w_{1}-w_{2}=0. $$
</div>
This equation yields what might have been guessed at the beginning:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}}=w_{1}+w_{2}. $$
</div>
So, the pivot supplies a supporting force equal to the total weight of the system:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}}=m_{1}g+m_{2}g. $$
</div>
Entering known values gives

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
F_{\text{p}}&=& \left(26.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)+\left(32.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)\\
F_{\text{p}}&=& 568 \N .
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The two results make intuitive sense. The heavier child sits closer to the
pivot. The pivot supports the weight of the two children. Part (b) can also be
solved using the second condition for equilibrium, since both distances are
known, but only if the pivot point is chosen to be somewhere other than the
location of the seesaw’s actual pivot!

</div>

Several aspects of the preceding example have broad implications. First, the
choice of the pivot as the point around which torques are calculated simplified
the problem. Since $$ F_{\text{p}} $$ is exerted on the pivot point, its lever
arm is zero. Hence, the torque exerted by the supporting force $$ F_{\text{p}} $$

is zero relative to that pivot point. The second condition for equilibrium
holds for any choice of pivot point, and so we choose the pivot point to
simplify the solution of the problem.

Second, the acceleration due to gravity canceled in this problem, and we were
left with a ratio of masses. *This will not always be the case*. Always enter
the correct forces—do not jump ahead to enter some ratio of masses.

Third, the weight of each child is distributed over an area of the seesaw, yet
we treated the weights as if each force were exerted at a single point. This is
not an approximation—the distances $$ r_{1} $$ and $$ r_{2} $$ are the distances
to points directly below the **center of gravity** of each child. As we shall
see in the next section, the mass and weight of a system can act as if they are
located at a single point.

Finally, note that the concept of torque has an importance beyond static
equilibrium. *Torque plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays
in linear motion.* We will examine this in the next chapter.

Take a piece of modeling clay and put it on a table, then mash a cylinder down into it so that a ruler can balance on the round side of the cylinder while everything remains still. Put a penny 8 cm away from the pivot. Where would you need to put two pennies to balance? Three pennies?

### Section Summary

* The second condition assures those torques are also balanced. Torque is the
  rotational equivalent of a force in producing a rotation and is defined to be
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \tau =rF\sin{\theta} $$
  </div>

where $$ \tau $$ is torque, $$ r $$ is the distance from the pivot point to the
point where the force is applied, $$ F $$ is the magnitude of the force, and $$ \theta $$ is the angle between $$ \vb{F} $$ and the vector directed from the
point where the force acts to the pivot point. The perpendicular lever arm $$ r_ {\perp } $$ is defined to be

  <div class="equation">
 $$ r_{\perp }=r\sin{\theta} $$
  </div>

so that

  <div class="equation">
 $$ \tau =r_{\perp }F. $$
  </div>

* The perpendicular lever arm $$ r_{\perp } $$ is the shortest distance from the
  pivot point to the line along which $$ F $$ acts. The SI unit for torque is
  newton-meter $$ \text{(N·m)} $$. The second condition necessary to achieve
  equilibrium is that the net external torque on a system must be zero:
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \text{net}\tau =0 $$

By convention, counterclockwise torques are positive, and clockwise torques are
negative.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What three factors affect the torque created by a force relative to a specific pivot point?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We analyze the torque equation $$ \tau = rF\sin{\theta} $$ to identify the three factors that determine torque magnitude.

**Solution**

The three factors that affect the torque created by a force relative to a specific pivot point are:

1. **The magnitude of the force ($$ F $$)**: Greater force produces greater torque. Pushing harder on a door makes it rotate faster.

2. **The distance from the pivot point to where the force is applied ($$ r $$)**: Greater distance produces greater torque. Pushing a door near the handle (far from the hinges) is more effective than pushing near the hinges.

3. **The angle between the force and the lever arm ($$ \theta $$)**: Maximum torque occurs when the force is perpendicular to the lever arm ($$ \theta = 90° $$, so $$ \sin{\theta} = 1 $$). When the force is parallel to the lever arm ($$ \theta = 0° $$ or $$ 180° $$), no torque is produced.

**Discussion**

These three factors are combined in the torque equation $$ \tau = rF\sin{\theta} $$, or equivalently $$ \tau = r_{\perp}F $$ where $$ r_{\perp} = r\sin{\theta} $$ is the perpendicular lever arm. Understanding these factors is essential for designing mechanical systems like levers, wrenches, and door handles.

A wrecking ball is being used to knock down a building. One tall unsupported concrete wall remains
standing. If the wrecking ball hits the wall near the top, is the wall more likely to fall over by
rotating at its base or by falling straight down? Explain your answer. How is it most likely to
fall if it is struck with the same force at its base? Note that this depends on how firmly the wall is attached at its base.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply the concept of torque to analyze how the point of force application affects the wall's response. The base of the wall acts as a pivot point for rotation.

**Solution**

**When struck near the top:** The wall is more likely to **fall over by rotating at its base**. Here's why:

- The impact force applied near the top creates a large torque about the base because the lever arm (distance from the base to the point of impact) is maximum.
- Using $$ \tau = rF $$, if $$ r $$ (the height of impact) is large, the torque is large.
- This large torque causes significant angular acceleration, making the wall rotate about its base.
- The wall's rotational inertia cannot resist this large torque, so it topples over.

**When struck at the base:** The wall is more likely to **slide or crumble rather than rotate**, or it may fall straight down:

- The impact force applied at the base creates minimal torque because the lever arm approaches zero ($$ r \approx 0 $$).
- With negligible torque, there is no tendency to rotate.
- Instead, the force acts to translate (push) the wall or to shatter it at the point of impact.
- If the wall is firmly attached at its base, the impact may cause localized crushing at the base, leading to the wall collapsing straight down.

**Discussion**

This principle is used in controlled demolitions. Explosives or wrecking balls applied at the base cause buildings to collapse straight down into their footprint, while impacts higher up can cause unpredictable toppling. The same physics explains why it's easier to tip over a tall bookshelf by pushing at the top rather than at the bottom.

Mechanics sometimes put a length of pipe over the handle of a wrench when trying to remove a very
tight bolt. How does this help? (It is also hazardous since it can break the bolt.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply the torque equation $$ \tau = rF $$ to understand how extending the lever arm affects the torque produced.

**Solution**

Adding a pipe over the wrench handle **increases the torque** applied to the bolt by increasing the lever arm (the distance $$ r $$ from the bolt to where the force is applied).

From the torque equation $$ \tau = rF\sin{\theta} $$:
- The force $$ F $$ the mechanic can apply is limited by their strength
- The angle is typically kept at 90° for maximum effectiveness
- By extending the handle with a pipe, the distance $$ r $$ is increased

For example, if a wrench handle is 20 cm long and a 40 cm pipe is added, the new lever arm is 60 cm—three times longer. This triples the torque produced for the same applied force.

**Why it's hazardous:** The increased torque can exceed what the bolt was designed to withstand, causing:
- The bolt to shear off (break)
- The bolt threads to strip
- The wrench to slip suddenly when the bolt breaks loose, potentially causing injury

**Discussion**

This is a practical application of the torque equation. The same principle explains why longer wrenches are used for tighter bolts, why door handles are placed far from hinges, and why long-handled tools make work easier. However, the increased mechanical advantage comes with the risk of applying excessive force, which is why proper-sized tools and torque wrenches are important in precision applications.

When tightening a bolt, you push perpendicularly on a wrench with a force of 165 N at a distance of 0.140 m from the center of the bolt.
(a) How much torque are you exerting in newton × meters (relative to the center of the bolt)?
(b) Convert this torque to footpounds.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the torque equation $$ \tau = rF\sin{\theta} $$. Since the force is applied perpendicularly, $$ \theta = 90° $$ and $$ \sin{\theta} = 1 $$. For part (b), we use the conversion factor between newton-meters and foot-pounds.

**Solution for (a)**

Using the torque equation with $$ \theta = 90° $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau = rF\sin{\theta} = rF\sin{90°} = rF $$
</div>

Substituting the given values:

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau = (0.140 \m)(165 \N) = 23.1 \text{ N·m} $$
</div>

The torque exerted on the bolt is **23.1 N·m**.

**Solution for (b)**

The conversion factor is: $$ 1 \text{ N·m} = 0.7376 \text{ ft·lb} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau = 23.1 \text{ N·m} \times \frac{0.7376 \text{ ft·lb}}{1 \text{ N·m}} = 17.0 \text{ ft·lb} $$
</div>

The torque in foot-pounds is **17.0 ft·lb**.

**Discussion**

This torque value is typical for tightening automotive fasteners. Many car manuals specify torque values in foot-pounds (common in the US) or newton-meters (common elsewhere). A torque wrench calibrated in either unit helps ensure bolts are tightened to specifications, preventing both overtightening (which can strip threads or break bolts) and undertightening (which can cause bolts to loosen over time).

Use the second condition for equilibrium $$ \text{(net τ = 0)} $$ to calculate $$ F_{\text{p}} $$
in [Example 1](#example1), employing any data given or solved for in part (a)
of the example.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply the second condition for equilibrium (net torque equals zero) using a pivot point other than the actual pivot of the seesaw. By choosing a different pivot point—such as the location of one of the children—the unknown force $$ F_{\text{p}} $$ will have a non-zero lever arm and will appear in the torque equation.

From Example 1: $$ m_1 = 26.0 \kg $$, $$ r_1 = 1.60 \m $$, $$ m_2 = 32.0 \kg $$, $$ r_2 = 1.30 \m $$

**Solution**

Let us choose the position of child 1 (the 26.0 kg child) as our pivot point. From this pivot:

- The torque due to $$ w_1 $$ is zero (since it acts at the pivot)
- The lever arm for $$ F_{\text{p}} $$ is $$ r_1 = 1.60 \m $$ (distance from child 1 to the pivot)
- The lever arm for $$ w_2 $$ is $$ r_1 + r_2 = 1.60 \m + 1.30 \m = 2.90 \m $$

Applying the second condition for equilibrium (taking counterclockwise as positive):

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{net}\tau = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \tau_{F_p} - \tau_{w_2} = 0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}} \cdot r_1 - w_2 \cdot (r_1 + r_2) = 0 $$
</div>

Solving for $$ F_{\text{p}} $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}} = \frac{w_2(r_1 + r_2)}{r_1} = \frac{m_2 g(r_1 + r_2)}{r_1} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}} = \frac{(32.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss)(2.90 \m)}{1.60 \m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{p}} = \frac{909.4 \text{ N·m}}{1.60 \m} = 568 \N $$
</div>

The supporting force exerted by the pivot is **568 N**.

**Discussion**

This result agrees with the answer obtained using the first condition for equilibrium in Example 1. The fact that we get the same answer using either method confirms that both conditions for equilibrium are satisfied simultaneously. This problem demonstrates that the choice of pivot point is arbitrary when applying the second condition for equilibrium—any choice will give the correct answer if the system is truly in equilibrium. Choosing a strategic pivot point (like the location of one of the forces) can simplify the calculation by eliminating that force's torque from the equation.

m_{1}&=& 26.0 \kg ,m_{2}=32.0 \kg , m_{\s}=12.0 \kg ,\\
r_{1}&=& 1.60 \m , r_{\s}=0.160 \m , \text{find (a)}r_{2,}\text{(b)}{F}_{\text{p}}

a) Since children are balancing:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{} $$
\text{net}{\tau }_{\text{cw}}=-\text{net}{\tau }_{\text{ccw}}\\
⇒w_{1}r_{1}+m_{\s}{gr}_{\s}=w_{2}r_{2}\\
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>
So, solving for $$ r_{2} $$ gives:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
r_{2}&=& \frac{ w_{1}r_{1}+m_{\s}{gr}_{\s}}{ w_{2}}=\frac{ m_{1}{gr}_{1}+m_{\s}{gr}_{\s}}{ m_{2}g}=\frac{ m_{1}r_{1}+m_{\s}r_{\s}}{ m_{2}}\\
r_{2}&=& \frac{ \left(26.0 \kg \right)\left(1.60 \m \right)+\left(12.0 \kg \right)\left(0.160 \m \right)}{32.0 \kg }\\
r_{2}&=& 1.36 \m
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>
b) Since the children are not moving:

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{} $$
\text{net}F=0=F_{\text{p}}-w_{1}-w_{2}-w_{\s}\\ 
⇒{F}_{\text{p}}=w_{1}+w_{2}+w_{s}
\end{array} $$ $$
</div>
So that

<div class="equation">
$$ \begin{array}{lll} $$
F_{\text{p}}&=& \left(26.0 \kg +32.0 \kg +12.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)\\
F_{\text{p}}&=& 686 \N
\end{array} $$ $$
