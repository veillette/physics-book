Have you ever driven on a road that seems like it goes on forever? If you look
ahead, you might say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say
the road ahead looks like it’s about 15 km long. If you both measured the road,
however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both
measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is
not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured
are not the same when measured by different observers.

### Proper Length

One thing all observers agree upon is relative speed. Even though clocks measure
different elapsed times for the same process, they still agree that relative
speed, which is distance divided by elapsed time, is the same. This implies that
distance, too, depends on the observer’s relative motion. If two observers see
different times, then they must also see different distances for relative speed
to be the same to each of them.

The muon discussed in [[Example 1]](../contents/ch28SimultaneityAndTimeDilation#Example1) illustrates this concept.
To an observer on the Earth, the muon travels at $$0.950c $$ for $$7.05 \mu s $$
from the time it is produced until it decays. Thus it travels a distance

<div class="equation" >
 $${L}_{0}=v\Delta t=\left(0.950\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)\left( 7.05 \times 10^{-6}  \text{s}\right)=2.01 \text{km} $$
</div>

relative to the Earth. In the muon’s frame of reference, its lifetime is only
$$2.20 \mu s $$ . It has enough time to travel only

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=v\Delta {t}_{0}=\left( 0.950\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)\left( 2.20 \times 10^{-6}  \text{s}\right)=0.627\text{ km}. $$
</div>

The distance between the same two events (production and decay of a muon)
depends on who measures it and how they are moving relative to it.

<div class="title">
Proper Length
</div>
<strong class="term" >Proper length </strong> $${L}_{0} $$
 is the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to both of the points.

</div>

The Earth-bound observer measures the proper length $${L}_{0} $$ , because the
points at which the muon is produced and decays are stationary relative to the
Earth. To the muon, the Earth, air, and clouds are moving, and so the distance
$$L $$ it sees is not the proper length.

![In part a observer observes from ground frame of reference a muon above earth with speed v in the rightward direction. The distance between the muon and the place where it disintegrates is two point zero one. In part b the system is shown in motion having velocity v in the leftward direction. So, the cloud and ground are displaced zero point six two seven kilo meter in the opposite direction.](../resources/Figure_28_03_02.jpg '(a) The Earth-bound observer sees the muon travel 2.01 km between clouds. (b) The muon sees itself travel the same path, but only a distance of 0.627 km. The Earth, air, and clouds are moving relative to the muon in its frame, and all appear to have smaller lengths along the direction of travel.')

### Length Contraction

To develop an equation relating distances measured by different observers, we
note that the velocity relative to the Earth-bound observer in our muon example
is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>

The time relative to the Earth-bound observer is $$\Delta t $$ , since the
object being timed is moving relative to this observer. The velocity relative to
the moving observer is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{L}{\Delta {t}_{0}}. $$
</div>

The moving observer travels with the muon and therefore observes the proper time
$$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ . The two velocities are identical; thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\Delta t}=\frac{L}{\Delta {t}_{0}}. $$
</div>

We know that $$\Delta t=\gamma \Delta {t}_{0} $$ . Substituting this equation
into the relationship above gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\gamma }. $$
</div>

Substituting for $$\gamma $$ gives an equation relating the distances measured
by different observers.

<div class="title">
**Length Contraction**
</div>
<strong class="term" >Length contraction </strong> $$L $$
 is the shortening of the measured length of an object moving relative to the observer’s frame.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L={L}_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}. $$
</div>
</div>

If we measure the length of anything moving relative to our frame, we find its
length $$L $$ to be smaller than the proper length $${L}_{0} $$ that would be
measured if the object were stationary. For example, in the muon’s reference
frame, the distance between the points where it was produced and where it
decayed is shorter. Those points are fixed relative to the Earth but moving
relative to the muon. Clouds and other objects are also contracted along the
direction of motion in the muon’s reference frame.

Calculating Length Contraction: The Distance between Stars Contracts when You Travel at High Velocity
</div>
Suppose an astronaut, such as the twin discussed in [Simultaneity and Time Dilation](../contents/ch28SimultaneityAndTimeDilation), travels so fast that  $$\gamma = 30.00  $$ .
 (a) She travels from the Earth to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, 4.300 light years (ly) away as measured by an Earth-bound observer. How far apart are the Earth and Alpha Centauri as measured by the astronaut? (b) In terms of  $$c $$ ,
 what is her velocity relative to the Earth? You may neglect the motion of the Earth relative to the Sun. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![In part a the distance between the earth and the alpha centauri is measured as L-zero. A clock given in this figure is showing a time delta-t. A spaceship flying with velocity of v equals L-zero over delta-t from the earth to the star is shown. Part b shows the spaceship frame of reference from which the distance L between the earth and star is contracted as they seem to move with same velocity in opposite direction. In part b the clock shows less time elapsed than the clock in part a.](../resources/Figure_28_03_03.jpg '(a) The Earth-bound observer measures the proper distance between the Earth and the Alpha Centauri. (b) The astronaut observes a length contraction, since the Earth and the Alpha Centauri move relative to her ship. She can travel this shorter distance in a smaller time (her proper time) without exceeding the speed of light.')
{: #Figure3}

**Strategy**

First note that a light year (ly) is a convenient unit of distance on an
astronomical scale—it is the distance light travels in a year. For part (a),
note that the 4.300 ly distance between the Alpha Centauri and the Earth is the
proper distance $${L}_{0} $$ , because it is measured by an Earth-bound observer
to whom both objects are (approximately) stationary. To the astronaut, the Earth
and the Alpha Centauri are moving by at the same velocity, and so the distance
between them is the contracted length $$L $$ . In part (b), we are given
$$\gamma $$ , and so we can find $$v $$ by rearranging the definition of
$$\gamma $$ to express $$v $$ in terms of $$c $$.

**Solution for (a)**

1. Identify the knowns. $${L}_{0}-4.300 \text{ly} $$ ; $$\gamma = 30.00 $$
2. Identify the unknown. $$L $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$L=\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\gamma } $$
4. Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown.
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\begin{array}{lll}L& =& \frac{ {L}_{0}}{\gamma }\\ & =& \frac{4.300
   \text{ly}}{30.00}\\ & =& 0.1433 \text{ly}\end{array} $$
   </div>

**Solution for (b)**

1. Identify the known. $$\gamma = 30.00 $$
2. Identify the unknown. $$v $$ in terms of $$c $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}} $$
4. Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown.
   <div class="equation" >
    $$\begin{array}{lll}\gamma & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\\ 30.00& =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\end{array} $$
   </div>

   Squaring both sides of the equation and rearranging terms gives

   <div class="equation" >
    $$ 900.0=\frac{1}{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}} $$
   </div>
        so that     
   <div class="equation" >
    $$1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}=\frac{1}{ 900.0} $$
   </div>
        and     
   <div class="equation" >
    $$\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}=1-\frac{1}{ 900.0}= 0.99888\text{...}. $$
   </div>
   Taking the square root, we find

   <div class="equation" >
    $$\frac{v}{c}= 0.99944, $$
   </div>

   which is rearranged to produce a value for the velocity

   <div class="equation" >
    $$v=  0.9994c. $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

First, remember that you should not round off calculations until the final
result is obtained, or you could get erroneous results. This is especially true
for special relativity calculations, where the differences might only be
revealed after several decimal places. The relativistic effect is large here (
$$\text{γ=} 30.00 $$ ), and we see that $$v $$ is approaching (not equaling) the
speed of light. Since the distance as measured by the astronaut is so much
smaller, the astronaut can travel it in much less time in her frame.

</div>

People could be sent very large distances (thousands or even millions of light
years) and age only a few years on the way if they traveled at extremely high
velocities. But, like emigrants of centuries past, they would leave the Earth
they know forever. Even if they returned, thousands to millions of years would
have passed on the Earth, obliterating most of what now exists. There is also a
more serious practical obstacle to traveling at such velocities; immensely
greater energies than classical physics predicts would be needed to achieve such
high velocities. This will be discussed in [Relativistic Energy](../contents/ch28RelativisticEnergy).

Why don’t we notice length contraction in everyday life? The distance to the
grocery shop does not seem to depend on whether we are moving or not. Examining
the equation $$L={L}_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}} $$ , we see that at
low velocities ( $$v \ll c $$ )
the lengths are nearly equal, the classical expectation. But length contraction
is real, if not commonly experienced. For example, a charged particle, like an
electron, traveling at relativistic velocity has electric field lines that are
compressed along the direction of motion as seen by a stationary observer. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).) As the electron passes a detector, such as a coil
of wire, its field interacts much more briefly, an effect observed at particle
accelerators such as the 3 km long Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). In fact,
to an electron traveling down the beam pipe at SLAC, the accelerator and the
Earth are all moving by and are length contracted. The relativistic effect is so
great than the accelerator is only 0.5 m long to the electron. It is actually
easier to get the electron beam down the pipe, since the beam does not have to
be as precisely aimed to get down a short pipe as it would down one 3 km long.
This, again, is an experimental verification of the Special Theory of
Relativity.

### Summary

- All observers agree upon relative speed.
- Distance depends on an observer’s motion. Proper length $${L}_{0} $$ is the
  distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to
  both of the points. Earth-bound observers measure proper length when measuring
  the distance between two points that are stationary relative to the Earth.
- Length contraction $$L $$ is the shortening of the measured length of an
  object moving relative to the observer’s frame:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$L=L_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}=\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\gamma }. $$

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A spaceship, 200 m long as seen on board, moves by the Earth at  $$ 0.970c $$ .
 What is its length as measured by an Earth-bound observer?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The spaceship's rest length (as measured on board) is the proper length $$L_0 = 200$$ m. An Earth-bound observer will measure a contracted length $$L = L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$.

**Solution**

First, calculate $$\gamma$$ for $$v = 0.970c$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.970c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.9409}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0591}} = \frac{1}{0.2431} = 4.114$$
</div>

Now calculate the contracted length:

<div class="equation">
$$L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma} = \frac{200 \text{ m}}{4.114} = 48.6 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Alternatively, using the direct formula:

<div class="equation">
$$L = L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = (200 \text{ m})\sqrt{1-0.9409} = (200 \text{ m})(0.2431) = 48.6 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

At 97% the speed of light, the spaceship appears dramatically compressed to less than one-quarter of its rest length! From the Earth observer's perspective, the 200 m spaceship looks only 48.6 m long—a contraction of over 75%. This extreme length contraction occurs only in the direction of motion; dimensions perpendicular to the motion remain unchanged. From the spaceship's perspective, the situation is reversed: the astronauts see themselves in a normal 200 m ship, but they observe the Earth and everything on it contracted in the direction of motion by the same factor. This symmetry is a fundamental feature of special relativity—neither reference frame is "special." Such dramatic length contractions are observed in particle accelerators, where fast-moving particles effectively see shortened beam pipes and target materials.

How fast would a 6.0 m-long sports car have to be going past you in order for it to appear only 5.5 m long?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The car's rest length is $$L_0 = 6.0$$ m (its proper length), and the contracted length is $$L = 5.5$$ m. Use the length contraction formula $$L = L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$ and solve for $$v$$.

**Solution**

Starting with the length contraction equation:

$$L = L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$5.5 = 6.0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$\frac{5.5}{6.0} = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$0.9167 = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

Squaring both sides:

$$(0.9167)^2 = 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

$$0.8403 = 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.8403 = 0.1597$$

$$v = c\sqrt{0.1597} = 0.400c$$

**Discussion**

The sports car would have to be traveling at 40% the speed of light, or approximately $$1.20 \times 10^8$$ m/s (120,000 km/s), for its length to contract from 6.0 m to 5.5 m. This is an enormous velocity—far beyond anything achievable with current technology. The 0.5 m contraction (about 8.3% of the original length) requires this incredibly high speed, illustrating why we never observe length contraction in everyday life. Even our fastest spacecraft travel at less than 0.01% the speed of light, producing completely negligible length contractions of much less than the width of an atom.

 (b) How far would it have traveled as observed on the Earth? (c) What distance is this in the muon's frame?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The muon's rest lifetime is $$\Delta t_0 = 2.20 \times 10^{-6}$$ s (from Example 1 in the Time Dilation section). For part (a), find the dilated time using $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$. For part (b), calculate the distance traveled on Earth using $$L_0 = v\Delta t$$. For part (c), use the muon's proper time to find the contracted distance in its frame.

**Solution**

(a) First, calculate $$\gamma$$ for $$v = 0.0500c$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.0500c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.00250}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.9975}} = \frac{1}{0.9987} = 1.0013$$

Now find the observed lifetime:

$$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 = (1.0013)(2.20 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}) = 2.203 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$$

(b) Distance traveled as observed on Earth:

$$L_0 = v\Delta t = (0.0500)(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})(2.203 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}) = 33.0 \text{ m}$$

(c) Distance in the muon's frame (using proper time):

$$L = v\Delta t_0 = (0.0500)(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})(2.20 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}) = 33.0 \text{ m}$$

Alternatively, using length contraction:

$$L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma} = \frac{33.0 \text{ m}}{1.0013} = 33.0 \text{ m}$$

**Discussion**

At only 5% the speed of light, relativistic effects are minuscule. The time dilation factor $$\gamma = 1.0013$$ means the muon lives only 0.13% longer than its rest lifetime, and the distances in parts (b) and (c) are essentially identical (both 33.0 m to three significant figures). This demonstrates that at low velocities ($$v \ll c$$), relativistic and classical predictions converge. The muon would travel only 33 meters before decaying—much less than the distance in the high-speed example where $$v = 0.950c$$ and the muon traveled over 2000 meters due to significant time dilation.

(a) How fast would an athlete need to be running for a 100-m race to look 100 yd long? (b) Is the answer consistent with the fact that relativistic effects are difficult to observe in ordinary circumstances? Explain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First convert 100 yd to meters: $$100 \text{ yd} = 100 \times 0.9144 \text{ m} = 91.44$$ m. The proper length is $$L_0 = 100$$ m, and the contracted length is $$L = 91.44$$ m. Use $$L = L_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$ to find the required velocity.

**Solution**

(a) Using the length contraction formula:

$$91.44 = 100\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$\frac{91.44}{100} = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$0.9144 = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

Squaring both sides:

$$(0.9144)^2 = 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

$$0.8361 = 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.8361 = 0.1639$$

$$v = c\sqrt{0.1639} = 0.405c$$

$$v = (0.405)(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) = 1.21 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$

(b) **Yes, this is entirely consistent** with the fact that relativistic effects are difficult to observe in ordinary circumstances. The athlete would need to run at 40.5% the speed of light—over 121 million meters per second! For comparison, the world record 100-m sprint is run at about 10 m/s, which is $$3.3 \times 10^{-8}c$$. At this actual speed, the relativistic contraction would be utterly negligible—far less than the size of an atomic nucleus. Even if the athlete could somehow run at 1000 m/s (faster than a rifle bullet), the velocity would still be only $$3.3 \times 10^{-6}c$$, producing immeasurably small relativistic effects.

**Discussion**

This problem beautifully illustrates why special relativity seemed counterintuitive when first proposed. The speed required for even modest length contractions (8.56% in this case) is so enormous that no human experience prior to particle physics could have revealed these effects. It's only in the realm of particle accelerators and cosmic rays, where particles routinely travel at significant fractions of $$c$$, that length contraction becomes observable and must be accounted for in experimental design and data analysis.

**Unreasonable Results**

(a) Find the value of $$\gamma $$ for the following situation. An astronaut
measures the length of her spaceship to be 25.0 m, while an Earth-bound observer
measures it to be 100 m. (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which
assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
(a) 0.250

(b) $$\gamma $$ must be ≥1

(c) The Earth-bound observer must measure a shorter length, so it is
unreasonable to assume a longer length.

**Unreasonable Results**

A spaceship is heading directly toward the Earth at a velocity of $$ 0.800c $$ .
The astronaut on board claims that he can send a canister toward the Earth at $$ 1.20c $$ relative to the Earth. (a) Calculate the velocity the canister must
have relative to the spaceship. (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c)
Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the relativistic velocity addition formula: $$u = \frac{v + u'}{1 + \frac{vu'}{c^2}}$$, where $$v = 0.800c$$ is the spaceship's velocity relative to Earth, $$u = 1.20c$$ is the desired canister velocity relative to Earth, and $$u'$$ is the canister velocity relative to the spaceship. Solve for $$u'$$.

**Solution**

(a) Rearranging the relativistic velocity addition formula to solve for $$u'$$:

$$u = \frac{v + u'}{1 + \frac{vu'}{c^2}}$$

$$u\left(1 + \frac{vu'}{c^2}\right) = v + u'$$

$$u + \frac{uvu'}{c^2} = v + u'$$

$$u - v = u' - \frac{uvu'}{c^2}$$

$$u - v = u'\left(1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}\right)$$

$$u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}$$

Substituting values:

$$u' = \frac{1.20c - 0.800c}{1 - \frac{(1.20c)(0.800c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.400c}{1 - \frac{0.960c^2}{c^2}} = \frac{0.400c}{1 - 0.960} = \frac{0.400c}{0.040} = 10.0c$$

(b) This result is unreasonable because **no object with mass can travel at or exceed the speed of light**. The canister would need to travel at 10 times the speed of light relative to the spaceship, which violates the fundamental postulate of special relativity that nothing with mass can reach or exceed $$c$$ in any reference frame.

(c) The unreasonable assumption is that the canister can reach a velocity of $$1.20c$$ relative to the Earth. According to special relativity, no matter how fast the canister is shot from the spaceship, its velocity relative to Earth must be less than $$c$$. Even if the canister could somehow travel at $$c$$ relative to the spaceship (which is impossible for massive objects), the relativistic velocity addition formula would give:

$$u = \frac{0.800c + c}{1 + \frac{(0.800c)(c)}{c^2}} = \frac{1.800c}{1 + 0.800} = \frac{1.800c}{1.800} = c$$

So the maximum possible velocity relative to Earth is $$c$$, not $$1.20c$$.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the fundamental difference between classical and relativistic velocity addition. Classically, we might add $$0.800c + 0.400c = 1.20c$$ without concern, but special relativity forbids velocities exceeding $$c$$. The relativistic velocity addition formula ensures that no combination of subluminal velocities can produce a velocity ≥ $$c$$ in any reference frame, protecting the speed of light as the ultimate speed limit. This "unreasonable results" problem helps students recognize when their assumptions violate relativistic principles.

proper length
: $${L}_{0} $$ ; the distance between two points measured by an observer who is
at rest relative to both of the points; Earth-bound observers measure proper
length when measuring the distance between two points that are stationary
relative to the Earth

length contraction
: $$L $$ , the shortening of the measured length of an object moving relative
to the observer’s frame:
$$L=L_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}=\frac{ {L}_{0}}{\gamma } $$
