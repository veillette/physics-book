* Explain reflection of light from polished and rough surfaces.
</div>

Whenever we look into a mirror, or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we
are seeing a reflection. When you look at this page, too, you are seeing light
reflected from it. Large telescopes use reflection to form an image of stars and
other astronomical objects.

The law of reflection is illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), which also shows
how the angles are measured relative to the perpendicular to the surface at the
point where the light ray strikes. We expect to see reflections from smooth
surfaces, but [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) illustrates how a rough surface reflects
light. Since the light strikes different parts of the surface at different
angles, it is reflected in many different directions, or diffused. Diffused
light is what allows us to see a sheet of paper from any angle, as illustrated
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and
walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from all sides. A mirror, on the
other hand, has a smooth surface (compared with the wavelength of light) and
reflects light at specific angles, as illustrated in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).
When the moon reflects from a lake, as shown in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), a
combination of these effects takes place.

![A light ray is incident on a smooth surface and is falling obliquely, making an angle theta i relative to a perpendicular line drawn to the surface at the point where the incident ray strikes. The light ray gets reflected making an angle theta r with the same perpendicular drawn to the surface.](../resources/Figure_25_02_01.jpg 'The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence— ( \\theta_r = \\theta_i ).

of incidence.

The Law of Reflection
</div>
The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

</div>

When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind
the mirror. This is illustrated in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6). We see the light
coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such
that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror as we stand away
from the mirror. If the mirror is on the wall of a room, the images in it are
all behind the mirror, which can make the room seem bigger. Although these
mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (like behind a
solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can
be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do with our
eyes (optical instruments themselves). The precise manner in which images are
formed by mirrors and lenses will be treated in later sections of this chapter.

![A girl stands in front of a mirror and looks into the mirror for her image. The light rays from her feet and head fall on the mirror and get reflected following the law of reflection: the angle of incidence theta is equal to the angle of reflection theta.](../resources/Figure_25_02_06.jpg 'Our image in a mirror is behind the mirror. The two rays shown are those that strike the mirror at just the correct angles to be reflected into the eyes of the person. The image appears to be in the direction the rays are coming from when they enter the eyes.')

Take-Home Experiment: Law of Reflection
</div>
Take a piece of paper and shine a flashlight at an angle at the paper, as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Now shine the flashlight at a mirror at an angle. Do your observations confirm the predictions in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) and [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)? Shine the flashlight on various surfaces and determine whether the reflected light is diffuse or not. You can choose a shiny metallic lid of a pot or your skin. Using the mirror and flashlight, can you confirm the law of reflection? You will need to draw lines on a piece of paper showing the incident and reflected rays. (This part works even better if you use a laser pencil.)

Show that when light reflects from two mirrors that meet each other at a right angle, the outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray, as illustrated in the following figure.

![Two mirrors meet each other at a right angle. An incoming ray of light is reflected by one mirror and then the other, such that the outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray.](../resources/Figure_25_02_07.jpg 'A corner reflector sends the reflected ray back in a direction parallel to the incident ray, independent of incoming direction.')

**Strategy**

We need to apply the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) to both mirror surfaces and show that the outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray using geometric relationships.

**Solution**

Consider an incoming ray that strikes the first mirror at an angle $$\theta_1$$ with respect to the normal to that mirror surface. By the law of reflection, it reflects at the same angle $$\theta_1$$ on the other side of the normal.

Since the two mirrors meet at a right angle (90°), the normals to the two mirror surfaces are also perpendicular to each other.

After reflection from the first mirror, the ray travels toward the second mirror. The key geometric insight is that the angle the reflected ray from the first mirror makes with the second mirror's surface can be analyzed using the fact that the mirrors are perpendicular.

Let's use a coordinate system where one mirror is vertical and the other is horizontal. If the incoming ray makes an angle $$\alpha$$ with the horizontal mirror:
- The angle of incidence on the horizontal mirror is $$\alpha$$
- By the law of reflection, it reflects at angle $$\alpha$$ above the normal
- This reflected ray then strikes the vertical mirror at angle $$(90° - \alpha)$$ with respect to the normal of the vertical mirror
- After reflecting from the vertical mirror, the angle of reflection is also $$(90° - \alpha)$$

By geometry, when we trace the path of the ray through both reflections, the final outgoing direction makes the same angle with the horizontal as the incoming ray, but travels in the opposite direction. This means the outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray.

More generally, for any incident angle, the sum of the direction changes at both reflections equals 180°, resulting in a ray that is parallel to (but oppositely directed from) the incident ray.

**Discussion**

This property of perpendicular mirrors is the basis for corner reflectors, which are used in applications like bicycle reflectors, road signs, and even the reflector left on the Moon by astronauts. The incoming and outgoing rays being parallel means that light is reflected back toward its source, regardless of the angle of incidence. This makes corner reflectors extremely effective for safety applications and precise distance measurements.

The result is independent of the incident angle, which is why corner reflectors work effectively even when not perfectly aligned with the light source.

Light shows staged with lasers use moving mirrors to swing beams and create colorful effects. Show that a light ray reflected from a mirror changes direction by  $$2\theta  $$
 when the mirror is rotated by an angle  $$\theta  $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We apply the law of reflection before and after the mirror is rotated. By comparing the direction of the reflected ray in both cases, we can determine how much the reflected ray's direction changes when the mirror rotates by angle $$\theta$$.

**Solution**

Consider a ray incident on a mirror at some initial angle. Let's denote the angle of incidence as $$\alpha$$ with respect to the normal to the mirror surface.

Initial situation:
- Angle of incidence: $$\alpha$$
- Angle of reflection: $$\alpha$$ (by the law of reflection)
- The incident and reflected rays make an angle of $$2\alpha$$ with each other

After rotating the mirror by angle $$\theta$$:
- The normal to the mirror surface also rotates by $$\theta$$
- The new angle of incidence becomes: $$\alpha + \theta$$
- The new angle of reflection is: $$\alpha + \theta$$

The change in the direction of the reflected ray:
The original reflected ray made an angle $$\alpha$$ with the original normal. The new reflected ray makes an angle $$\alpha + \theta$$ with the new normal, which itself has rotated by $$\theta$$.

Relative to a fixed reference direction, the original reflected ray was at angle $$\alpha$$ from the original normal. The new reflected ray is at angle $$(\alpha + \theta)$$ from the new normal, which is at angle $$\theta$$ from the original normal.

Therefore, the total change in the reflected ray's direction is:
$$\Delta = \theta + (\alpha + \theta) - \alpha = 2\theta$$

**Discussion**

This result shows that rotating a mirror by angle $$\theta$$ causes the reflected beam to rotate by $$2\theta$$. This principle is exploited in laser light shows where mirrors mounted on galvanometers (devices that can rotate precisely based on electrical signals) are used to rapidly sweep laser beams across a screen or through space. By rotating the mirror through a small angle, the laser beam moves through twice that angle, providing amplified motion.

This 2:1 relationship between mirror rotation and beam deflection is also used in optical scanners, laser printers, and many other optical instruments where precise beam steering is required. It's an important consideration when designing such systems, as it means small vibrations or imperfections in mirror positioning are magnified in the output beam.

A flat mirror is neither converging nor diverging. To prove this, consider two rays originating from the same point and diverging at an angle  $$\theta  $$ .
 Show that after striking a plane mirror, the angle between their directions remains  $$\theta  $$.

![Light rays diverging from a point at an angle theta fall on a mirror at two different places and their reflected rays diverge. When the reflected rays are extended backwards from their points of reflection, they meet at a point behind the mirror, where they diverge from each other at the same angle theta.](../resources/Figure_25_02_08.jpg 'A flat mirror neither converges nor diverges light rays. Two rays continue to diverge at the same angle after reflection.')
{: #Figure8}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We consider two rays emanating from a common point and striking a flat mirror at different locations. By applying the law of reflection to each ray and using geometric principles, we show that the angle between the reflected rays equals the angle between the incident rays.

**Solution**

Let two rays originate from a common point S and strike a flat mirror at points A and B. Let the angle between these two incident rays be $$\theta$$.

For ray 1 (striking at point A):
- Let the angle of incidence be $$\alpha_1$$ (measured from the normal)
- By the law of reflection, the angle of reflection is also $$\alpha_1$$

For ray 2 (striking at point B):
- Let the angle of incidence be $$\alpha_2$$ (measured from the normal)
- By the law of reflection, the angle of reflection is also $$\alpha_2$$

Since the mirror is flat (plane), the normal at every point on the mirror is parallel to the normal at every other point. This means both normals are parallel.

The angle between the two incident rays is:
$$\theta = |\alpha_1 - \alpha_2|$$

For the reflected rays, using the law of reflection and the fact that the normals are parallel:
- Ray 1 reflects at angle $$\alpha_1$$ on the opposite side of the normal
- Ray 2 reflects at angle $$\alpha_2$$ on the opposite side of the normal

By geometric construction, since both rays reflect according to the same law and the normals are parallel, the angle between the reflected rays is also:
$$\theta' = |\alpha_1 - \alpha_2| = \theta$$

This can be verified by noting that the reflected rays, when extended backward, appear to originate from a virtual image point that is the same distance behind the mirror as the object point is in front of it. The geometry ensures that the angle between the rays remains unchanged.

**Discussion**

This result confirms that a flat (plane) mirror neither converges nor diverges light rays—it preserves the angle between rays. This is fundamentally different from curved mirrors:

- A concave (converging) mirror would cause the angle between the reflected rays to be smaller than $$\theta$$, bringing the rays closer together
- A convex (diverging) mirror would cause the angle between the reflected rays to be larger than $$\theta$$, spreading the rays farther apart

The fact that a plane mirror preserves angles means that the image formed is the same size as the object and appears to be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. This property makes flat mirrors ideal for applications where undistorted images are needed, such as bathroom mirrors, dressing mirrors, and periscopes.
