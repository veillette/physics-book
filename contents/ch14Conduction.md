![The figure shows an insulated wooden partition in a house. The partition is insulated because it encapsulates a cloth-type material.](../resources/Figure_14_05_01.jpg 'Insulation is used to limit the conduction of heat from the inside to the outside (in winters) and from the outside to the inside (in summers).

Your feet feel cold as you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in your
cold house and then step onto the kitchen tile floor. This result is intriguing,
since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The different
sensation you feel is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: the
heat loss during the same time interval is greater for skin in contact with the
tiles than with the carpet, so the temperature drop is greater on the tiles.

Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, good
conductors of electricity (metals like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are
also good heat conductors, whereas insulators of electricity (wood, plastic, and
rubber) are poor heat conductors. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows molecules in two
bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a molecule in
the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two molecules collide, an
energy transfer from the molecule with greater kinetic energy to the molecule
with less kinetic energy occurs. The cumulative effect from all collisions
results in a net flux of heat from the hot body to the colder body. The heat
flux thus depends on the temperature difference $$\Delta Τ={Τ}_{\text{hot}}-{T}_
{\text{cold}} $$ . Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water
than from hot tap water. Conversely, if the temperatures are the same, the net
heat transfer rate falls to zero, and equilibrium is achieved. Owing to the fact
that the number of collisions increases with increasing area, heat conduction
depends on the cross-sectional area. If you touch a cold wall with your palm,
your hand cools faster than if you just touch it with your fingertip.

![The figure shows a vertical line labeled “surface” that divides the figure in two. Just below the line is a horizontal rightward wavy arrow labeled Q, heat conduction. The area left of the surface line is labeled higher temperature and the area right of the surface line is labeled lower temperature. One spherical object, labeled “high energy before collision” is on the left bottom side, with an arrow from it pointing to the right and up toward the vertical midpoint of the surface line. There is another spherical object at the top left side close to the surface line with an arrow from it pointing to the left and up. A third spherical object labeled “low energy before collision” appears on the right top side with an arrow pointing from it to the left and down toward the vertical midpoint of the surface line. There is a final spherical object at the lower right side close to the surface line with an arrow pointing from it to the right and down. There are dotted lines coming from all the four particles, merging at the midpoint on the surface line.](../resources/Figure_14_05_02.jpg 'The molecules in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a molecule in the lower temperature region (right side) has low energy before collision, but its energy increases after colliding with the contact surface. In contrast, a molecule in the higher temperature region (left side) has high energy before collision, but its energy decreases after colliding with the contact surface.')

A third factor in the mechanism of conduction is the thickness of the material
through which heat transfers. The figure below shows a slab of material with
different temperatures on either side. Suppose that $${T}_{2} $$ is greater than
$${T}\_{1} $$ , so that heat is transferred from left to right. Heat transfer
from the left side to the right side is accomplished by a series of molecular
collisions. The thicker the material, the more time it takes to transfer the
same amount of heat. This model explains why thick clothing is warmer than thin
clothing in winters, and why Arctic mammals protect themselves with thick
blubber.

![Two rectangular blocks are shown with the right one labeled T one and the left one labeled T two. The blocks are placed on a surface at a distance d from each other, so that their largest face faces the opposite block. The block T one is cold and the block T two is hot. The blocks are connected to each other with a conducting rectangular block of thermal conductivity k and cross-sectional area A. A wavy line labeled Q is inside the conducting block and points from the hot block to the cold block.](../resources/Figure_14_05_03.jpg 'Heat conduction occurs through any material, represented here by a rectangular bar, whether window glass or walrus blubber. The temperature of the material is ( T_{2} ) on the left and ( T_{1} ) on the right, where ( T_{2} ) is greater than ( T_{1} ) . The rate of heat transfer by conduction is directly proportional to the surface area ( A ) , the temperature difference ( T_2-T_1 ), and the substance’s conductivity ( k ) . The rate of heat transfer is inversely proportional to the thickness ( d ) . ')
{: #Figure3}

Lastly, the heat transfer rate depends on the material properties described by
the coefficient of thermal conductivity. All four factors are included in a
simple equation that was deduced from and is confirmed by experiments. The **rate of conductive heat transfer** through a slab of material, such as the one
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{k_{B}A\left({T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)}{d}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$Q/t $$ is the rate of heat transfer in watts or kilocalories per second,
$$k $$ is the **thermal conductivity** of the material, $$A $$ and $$d $$ are
its surface area and thickness, as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), and $$\left(
{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right) $$ is the temperature difference across the
slab. [[Table 1]](#Table1) gives representative values of thermal conductivity.

Calculating Heat Transfer Through Conduction: Conduction Rate Through an Ice Box
</div>
A Styrofoam ice box has a total area of  $$0.950 {\text{m}}^{2} $$
 and walls with an average thickness of 2.50 cm. The box contains ice, water, and canned beverages at  $$0 \text{ºC} $$ .
 The inside of the box is kept cold by melting ice. How much ice melts in one day if the ice box is kept in the trunk of a car at  $$35.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy**

This question involves both heat for a phase change (melting of ice) and the
transfer of heat by conduction. To find the amount of ice melted, we must find
the net heat transferred. This value can be obtained by calculating the rate of
heat transfer by conduction and multiplying by time.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns.
<div class="equation">
$$A= 0.950{\text{m}}^{2}\mathrm{; }d= 2.50\text{cm}=0.0250\text{ m;} {T}_{1}=0º\text{C;} {T}_{2}=  35.0º\text{C} \text{,}  t=1 \text{day}=24 \text{ hours}=86 400 \text{s} \text{.}  $$
</div>

2. Identify the unknowns. We need to solve for the mass of the ice, $$m $$ . We
   will also need to solve for the net heat transferred to melt the ice, $$Q $$
   .

3. Determine which equations to use. The rate of heat transfer by conduction is
   given by
   <div class="equation">
   $$\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{k_{B}A\left({T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)}{d}\text{.} $$
   </div>

4. The heat is used to melt the ice:
   $$Q=m L_{\text{f}}. $$
5. Insert the known values:
   <div class="equation">
   $$\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{\left(0.010 \text{J/s}\cdot \text{m}\cdot \text{ºC}\right)\left(0.950 {\text{m}}^{2}\right)\left(35.0\text{ºC}-0\text{ºC}\right)}{0.0250 \text{m}}=13.3 \text{J/s} \text{.}  $$
   </div>

6. Multiply the rate of heat transfer by the time (
   $$1\text{day} =86 400\text{s} $$ ) :
   <div class="equation" >
   $$Q=\left(Q/t\right)t=\left( 13.3\text{J/s}\right)\left(86 400\text{s}\right)= 1.15 \times 10^{6} \text{J} \text{.}  $$
   </div>

7. Set this equal to the heat transferred to melt the ice:
   $$Q=m L_{\text{f}} $$ . Solve for the mass $$m $$ \:
   <div class="equation">
   $$m=\frac{Q}{ {L}_{\text{f}}}=\frac{ 1.15 \times 10^{6} \text{J}}{334  \times 10^{3} \text{J/kg}}= 3.44\text{kg} \text{.}  $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

The result of 3.44 kg, or about 7.6 lbs, seems about right, based on experience.
You might expect to use about a 4 kg (7–10 lb) bag of ice per day. A little
extra ice is required if you add any warm food or beverages.

Inspecting the conductivities in [[Table 1]](#Table1) shows that Styrofoam is a
very poor conductor and thus a good insulator. Other good insulators include
fiberglass, wool, and goose-down feathers. Like Styrofoam, these all incorporate
many small pockets of air, taking advantage of air’s poor thermal conductivity.

A combination of material and thickness is often manipulated to develop good
insulators—the smaller the conductivity $$k $$ and the larger the thickness $$d
$$ , the better. The ratio of $$d/k $$ will thus be large for a good insulator.
The ratio $$d/k $$ is called the ** $$R $$ factor**{: class="term"}. The rate of
conductive heat transfer is inversely proportional to $$R $$ . The larger the
value of $$R $$ , the better the insulation. $$R $$ factors are most commonly
quoted for household insulation, refrigerators, and the like—unfortunately, it
is still in non-metric units of ft<sup>2</sup>·ºF·h/Btu, although the unit
usually goes unstated (1 British thermal unit \[Btu\] is the amount of energy
needed to change the temperature of 1.0 lb of water by 1.0 ºF). A couple of
representative values are an $$R $$ factor of 11 for 3.5-in-thick fiberglass
batts (pieces) of insulation and an $$R $$ factor of 19 for 6.5-in-thick
fiberglass batts. Walls are usually insulated with 3.5-in batts, while ceilings
are usually insulated with 6.5-in batts. In cold climates, thicker batts may be
used in ceilings and walls.

![The figure shows two thick rectangular pieces of fiberglass batt lying one upon the other.](../resources/Figure_14_05_04.jpg 'The fiberglass batt is used for insulation of walls and ceilings to prevent heat transfer between the inside of the building and the outside environment.')
{: #Figure4}

Note that in [[Table 1]](#Table1), the best thermal conductors—silver, copper,
gold, and aluminum—are also the best electrical conductors, again related to the
density of free electrons in them. Cooking utensils are typically made from good
conductors.

Calculating the Temperature Difference Maintained by a Heat Transfer: Conduction Through an Aluminum Pan
</div>
Water is boiling in an aluminum pan placed on an electrical element on a stovetop. The sauce pan has a bottom that is 0.800 cm thick and 14.0 cm in diameter. The boiling water is evaporating at the rate of 1.00 g/s. What is the temperature difference across (through) the bottom of the pan?

**Strategy**

Conduction through the aluminum is the primary method of heat transfer here, and
so we use the equation for the rate of heat transfer and solve for the
temperature difference.

<div class="equation">
 $${T}_{2}-{T}_{1}=\frac{Q}{t}\left(\frac{d}{k_{B}A}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>
**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the SI units. The thickness of the
   pan, $$d=0.800\text{cm}= 8.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{m} \text{,} $$

   the area of the pan, $$A=\pi {\left(0.14/2 \right)}^{2} {\text{m}}^{2}= 1.54
   \times 10^{-2} {\text{m}}^{2} $$ , and the thermal conductivity, $$k=220
   \text{J/s}\cdot \text{m}\cdot ºC. $$

2. Calculate the necessary heat of vaporization of 1 g of water:
   <div class="equation">
   $$Q=m L_{\text{v}}=\left( 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{kg}\right)\left(2256
   \times 10^{3} \text{J/kg}\right)=2256\mathrm{ J.} $$
   </div>

3. Calculate the rate of heat transfer given that 1 g of water melts in one
   second:
   <div class="equation">
   $$Q/t=2256\text{J/s or 2.26 kW.} $$
   </div>

4. Insert the knowns into the equation and solve for the temperature difference:
   <div class="equation">
   $${T}_{2}-{T}_{1}=\frac{Q}{t}\left(\frac{d}{k_{B}A}\right)=\left(
   2256\text{J/s}\right)\frac{ 8.00 × 10^{-3}\text{m}}{\left(220\text{J/s}\cdot
   \text{m}\cdot \text{ºC}\right)\left( 1.54 \times 10^{-2}
   {\text{m}}^{2}\right)}= 5.33º\mathrm{C.} $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

The value for the heat transfer $$Q/t =2.26\text{kW}\text{or }2256\text{J/s} $$
is typical for an electric stove. This value gives a remarkably small
temperature difference between the stove and the pan. Consider that the stove
burner is red-hot while the inside of the pan is nearly $$100 \text{ºC} $$
because of its contact with boiling water. This contact effectively cools the
bottom of the pan in spite of its proximity to the very hot stove burner.
Aluminum is such a good conductor that it only takes this small temperature
difference to produce a heat transfer of 2.26 kW into the pan.

Conduction is caused by the random motion of atoms and molecules. As such, it is
an ineffective mechanism for heat transport over macroscopic distances and short
time distances. Take, for example, the temperature on the Earth, which would be
unbearably cold during the night and extremely hot during the day if heat
transport in the atmosphere was to be only through conduction. In another
example, car engines would overheat unless there was a more efficient way to
remove excess heat from the pistons.

Check Your Understanding

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
How does the rate of heat transfer by conduction change when all spatial dimensions are doubled?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
Because area is the product of two spatial dimensions, it increases by a factor of four when each dimension is doubled  $$\left({A}_{\text{final}}=\left(2d{\right)}^{2}=4{d}^{2}=4{A}_{\text{initial}}\right) $$ .
 The distance, however, simply doubles. Because the temperature difference and the coefficient of thermal conductivity are independent of the spatial dimensions, the rate of heat transfer by conduction increases by a factor of four divided by two, or two:

<div class="equation">
 $${\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)}_{\text{final}}=\frac{ k_{B}A_{\text{final}}\left({T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)}{ {d}_{\text{final}}}=\frac{k\left({4 \text{A}}_{\text{initial}}\right)\left({T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)}{ {2d}_{\text{initial}}}=2\frac{ k_{B}A_{\text{initial}}\left({T}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)}{ {d}_{\text{initial}}}=2{\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)}_{\text{initial}}\text{.} $$

- Heat conduction is the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact
  with each other.
- The rate of heat transfer $$Q/t $$
  (energy per unit time) is proportional to the temperature difference $${T}_
  {2}-{T}_{1} $$ and the contact area $$A $$ and inversely proportional to the
  distance $$d $$ between the objects:

**Strategy**

We use the equation for heat conduction: $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA(T_2 - T_1)}{d}$$, where $$k$$ is the thermal conductivity of glass (from Table 1).

**Solution**

Given:
- Area: $$A = 3.00 \text{ m}^2$$
- Thickness: $$d = 0.635 \text{ cm} = 0.00635 \text{ m}$$
- Inner temperature: $$T_1 = 5.00\text{ºC}$$
- Outer temperature: $$T_2 = -10.0\text{ºC}$$
- Thermal conductivity of glass: $$k = 0.84 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

Temperature difference:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = T_1 - T_2 = 5.00 - (-10.0) = 15.0\text{ºC}$$

Rate of heat conduction:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d} = \frac{(0.84)(3.00)(15.0)}{0.00635}$$

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{37.8}{0.00635} = 5950 \text{ W} = 5.95 \text{ kW}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The heat loss rate of 5.95 kW is enormous—equivalent to running almost six 1000-watt space heaters continuously! This explains why single-pane windows are such poor insulators and why the air near windows feels cold on winter days. The high heat loss rate also explains why frost and condensation readily form on the inner surface: the window surface temperature drops rapidly as heat flows outward.

This dramatic heat loss is why:
1. Modern buildings use double or triple-pane windows with air or gas-filled gaps
2. Window treatments (curtains, blinds) significantly reduce heat loss
3. Windows represent major sources of energy loss in homes
4. Storm windows that create an air gap can reduce heat loss by 50% or more

The problem notes correctly that this rate won't be maintained because the inner surface temperature will decrease, reducing the temperature difference. Additionally, room air circulation becomes important: without airflow, a cold layer forms next to the window, somewhat insulating it.

**Answer**

The rate of heat conduction through the window is **5.95 kW** or approximately **6000 W**.

Given:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{0.84}{0.0100} = 84.0 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The heat conduction rate of 84.0 W represents the power that must be dissipated from the body's surface to maintain thermal equilibrium. For a resting person, the basal metabolic rate is typically around 80-100 W, so this conduction rate is perfectly consistent with maintaining body temperature.

This calculation assumes:
1. Average tissue properties (actual human tissue varies in composition)
2. Steady-state conditions (constant temperatures)
3. One-dimensional heat flow perpendicular to skin
4. No blood flow effects (which significantly enhance heat transfer in reality)

In practice, the body uses multiple mechanisms to transfer this heat to the environment:
- **Conduction** through tissues (84 W calculated here)
- **Convection** from skin surface to surrounding air
- **Radiation** from skin to cooler surroundings
- **Evaporation** of perspiration when needed

The 3°C temperature difference between core and skin is typical for resting conditions in a comfortable environment. During:
- **Exercise**: Core temperature can rise to 39-40°C, increasing the temperature gradient and heat flow
- **Cold exposure**: Skin temperature drops, increasing the gradient but requiring more metabolic heat production
- **Fever**: Core temperature rises, requiring enhanced cooling mechanisms

Blood circulation is crucial—it carries heat from deep organs to the skin surface much more efficiently than conduction alone. That's why blood flow to the skin increases during exercise or hot weather (causing flushing) and decreases in cold weather (causing pale, cool skin).

**Answer**

The rate of heat conduction out of the human body is **84.0 W**.

Suppose you stand with one foot on ceramic flooring and one foot on a wool carpet, making contact over an area of  $$ 80.0 {\text{cm}}^{2} $$

 on their bottom sides. At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the ceramic and carpet at  $$ 33.0\text{ºC} $$ ? For ceramic, use the thermal conductivity for glass.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the heat conduction equation $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA(T_2 - T_1)}{d}$$ separately for ceramic (using glass conductivity) and wool carpet. The dramatic difference in thermal conductivities will explain why the ceramic feels colder.

**Solution**

Given for both materials:
- Contact area: $$A = 80.0 \text{ cm}^2 = 80.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 0.00800 \text{ m}^2$$
- Thickness: $$d = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$
- Top temperature: $$T_1 = 33.0\text{ºC}$$
- Bottom temperature: $$T_2 = 10.0\text{ºC}$$
- Temperature difference: $$\Delta T = 33.0 - 10.0 = 23.0\text{ºC}$$

From Table 1:
- Thermal conductivity of glass (ceramic): $$k_{ceramic} = 0.84 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Thermal conductivity of wool: $$k_{wool} = 0.04 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

**For ceramic floor:**
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t}_{ceramic} = \frac{k_{ceramic}A\Delta T}{d} = \frac{(0.84)(0.00800)(23.0)}{0.0200}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t}_{ceramic} = \frac{0.155}{0.0200} = 7.73 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**For wool carpet:**
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t}_{wool} = \frac{k_{wool}A\Delta T}{d} = \frac{(0.04)(0.00800)(23.0)}{0.0200}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t}_{wool} = \frac{0.00736}{0.0200} = 0.368 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**Ratio:**
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q_{ceramic}/t}{Q_{wool}/t} = \frac{7.73}{0.368} = 21.0$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ceramic floor conducts heat away from your foot **21 times faster** than the wool carpet! This explains the common experience that tile or ceramic floors feel much colder than carpeted floors, even when both are at the same temperature. Your foot on the ceramic loses 7.73 W compared to only 0.368 W on the carpet.

The sensation of "coldness" is actually the sensation of rapid heat loss from your skin. Good conductors like ceramic, metal, and stone feel cold because they efficiently conduct heat away from your body. Good insulators like wool, wood, and cork feel warm because they conduct heat poorly, allowing your skin to maintain its temperature.

This is why:
- Tile bathrooms feel cold in winter
- Wooden floors are preferred barefoot
- Rugs and carpets make rooms feel warmer
- Metal feels colder than wood at the same temperature

The human body continuously produces heat (~100 W at rest), so we can easily sustain these heat loss rates. However, standing barefoot on very cold ceramic for extended periods would eventually cool the feet uncomfortably as the heat loss exceeds local blood flow's ability to replace it.

**Answer**

Heat must transfer from the foot at:
- Ceramic floor: **7.73 W**
- Wool carpet: **0.368 W**

The ceramic floor conducts heat **21 times faster** than the carpet.

A man consumes 3000 kcal of food in one day, converting most of it to maintain body temperature. If he loses half this energy by evaporating water (through breathing and sweating), how many kilograms of water evaporate?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Half of the food energy (3000 kcal) is lost through water evaporation. We use $$Q = mL_v$$ to find the mass of water that evaporates, where $$L_v$$ is the latent heat of vaporization at body temperature.

**Solution**

Given:
- Total food energy: $$E_{food} = 3000 \text{ kcal}$$
- Energy lost by evaporation: $$Q = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 \text{ kcal}$$
- Latent heat of vaporization at body temperature (37°C): $$L_v = 580 \text{ kcal/kg}$$ (from Ch 14, Section 3 footnote)

Convert to consistent units (already in kcal).

Using $$Q = mL_v$$, solve for mass:
<div class="equation">
$$m = \frac{Q}{L_v} = \frac{1500 \text{ kcal}}{580 \text{ kcal/kg}} = 2.59 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The result of 2.59 kg (approximately 2.6 liters) of water evaporated per day is quite reasonable for a moderately active person. This water loss occurs through:

1. **Perspiration (sweating)**: ~1.0-1.5 kg/day at rest, more during activity
2. **Respiratory evaporation**: ~0.4-0.5 kg/day from exhaled moisture
3. **Insensible perspiration**: ~0.6-0.8 kg/day through skin (not visible sweat)

Total: ~2.0-2.8 kg/day, which matches our calculation.

This illustrates why:
- **Hydration is crucial**: You must replace this 2.6 L of water daily through drinking fluids and eating food (which contains water)
- **Evaporative cooling is efficient**: Half of your metabolic heat is removed by evaporating just 2.6 kg of water, thanks to water's very high latent heat of vaporization (580 kcal/kg at body temperature)
- **Dehydration is dangerous**: Losing just 2-3% of body water (1.5-2 kg for a 70-kg person) impairs performance and thermoregulation

For comparison:
- **Sedentary person in cool climate**: ~1.5-2.0 L/day
- **Moderate activity or warm climate**: ~2.5-3.0 L/day
- **Athlete in hot conditions**: 5-10 L/day or more

During intense exercise in heat, sweat rates can exceed 2-3 L per hour, which is why athletes must drink frequently to avoid dangerous dehydration.

The other half of the food energy (1500 kcal) is dissipated through radiation, convection, and conduction from the body surface, and in warming exhaled air and waste products.

**Answer**

Approximately **2.59 kg** (or **2.6 liters**) of water evaporates per day.

(a) A firewalker runs across a bed of hot coals without sustaining burns. Calculate the heat transferred by conduction into the sole of one foot of a firewalker given that the bottom of the foot is a 3.00-mm-thick callus with a conductivity at the low end of the range for wood and its density is  $$300{\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ .
 The area of contact is  $$ 25.0{\text{cm}}^{2} $$ ,
 the temperature of the coals is  $$700\text{ºC} $$ ,
 and the time in contact is 1.00 s.

(b) What temperature increase is produced in the $$ 25.0{\text{cm}}^{3} $$ of
tissue affected?

(c) What effect do you think this will have on the tissue, keeping in mind that
a callus is made of dead cells?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the heat conduction equation $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d}$$ to find the rate of heat transfer, then multiply by the contact time to get total heat transferred. For part (b), we use $$Q = mc\Delta T$$ to find the temperature increase, where the mass is calculated from volume and density. Part (c) requires analysis of the biological implications.

**Solution**

Given:
- Callus thickness: $$d = 3.00 \text{ mm} = 0.00300 \text{ m}$$
- Contact area: $$A = 25.0 \text{ cm}^2 = 25.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2 = 0.00250 \text{ m}^2$$
- Coal temperature: $$T_{coal} = 700\text{ºC}$$
- Foot temperature (assumed): $$T_{foot} = 37\text{ºC}$$
- Contact time: $$t = 1.00 \text{ s}$$
- Thermal conductivity (low end for wood): $$k = 0.08 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$
- Density: $$\rho = 300 \text{ kg/m}^3$$
- Volume of tissue: $$V = 25.0 \text{ cm}^3 = 25.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3$$
- Specific heat (assume similar to human tissue): $$c = 3500 \text{ J/kg}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

**(a)** Heat transferred by conduction:

Temperature difference:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = 700 - 37 = 663\text{ºC}$$
</div>

Rate of heat conduction:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d} = \frac{(0.08)(0.00250)(663)}{0.00300}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{1.326}{0.00300} = 442 \text{ W}$$
</div>

Total heat transferred in 1.00 s:
<div class="equation">
$$Q = (442 \text{ W})(1.00 \text{ s}) = 442 \text{ J}$$
</div>

**(b)** Temperature increase:

Mass of affected tissue:
<div class="equation">
$$m = \rho V = (300)(25.0 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.00750 \text{ kg} = 7.50 \text{ g}$$
</div>

Temperature increase:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc} = \frac{442}{(0.00750)(3500)} = \frac{442}{26.25} = 16.8\text{ºC}$$
</div>

**(c)** A temperature increase of 16.8ºC would raise the tissue temperature from about 37ºC to about 54ºC. This is warm but not immediately damaging, especially considering that:

1. **The callus is dead tissue** - It doesn't contain living cells, nerves, or blood vessels, so it can tolerate higher temperatures without pain or damage
2. **Brief contact** - The 1-second contact time is too short for significant heat penetration into deeper, living tissue
3. **Protective barrier** - The callus acts as an insulating layer protecting the living tissue beneath
4. **Below burn threshold** - Burns typically require temperatures above 55-60ºC for several seconds, and the living tissue beneath stays cooler

This explains why experienced firewalkers with thick calluses can walk on coals without injury—the combination of brief contact, low thermal conductivity, and the protective dead tissue layer prevents dangerous heat transfer to living cells.

**Answer**

(a) Heat transferred: **442 J**
(b) Temperature increase: **16.8ºC**
(c) This temperature increase is **not dangerous** because the callus consists of dead cells that protect the living tissue beneath. The brief contact time prevents significant heat from reaching sensitive, living tissue.

(a) What is the rate of heat conduction through the 3.00-cm-thick fur of a large animal having a  $$1.40 {\text{-m}}^{2} $$
 surface area? Assume that the animal's skin temperature is  $$ 32.0\text{ºC} $$ ,
 that the air temperature is  $$-5.00\text{ºC} $$ ,
 and that fur has the same thermal conductivity as air. (b) What food intake will the animal need in one day to replace this heat transfer?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the heat conduction equation $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d}$$ with the thermal conductivity of air (since fur's effectiveness comes from trapping air). For part (b), we calculate the total energy lost in one day and convert to kilocalories of food energy.

**Solution**

Given:
- Surface area: $$A = 1.40 \text{ m}^2$$
- Fur thickness: $$d = 3.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0300 \text{ m}$$
- Skin temperature: $$T_{skin} = 32.0\text{ºC}$$
- Air temperature: $$T_{air} = -5.00\text{ºC}$$
- Thermal conductivity (air/fur): $$k = 0.023 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (from Table 1)

**(a)** Rate of heat conduction:

Temperature difference:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = T_{skin} - T_{air} = 32.0 - (-5.00) = 37.0\text{ºC}$$
</div>

Heat conduction rate:
<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d} = \frac{(0.023)(1.40)(37.0)}{0.0300}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{1.1914}{0.0300} = 39.7 \text{ W}$$
</div>

**(b)** Daily food intake needed:

Energy lost in one day:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{day} = P \times t = (39.7 \text{ W})(86400 \text{ s/day}) = 3430080 \text{ J}$$
</div>

Convert to kilocalories (1 kcal = 4186 J):
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{day} = \frac{3430080 \text{ J}}{4186 \text{ J/kcal}} = 819 \text{ kcal} \approx 820 \text{ kcal}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The heat loss rate of 39.7 W is quite modest despite the large temperature difference (37°C) and substantial surface area (1.40 m²). This demonstrates the remarkable insulating ability of fur. The key is that fur traps air in tiny pockets between hair strands, and air is an excellent insulator (k = 0.023 J/s·m·ºC, one of the lowest values in Table 1).

The 3-cm thick fur provides an R-factor of:
<div class="equation">
$$R = \frac{d}{k} = \frac{0.03}{0.023} = 1.30 \text{ m}^2\cdot\text{ºC/W}$$
</div>

For comparison with human clothing:
- **3 cm of fur**: 39.7 W heat loss
- **Heavy winter coat** (similar thickness): Comparable insulation
- **No insulation** (bare skin): Would lose >1000 W in -5°C air (life-threatening)

The daily food requirement of 820 kcal is substantial but manageable for a large animal. For context:
- This is roughly 30-40% of a typical large mammal's daily energy budget
- Additional energy is needed for activity, digestion, and other bodily functions
- Total daily intake might be 2000-3000 kcal for a large herbivore

Arctic and cold-climate animals have evolved several adaptations:
1. **Thick fur** (polar bears: 5-10 cm; musk oxen: up to 60 cm including guard hairs)
2. **Fat layer (blubber)** beneath skin for additional insulation
3. **Countercurrent heat exchange** in limbs to conserve core heat
4. **Smaller extremities** to reduce surface area (Allen's rule)
5. **Larger body size** for favorable volume-to-surface ratio (Bergmann's rule)

This problem explains why Arctic mammals can survive extreme cold—their fur creates an effective barrier to heat loss, requiring only moderate increases in food intake.

**Answer**

(a) The rate of heat conduction through the fur is **39.7 W**.
(b) The animal needs **820 kcal** of food per day to replace this heat loss.

$$d = \frac{15.2}{150} = 0.101 \text{ m} = 10.1 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The blubber thickness of approximately 10 cm is very reasonable for a walrus. Arctic marine mammals like walruses, seals, and whales have evolved thick layers of blubber (typically 5-15 cm) that serve multiple functions:

1. **Thermal insulation** - As calculated here, preventing excessive heat loss in frigid waters
2. **Energy storage** - Blubber stores energy for times when food is scarce
3. **Buoyancy** - Fat is less dense than water, helping the animal float

The relatively modest heat loss rate of 150 W for such a large animal in freezing water demonstrates the remarkable insulating properties of blubber. For comparison, a human in the same conditions without insulation would lose heat at a rate exceeding 1000 W, leading to rapid hypothermia. The low thermal conductivity of fatty tissue (0.2 J/s·m·ºC) combined with the substantial thickness creates an effective thermal barrier.

Walruses can maintain their core body temperature even when spending hours in water near 0ºC, thanks to this thick blubber layer. The 150 W heat loss represents the walrus's basal metabolic heat production, which is easily maintained through normal metabolism.

**Answer**

The average thickness of the walrus's blubber is **10.1 cm** or **0.101 m**.

We use the heat conduction equation $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d}$$ and solve for the temperature difference $$\Delta T$$. The thermal conductivity of wool can be found in Table 1.

- Rate of heat transfer: $$\frac{Q}{t} = 50.0 \text{ W}$$
- Thickness: $$d = 2.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0200 \text{ m}$$

$$\Delta T = \frac{1.00}{0.056} = 17.9\text{ºC}$$

**Discussion**

The temperature difference of about 18ºC across the wool clothing is quite reasonable. This means if the person's skin temperature is 33ºC and they're losing heat at 50 W, the outside surface of the clothing would be at approximately 15ºC. This temperature gradient demonstrates why wool is such an effective insulator for cold weather clothing.

The heat loss rate of 50 W is modest compared to typical human metabolic rates (basal rate ~80-100 W at rest). This means the wool clothing is doing an excellent job of retaining body heat. The low thermal conductivity of wool (0.04 J/s·m·ºC) combined with the 2-cm thickness creates effective insulation. Wool achieves this by trapping air in the spaces between fibers—air itself being a poor conductor (k = 0.023 J/s·m·ºC).

This calculation explains why:
- Wool is preferred for cold-weather clothing
- Layering (increasing total thickness) significantly improves insulation
- Wet wool loses much of its insulating ability (water fills the air spaces and has higher conductivity)
- Wind requires wind-resistant outer layers (to prevent convective heat loss that bypasses the conduction barrier)

**Answer**

The temperature difference across the wool clothing is **17.9ºC** or approximately **18ºC**.

One easy way to reduce heating (and cooling) costs is to add extra insulation in the attic of a house. Suppose the house already had 15 cm of fiberglass insulation in the attic and in all the exterior surfaces. If you added an extra 8.0 cm of fiberglass to the attic, then by what percentage would the heating cost of the house drop? Take the single story house to be of dimensions 10 m by 15 m by 3.0 m. Ignore air infiltration and heat loss through windows and doors.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to calculate the heat loss through all surfaces before and after adding insulation to the attic. The attic (ceiling) will have reduced heat loss with thicker insulation, while the walls and floor maintain their original insulation. We use the conduction equation to compare the total heat loss rates.

**Solution**

Given:
- House dimensions: 10 m × 15 m × 3.0 m
- Original attic insulation: $$d_1 = 15 \text{ cm} = 0.15 \text{ m}$$
- Additional attic insulation: $$8.0 \text{ cm}$$
- Final attic insulation: $$d_2 = 23 \text{ cm} = 0.23 \text{ m}$$
- Wall/floor insulation: $$d_{wall} = 0.15 \text{ m}$$ (unchanged)
- Thermal conductivity of glass wool (fiberglass): $$k = 0.042 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$ (from Table 1)

Calculate surface areas:
- Attic (ceiling): $$A_{attic} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ m}^2$$
- Two long walls: $$A_{long} = 2 \times (15 \times 3.0) = 90 \text{ m}^2$$
- Two short walls: $$A_{short} = 2 \times (10 \times 3.0) = 60 \text{ m}^2$$
- Floor: $$A_{floor} = 150 \text{ m}^2$$
- Total wall area: $$A_{walls} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ m}^2$$

For constant $$\Delta T$$, the heat loss rate is $$\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{d}$$.

**Before adding insulation:**
<div class="equation">
$$\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)_{before} = \frac{kA_{attic}\Delta T}{d_1} + \frac{kA_{walls}\Delta T}{d_{wall}} + \frac{kA_{floor}\Delta T}{d_{wall}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)_{before} = k\Delta T \left(\frac{150}{0.15} + \frac{150}{0.15} + \frac{150}{0.15}\right) = k\Delta T(1000 + 1000 + 1000) = 3000 k\Delta T$$
</div>

**After adding insulation:**
<div class="equation">
$$\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)_{after} = \frac{kA_{attic}\Delta T}{d_2} + \frac{kA_{walls}\Delta T}{d_{wall}} + \frac{kA_{floor}\Delta T}{d_{wall}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)_{after} = k\Delta T \left(\frac{150}{0.23} + \frac{150}{0.15} + \frac{150}{0.15}\right) = k\Delta T(652 + 1000 + 1000) = 2652 k\Delta T$$
</div>

**Percentage reduction:**
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Reduction} = \frac{(Q/t)_{before} - (Q/t)_{after}}{(Q/t)_{before}} \times 100\%$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\text{Reduction} = \frac{3000 - 2652}{3000} \times 100\% = \frac{348}{3000} \times 100\% = 11.6\%$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Adding 8.0 cm of fiberglass insulation to the attic reduces heating costs by approximately 11.6%. While this might seem modest, it represents significant savings over the lifetime of a house. The attic accounts for one-third of the total surface area, so improving its insulation from 15 cm to 23 cm (a 53% increase in thickness) reduces its heat loss by 35% [(1000-652)/1000 = 34.8%].

The overall reduction is smaller (11.6%) because the walls and floor still lose heat at the original rate. To achieve greater savings, one would need to insulate all surfaces more heavily. However, attic insulation is often prioritized because:
- Hot air rises, concentrating heat loss through the ceiling
- Attics are easier to access and insulate than walls
- The cost-effectiveness is high (discussed in the next problem)

This calculation assumes constant temperature difference and ignores windows, doors, and air infiltration, which in reality account for substantial heat loss. Nonetheless, it demonstrates the quantitative benefit of added insulation.

**Answer**

Heating costs would drop by approximately **11.6%** or about **12%**.

Many decisions are made on the basis of the payback period: the time it will take through savings to equal the capital cost of an investment. Acceptable payback times depend upon the business or philosophy one has. (For some industries, a payback period is as small as two years.) Suppose you wish to install the extra insulation in [[Exercise 12]](#Exercise12). If energy cost  \$1.00 per million joules and the insulation was  \$4.00 per square meter, then calculate the simple payback time. Take the average  $$\Delta T $$
 for the 120 day heating season to be  $$15.0\text{ºC} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to calculate: (1) the cost of the additional insulation, (2) the energy saved per heating season from Exercise 12, and (3) the monetary value of that energy savings. The payback time is the installation cost divided by the annual savings.

**Solution**

Given:
- Energy cost: $$\$1.00$$ per million joules = $$\$1.00$$ per MJ
- Insulation cost: $$\$4.00$$ per m²
- Attic area: $$A = 150 \text{ m}^2$$ (from Exercise 12)
- Temperature difference: $$\Delta T = 15.0\text{ºC}$$
- Heating season: $$t = 120 \text{ days}$$
- Thermal conductivity of fiberglass: $$k = 0.042 \text{ J/s}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{ºC}$$

From Exercise 12, the reduction in heat loss rate due to adding 8.0 cm to the attic is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right) = k\Delta T \left(\frac{A}{d_1} - \frac{A}{d_2}\right) = k\Delta T \cdot A \left(\frac{1}{0.15} - \frac{1}{0.23}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right) = (0.042)(15.0)(150)(6.667 - 4.348) = (0.042)(15.0)(150)(2.319)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\left(\frac{Q}{t}\right) = 219 \text{ W} = 219 \text{ J/s}$$
</div>

**Energy saved per heating season:**

Convert time to seconds:
<div class="equation">
$$t = 120 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ h/day} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 1.037 \times 10^7 \text{ s}$$
</div>

Total energy saved:
<div class="equation">
$$Q_{saved} = (219 \text{ J/s})(1.037 \times 10^7 \text{ s}) = 2.27 \times 10^9 \text{ J} = 2270 \text{ MJ}$$
</div>

**Monetary savings per season:**
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Savings} = 2270 \text{ MJ} \times \$1.00/\text{MJ} = \$2270$$
</div>

**Installation cost:**
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Cost} = 150 \text{ m}^2 \times \$4.00/\text{m}^2 = \$600$$
</div>

**Payback time:**
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Payback time} = \frac{\text{Installation cost}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$600}{\$2270} = 0.264 \text{ heating seasons}$$
</div>

Since heating seasons occur annually:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Payback time} = 0.264 \text{ years} = 3.2 \text{ months}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The payback period of approximately 0.26 years (about 3 months of a heating season, or roughly one-quarter of a year) is extremely attractive from an investment standpoint. This means the homeowner would recover the \$600 installation cost in energy savings within the first heating season!

This excellent return on investment explains why adding attic insulation is one of the most cost-effective energy efficiency improvements. After the payback period, the homeowner continues to save \$2270 per heating season for the life of the house (typically 20-30 years or more). The total lifetime savings would exceed \$45,000-\$68,000.

Factors making this attractive:
- Low installation cost (\$600)
- Significant energy savings (\$2270/year)
- Easy installation (attic access is simple)
- Long-lasting benefit (insulation lasts decades)

In reality, energy costs fluctuate and are often higher than \$1.00/MJ (especially for electricity or oil heating), which would make the payback even faster. This problem demonstrates why energy auditors consistently recommend adding attic insulation as a top priority for reducing heating costs.

**Answer**

The simple payback time is approximately **0.264 years**, or about **3.2 months** of the heating season, or approximately **one-quarter of a year**.
