Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For example, we
can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and
listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying the kinematics developed
so far to falling objects, we can examine some interesting situations and learn
much about gravity in the process.

### Gravity

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that, if air
resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects
fall toward the center of Earth with the _same constant acceleration,
independent of their mass_. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected,
because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that
we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones.

![Positions of a feather and hammer over time as they fall on the Moon. The feather and hammer are at the exact same position at each moment in time.](../resources/Figure_02_07_01.jpg 'A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to gravity is only ( 1.67 \\mss ) ')
{: #Figure1}

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than
a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach the ground after a
hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the
difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an
object through the air, while friction between objects—such as between clothes
and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also
opposes motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few
chapters, an object _falling without air resistance or friction_ is defined to
be in **free-fall**.

The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The
acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the **acceleration due
to gravity**. The acceleration due to gravity is _constant_, which means we can
apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and
friction are negligible. This opens a broad class of interesting situations to
us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given
its own symbol, $$ g $$. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has
the average value

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=9.80 \mss . $$
</div>

Although $$ g $$ varies from $$ 9.78 \mss $$ to $$ 9.83 \mss $$, depending on
latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local topography, the
average value of $$ 9.80 \mss $$ will be used in this text unless otherwise
specified. The direction of the acceleration due to gravity is *downward (
towards the center of Earth)*. In fact, its direction *defines* what we call
vertical. Note that whether the acceleration $$ a $$ in the kinematic equations
has the value $$ +g $$ or $$ -g $$ depends on how we define our coordinate
system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then $$ a=-g=-9.80 \mss
$$, and if we define the downward direction as positive, then $$ a=g=9.80 \mss

$$
.

### One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity

The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start
with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So we
start by considering straight up and down motion with no air resistance or
friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if there is any) is
vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero. Once
the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in
free-fall. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has
constant acceleration of magnitude $$ g $$. We will also represent vertical
displacement with the symbol $$ y $$ and use $$ x $$ for horizontal
displacement.

Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Upward
</div>
A person standing on the edge of a
high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s.
The rock misses the edge of the cliff as it falls back to earth.
Calculate the position and velocity of the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s after it
is thrown, neglecting the effects of air resistance.

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![Velocity vector arrow pointing up in the positive y direction, labeled v sub 0 equals thirteen point 0 meters per second. Acceleration vector arrow pointing down in the negative y direction, labeled a equals negative 9 point 8 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_07_02.jpg
"Velocity and Acceleration Sketch")
{: #Figure2}

We are asked to determine the position $$ y $$ at various times. It is
reasonable to take the initial position $$ y_{0} $$ to be zero. This problem
involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We use plus and minus
signs to indicate direction, with up being positive and down negative. Since up
is positive, and the rock is thrown upward, the initial velocity must be
positive too. The acceleration due to gravity is downward, so $$ a $$ is
negative. It is crucial that the initial velocity and the acceleration due to
gravity have opposite signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due
to gravity opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.

Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times, we will
refer to these as $$ y_{1} $$ and $$ v_{1} $$; $$ y_{2} $$ and $$ v_{2} $$; and
$$ y_{3} $$ and $$ v_{3} $$.

**Solution for Position** $$ y_{1} $$

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that $$ y_{0}=0 $$; $$ v_{0}=13.0 \ms $$; $$
a=-g=-9.80 \mss $$; and $$ t=1.00 \s $$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. We will use $$ y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}
at^{2} $$ because it includes only one unknown, $$ y $$ (or $$ y_{1} $$, here),
which is the value we want to find.

3\. Plug in the known values and solve for $$ y_{1} $$.

<div class="equation">
 $$ y_{1}=0+\left(13.0 \ms \right)\left(1.00 \s \right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(-9.80\mss \right){\left(1.00 \s \right)}^{2}=8.10\m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The rock is 8.10 m above its starting point at $$ t=1.00 \s $$, since $$ y_{1}>
y_
{0} $$. It could be *moving* up or down; the only way to tell is to calculate $$
v_{1} $$ and find out if it is positive or negative.

**Solution for Velocity** $$ v_{1} $$

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that $$ y_{0}=0 $$; $$ v_{0}=13.0 \ms $$; $$
a=-g=-9.80 \mss $$; and $$ t=1.00 \s $$. We also know from the solution above
that $$ y_{1}=8.10 \m $$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. The most straightforward is $$ v=v_{0}-gt
$$

(from $$ v=v\_{0}+at $$, where $$ a=\text{gravitational acceleration}=-g $$).

3\. Plug in the knowns and solve.

<div class="equation">
 $$ v_{1}=v_{0}-gt= 13.0 \ms -\left(9.80 \mss \right)
\left(1.00 \s \right)=3.20 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The positive value for $$ v\_{1} $$ means that the rock is still heading upward
at $$ t=1.00\s $$. However, it has slowed from its original 13.0\*\* m/s, as
expected.

**Solution for Remaining Times**

The procedures for calculating the position and velocity at $$ t=2.00\s $$ and
$$ 3.00 \s $$ are the same as those above. The results are summarized
in [Table 1](#Table1) and illustrated in [Figure 3](#Figure3).

Graphing the data helps us understand it more clearly.

![Three panels showing three graphs. The top panel shows a graph of vertical position in meters versus time in seconds. The line begins at the origin and has a positive slope that decreases over time until it hits a turning point between seconds 1 and 2. After that it has a negative slope that increases over time. The middle panel shows a graph of velocity in meters per second versus time in seconds. The line is straight, with a negative slope, beginning at time zero velocity of thirteen meters per second and ending at time 3 seconds with a velocity just over negative sixteen meters per second. The bottom panel shows a graph of acceleration in meters per second squared versus time in seconds. The line is straight and flat at a y value of negative 9 point 80 meters per second squared from time 0 to time 3 seconds.](../resources/Figure_02_07_03.jpg 'Vertical position, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration vs. time for a rock thrown vertically up at the edge of a cliff. Notice that velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant. Misconception Alert! Notice that the position vs. time graph shows vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph shows some horizontal motion;the shape of the graph looks like the path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is time, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up, and straight down.')
{: #Figure3}

**Discussion**

The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is above
its starting point and heading upward, since $$ y*{1} $$ and $$ v*{1} $$ are
both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its starting point, but the
negative velocity means it is moving downward. At 3.00 s, both $$ y*{3} $$ and
$$ v*{3} $$ are negative, meaning the rock is below its starting point and
continuing to move downward. Notice that when the rock is at its highest point (
at 1.3 s), its velocity is zero, but its acceleration is still $$ -9.80 \mss $$.
Its acceleration is $$ -9.80 \mss $$ for the whole trip—while it is moving up
and while it is moving down. Note that the values for $$ y $$ are the
positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances traveled.
Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well as downward. Both
have the same acceleration—the acceleration due to gravity, which remains
constant the entire time. Astronauts training in the famous Vomit Comet, for
example, experience free-fall while arcing up as well as down, as we will
discuss in more detail later.

Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down
</div>
What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down, instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been thrown downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s.

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![Velocity vector arrow pointing down in the negative y direction and labeled v sub zero equals negative thirteen point 0 meters per second. Acceleration vector arrow also pointing down in the negative y direction, labeled a equals negative 9 point 80 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_07_04.jpg 'Velocity and Accelerator Sketch')
{: #Figure4}

Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative because it
finishes below the starting point at $$ y\_{0}=0 $$. Similarly, the initial
velocity is downward and therefore negative, as is the acceleration due to
gravity. We expect the final velocity to be negative since the rock will
continue to move downward.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ y*{0}=0 $$; $$ y*{1}=-5.10 \m $$; $$ v\_
{0}=-13.0 \ms $$; $$ a=-g=-9.80 \mss $$.

2\. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the problem.
The equation $$ v^{2}=v*{0}^{2}+2a\left(y-y*{0}\right) $$ works well because the
only unknown in it is $$ v $$. (We will plug $$ y\_{1} $$ in for $$ y $$.)

3\. Enter the known values

<div class="equation">
 $$ v^{2}={\left(-13.0 \ms \right)}^{2}+
2\left(-9.80 \mss \right)
\left(-5.10 \m -0 \m \right)=268.96 \mmss , $$
</div>
where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an intermediate result.

Taking the square root, and noting that a square root can be positive or
negative, gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ v= \pm  16.4 \ms . $$
</div>
The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading down. Thus,

<div class="equation">
 $$ v=-16.4 \ms . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Note that _this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this position when
it was thrown straight upward with the same initial speed_. (
See [Example 1](#example1) and [Figure 5](#Figure5)(a).) This is not a coincidental
result. Because we only consider the acceleration due to gravity in this
problem, the _speed_ of a falling object depends only on its initial speed and
its vertical position relative to the starting point. For example, if the
velocity of the rock is calculated at a height of 8.10 m above the starting
point (using the method from [Example 1](#example1)) when the initial velocity
is 13.0 m/s straight up, a result of $$ \pm 3.20 \ms $$ is obtained. Here both
signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs when the rock is at 8.10 m and
heading up, and the negative value occurs when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading
back down. It has the same _speed_ but the opposite direction.

![Two figures are shown. At left, a man standing on the edge of a cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial speed of thirteen meters per second. At right, the man throws the rock straight down with a speed of thirteen meters per second. In both figures, a line indicates the rock’s trajectory. When the rock is thrown straight up, it has a speed of minus sixteen point four meters per second at minus five point one zero meters below the point where the man released the rock. When the rock is thrown straight down, the velocity is the same at this position.](../resources/Figure_02_07_05.jpg "(a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in <a href="#example1">Example 1</a>. The arrows are velocity vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 s. (b) A person throws a rock straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in <a href="#example2">Example 2</a>. Note that at the same distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in both cases. ")
{: #Figure5}

Another way to look at it is this: In [Example 1](#example1), the rock is thrown
up with an initial velocity of $$ 13.0 \ms $$. It rises and then falls back
down. When its position is $$ y=0 $$ on its way back down, its velocity is $$
-13.0 \ms $$. That is, it has the same speed on its way down as on its way up.
We would then expect its velocity at a position of $$ y=-5.10 \m $$ to be the
same whether we have thrown it upwards at $$ +13.0 \ms $$ or thrown it downwards
at $$ -13.0 \ms $$. The velocity of the rock on its way down from $$ y=0 $$ is
the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start with, as long as the
speed with which it was initially thrown is the same.

Find *g* from Data on a Falling Object
</div>
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example, [Figure 6](#Figure6). Very precise results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed time.

![Figure has four panels. The first panel (on the top) is an illustration of a ball falling toward the ground at intervals of one tenth of a second. The space between the vertical position of the ball at one time step and the next increases with each time step. At time equals 0, position and velocity are also 0. At time equals 0 point 1 seconds, y position equals negative 0 point 049 meters and velocity is negative 0 point 98 meters per second. At 0 point 5 seconds, y position is negative 1 point 225 meters and velocity is negative 4 point 90 meters per second. The second panel (in the middle) is a line graph of position in meters versus time in seconds. Line begins at the origin and slopes down with increasingly negative slope. The third panel (bottom left) is a line graph of velocity in meters per second versus time in seconds. Line is straight, beginning at the origin and with a constant negative slope. The fourth panel (bottom right) is a line graph of acceleration in meters per second squared versus time in seconds. Line is flat, at a constant y value of negative 9 point 80 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_07_06.jpg 'Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly with time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a constant and is equal to gravitational acceleration.')
{: #Figure6}

Suppose the ball falls 1.0000 m in 0.45173 s. Assuming the ball is not affected
by air resistance, what is the precise acceleration due to gravity at this
location?

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![The figure shows a green dot labeled v sub zero equals zero meters per second, a purple downward pointing arrow labeled a equals question mark, and an x y coordinate system with the y axis pointing vertically up and the x axis pointing horizontally to the right.](../resources/Figure_02_07_07.jpg)
{: #Figure7}

We need to solve for acceleration $$ a $$. Note that in this case, displacement
is downward and therefore negative, as is acceleration.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ y*{0}=0 $$; $$ y=-1.0000 \m $$; $$ t=0.45173 \s $$;
$$ v*{0}=0 $$.

2\. Choose the equation that allows you to solve for $$ a $$ using the known
values.

<div class="equation">
 $$ y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}a t^{2} $$
</div>
3\. Substitute 0 for $$ v_{0} $$ and rearrange the equation to solve for $$
a $$. Substituting 0 for $$ v_{0} $$ yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ y=y_{0}+\frac{1}{2}a t^{2}. $$
</div>
Solving for $$ a $$ gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{2\left(y-y_{0}\right)}{ t^{2}}. $$
</div>
4\. Substitute known values yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{2\left(-1.0000 \m  - 0 \right)}
{\left(0.45173 \s \right)^{2}}=-9.8010\mss ,$$
</div>
so, because $$ a=-g $$ with the directions we have chosen,

<div class="equation">
 $$ g=9.8010 \mss . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The negative value for $$ a $$ indicates that the gravitational acceleration is
downward, as expected. We expect the value to be somewhere around the average
value of $$ 9.80 \mss $$, so $$ 9.8010 \mss $$ makes sense. Since the data going
into the calculation are relatively precise, this value for $$ g $$ is more
precise than the average value of $$ 9.80 \mss $$; it represents the local value
for the acceleration due to gravity.

### Section Summary

- An object in free-fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is
  negligible.
- On Earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration due to gravity $$ g

  $$
  , which averages
  <div class="equation">
  $$ g=9.80 \mss . $$
  </div>
  $$

- Whether the acceleration $$a$$ should be taken as $$ +g $$ or $$ -g $$ is
  determined by your choice of coordinate system. If you choose the upward
  direction as positive, $$ a=-g=-9.80 \mss $$ is negative. In the opposite
  case, $$ a=+g=9.80 \mss $$ is positive. Since acceleration is constant, the
  kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate $$ +g $$ or $$
  -g $$ substituted for $$ a $$.
- For objects in free-fall, up is normally taken as positive for displacement,
  velocity, and acceleration.

**Strategy**

Use the kinematic equations for free-fall with upward as positive. Since the ball is thrown upward, the initial velocity is positive, while the acceleration due to gravity is negative ($$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$).

**Solution**

For position: $$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = v_0 t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$

For velocity: $$ v = v_0 + at = v_0 - gt $$

**(a) At t = 0.500 s:**

<div class="equation">
$$ y_1 = (15.0 \ms)(0.500 \s) - \frac{1}{2}(9.80 \mss)(0.500 \s)^2 = 7.50 \m - 1.23 \m = 6.28 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_1 = 15.0 \ms - (9.80 \mss)(0.500 \s) = 15.0 \ms - 4.90 \ms = 10.1 \ms $$

$$ y_2 = (15.0 \ms)(1.00 \s) - \frac{1}{2}(9.80 \mss)(1.00 \s)^2 = 15.0 \m - 4.90 \m = 10.1 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_2 = 15.0 \ms - (9.80 \mss)(1.00 \s) = 5.20 \ms $$

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take downward as positive since the rock is thrown downward. This means the initial velocity $$ v_0 = +14.0 \ms $$ and $$ a = +g = +9.80 \mss $$. Set $$ y_0 = 0 $$ at the bridge.

**Solution**

For position: $$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$

For velocity: $$ v = v_0 + gt $$

**(a) At t = 0.500 s:**

<div class="equation">
$$ y_1 = (14.0 \ms)(0.500 \s) + \frac{1}{2}(9.80 \mss)(0.500 \s)^2 = 7.00 \m + 1.23 \m = 8.23 \m $$

At 2.50 s, the rock has fallen 65.6 m, which is still above the water (70.0 m below the bridge). The rock continues to accelerate as it falls.

A basketball referee tosses the ball straight up for the starting tip-off.
At what minimum velocity must a basketball player leave the ground to rise 1.25 m
above the floor in an attempt to get the ball?
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

At the maximum height, the player's velocity is zero. We can use the kinematic equation relating velocity, displacement, and acceleration to find the initial velocity needed to reach 1.25 m.

**Solution**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Maximum height: $$ y = 1.25 \m $$
   - Final velocity at maximum height: $$ v = 0 $$
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$ (taking upward as positive)

2. Choose the appropriate kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$

3. Solve for initial velocity $$ v_0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = v_0^2 + 2(-9.80 \mss)(1.25 \m - 0) $$

This is a reasonable jumping speed for an athlete. The calculation shows that to reach a height of 1.25 m, a player must leave the ground with a velocity of about 5 m/s (approximately 18 km/h).

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The swimmer launches upward from the diving board with initial velocity $$ v_0 = 4.00 \ms $$, reaches a maximum height, then falls through the air until her feet hit the water 1.80 m below the starting point. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

**(a) Time in the air:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = +4.00 \ms $$ (upward)
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$ (at the board)
   - Final position: $$ y = -1.80 \m $$ (at water level, below the board)
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation for displacement:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ -1.80 = 0 + (4.00)t + \frac{1}{2}(-9.80)t^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ -1.80 = 4.00t - 4.90t^2 $$
</div>

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:

<div class="equation">
$$ 4.90t^2 - 4.00t - 1.80 = 0 $$

4. Apply the quadratic formula $$ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{4.00 \pm \sqrt{(-4.00)^2 + 4(4.90)(1.80)}}{2(4.90)} = \frac{4.00 \pm \sqrt{16.0 + 35.28}}{9.80} $$

$$ t = \frac{4.00 \pm \sqrt{51.28}}{9.80} = \frac{4.00 \pm 7.16}{9.80} $$

**(c) Velocity when feet hit the water:**

</div>

Taking the negative root (downward motion):

<div class="equation">
$$ v = -7.16 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The swimmer is in the air for about 1.1 seconds, which is reasonable for a dive. She rises 0.816 m (about 82 cm) above the board before falling. Her final velocity of 7.16 m/s downward is greater in magnitude than her initial upward velocity because she falls through a greater distance (1.80 m) than she rises (0.82 m). The symmetry of projectile motion would give her a velocity of -4.00 m/s when passing the board on the way down; the additional 1.80 m of fall increases her speed further.

**Answer**

(a) The swimmer's feet are in the air for $$ 1.14 \s $$.

(b) The highest point above the board is $$ 0.816 \m $$ (or about 81.6 cm).

(c) Her velocity when her feet hit the water is $$ 7.16 \ms $$ downward.

**(a) Height of the cliff:**

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The shot is released at height 2.20 m with initial upward velocity of 11.0 m/s. The shot putter is 1.80 m tall, so his head is at 1.80 m. We need to find when the shot returns to this height on its way back down. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 2.20 \m $$ (release height)
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = +11.0 \ms $$ (upward)
   - Final position: $$ y = 1.80 \m $$ (height of his head)

**Discussion**

The negative time solution represents when the shot would have been at head height before being released (if we extended the trajectory backward in time), which is not physically relevant. The positive solution of 2.28 s is the time when the shot passes his head height on the way back down. This gives him just over 2 seconds to move out of the way after releasing the shot - not much time! The shot goes up, reaches a maximum height above his release point, then comes back down and passes head level at 2.28 s.

**Answer**

The shot putter has $$ 2.28 \s $$ (about 2.3 seconds) to get out of the way before the shot comes back down to head level.

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The ball passes the tree branch twice: once on the way up and once on the way down. We need to find both times when the ball is at height 7.00 m, then calculate the difference between these times.

**Solution**

Given:
- Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 15.0 \ms $$
- Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$ (ground level)
- Height of tree branch: $$ y = 7.00 \m $$
- Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

6. The additional time between passing the branch on the way up and on the way down:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = 2.49 \s - 0.575 \s = 1.91 \s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ball passes the tree branch at 0.575 s on its way up and again at 2.49 s on its way down, giving an additional time of 1.91 s. This result makes sense because of the symmetry of projectile motion: the ball takes the same amount of time to go from the branch to its maximum height as it does to fall from maximum height back to the branch. Since the ball reaches its maximum height at $$ t = \frac{v_0}{g} = \frac{15.0}{9.80} = 1.53 \s $$, the time from the first branch crossing to the peak is $$ 1.53 - 0.575 = 0.96 \s $$, and from the peak back to the branch is another 0.96 s, giving a total of 1.91 s. This symmetry is a fundamental property of motion under constant acceleration.

**Answer**

The ball will pass the tree branch on the way down **1.91 s** after passing it on the way up.

A kangaroo can jump over an object 2.50 m high.
(a) Calculate its vertical speed when it leaves the ground.
(b) How long is it in the air?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The kangaroo leaves the ground with some initial velocity, reaches a maximum height of 2.50 m where its velocity becomes zero, then returns to the ground. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

**(a) Vertical speed when leaving the ground:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$ (ground level)
   - Maximum height: $$ y = 2.50 \m $$
   - Velocity at maximum height: $$ v = 0 \ms $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation relating velocity, displacement, and acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Solve for initial velocity $$ v_0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = v_0^2 + 2(-9.80)(2.50 - 0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = v_0^2 - 2(9.80)(2.50) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0^2 = 2(9.80)(2.50) = 49.0 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0 = \sqrt{49.0} = 7.00 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Time in the air:**

Method 1: Use the velocity equation to find time to reach maximum height, then double it.

1. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = v_0 + at $$
</div>

2. At maximum height, $$ v = 0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = 7.00 + (-9.80)t $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 9.80t = 7.00 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{7.00}{9.80} = 0.714 \s $$
</div>

3. This is the time to reach maximum height. By symmetry, the total time in the air is:
<div class="equation">
$$ t_{total} = 2 \times 0.714 = 1.43 \s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

A takeoff speed of 7.00 m/s (about 25 km/h) is quite impressive for an animal jump. The kangaroo can clear a 2.50 m obstacle, which is taller than most humans. The total air time of 1.43 seconds is reasonable - the kangaroo spends about 0.71 seconds going up and 0.71 seconds coming down. This symmetric motion is characteristic of free-fall under constant gravitational acceleration.

**Answer**

(a) The kangaroo leaves the ground with a vertical speed of $$ 7.00 \ms $$.

(b) The kangaroo is in the air for $$ 1.43 \s $$ (about 1.4 seconds).

An object is dropped from a height of 75.0 m above ground level.
(a) Determine the distance traveled during the first second.
(b) Determine the final velocity at which the object hits the ground.
(c) Determine the distance traveled during the last second of motion before hitting the ground.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take downward as positive since the object is dropped and falls downward. The initial velocity is zero (dropped, not thrown). Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

**(a) Distance traveled during the first second:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 0 $$ (dropped from rest)
   - Time: $$ t = 1.00 \s $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = g = 9.80 \mss $$ (downward, positive)

2. Use the kinematic equation for displacement:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(1.00)^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(1.00) = 4.90 \m $$
</div>

**(b) Final velocity when hitting the ground:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 0 $$
   - Total displacement: $$ y = 75.0 \m $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = g = 9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ay $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 0 + 2(9.80)(75.0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 1470 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \sqrt{1470} = 38.3 \ms $$
</div>

**(c) Distance traveled during the last second:**

First, find the total time to fall 75.0 m:

1. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 75.0 = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(9.80)t^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t^2 = \frac{2(75.0)}{9.80} = 15.31 \s^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t = 3.91 \s $$
</div>

2. Now find the distance fallen at $$ t = 2.91 \s $$ (one second before hitting the ground):
<div class="equation">
$$ y_{2.91} = \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(2.91)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(8.468) = 41.5 \m $$
</div>

3. The distance traveled during the last second is:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = 75.0 - 41.5 = 33.5 \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The object falls only 4.90 m in the first second but travels 33.5 m in the last second - nearly 7 times as far! This illustrates how falling objects accelerate continuously. The final velocity of 38.3 m/s (about 138 km/h or 86 mph) is quite fast, which explains why falling from such heights is dangerous. The asymmetry between the first and last seconds demonstrates that the object is continuously gaining speed as it falls.

**Answer**

(a) The object travels $$ 4.90 \m $$ during the first second.

(b) The final velocity when hitting the ground is $$ 38.3 \ms $$ (downward).

(c) The object travels $$ 33.5 \m $$ during the last second of motion before hitting the ground.

A ball is thrown straight up. It passes a 2.00-m-high window 7.50 m off the ground on its path up and takes 0.312 s to go past the window. What was the ball's initial velocity? Hint: First consider only the distance along the window, and solve for the ball's velocity at the bottom of the window. Next, consider only the distance from the ground to the bottom of the window, and solve for the initial velocity using the velocity at the bottom of the window as the final velocity.
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. We'll solve this in two steps as suggested by the hint:

1. First, analyze the motion through the window to find the velocity at the bottom of the window
2. Then, analyze the motion from ground to the bottom of the window to find the initial velocity

**Solution**

**Step 1: Find velocity at the bottom of the window**

The window is 2.00 m high and the ball takes 0.312 s to pass through it.

1. Identify the known values for motion through the window:
   - Displacement through window: $$ \Delta y = 2.00 \m $$
   - Time through window: $$ t = 0.312 \s $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = v_{bottom} t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
</div>

3. Substitute and solve for $$ v\_{bottom} $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 2.00 = v_{bottom}(0.312) + \frac{1}{2}(-9.80)(0.312)^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 2.00 = v_{bottom}(0.312) - 4.90(0.0973) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 2.00 = v_{bottom}(0.312) - 0.477 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{bottom}(0.312) = 2.00 + 0.477 = 2.477 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_{bottom} = \frac{2.477}{0.312} = 7.94 \ms $$
</div>

**Step 2: Find initial velocity from ground to bottom of window**

The bottom of the window is 7.50 m above the ground.

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$
   - Final position (bottom of window): $$ y = 7.50 \m $$
   - Final velocity (at bottom of window): $$ v = 7.94 \ms $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Solve for initial velocity $$ v_0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ (7.94)^2 = v_0^2 + 2(-9.80)(7.50 - 0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 63.0 = v_0^2 - 147 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0^2 = 63.0 + 147 = 210 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0 = \sqrt{210} = 14.5 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ball was thrown with an initial velocity of 14.5 m/s. By the time it reaches the bottom of the window at 7.50 m, it has slowed to 7.94 m/s due to gravity. This is reasonable - the ball is still moving upward but has lost significant speed. The two-step approach allows us to work backwards from the observable motion (passing the window) to find the initial condition.

**Answer**

The ball's initial velocity was $$ 14.5 \ms $$ upward.

Suppose you drop a rock into a dark well and, using precision equipment, you measure the time for the sound of a splash to return.
(a) Neglecting the time required for sound to travel up the well, calculate the distance to the water if the sound returns in 2.0000 s.
(b) Now calculate the distance taking into account the time for sound to travel up the well. The speed of sound is 332.00 m/s in this well.
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take downward as positive. For part (a), we neglect the time for sound to travel up and assume all 2.0000 s is the time for the rock to fall. For part (b), we must account for the fact that the total time includes both the fall time and the sound travel time. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity and a sound speed of 332.00 m/s.

**Solution**

**(a) Neglecting sound travel time:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 0 $$ (dropped from rest)
   - Acceleration: $$ a = g = 9.80 \mss $$ (taking down as positive)
   - Time: $$ t = 2.0000 \s $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(2.0000)^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = \frac{1}{2}(9.80)(4.0000) = 19.6 \m $$
</div>

**(b) Accounting for sound travel time:**

The total time is the sum of the fall time $$ t*{\text{fall}} $$ and the sound travel time $$ t*{\text{sound}} $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{fall}} + t_{\text{sound}} = 2.0000 \s $$
</div>

1. For the falling rock (distance $$ d $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ d = \frac{1}{2}gt_{\text{fall}}^2 $$
</div>

2. For the sound traveling up:
<div class="equation">
$$ d = v_{\text{sound}} \times t_{\text{sound}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{sound}} = \frac{d}{v_{\text{sound}}} = \frac{d}{332.00} $$
</div>

3. Substitute into the total time equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} + \frac{d}{332.00} = 2.0000 $$
</div>

4. But $$ d = \frac{1}{2}gt*{\text{fall}}^2 = 4.90 t*{\text{fall}}^2 $$, so:
<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} + \frac{4.90 t_{\text{fall}}^2}{332.00} = 2.0000 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} + 0.01476 t_{\text{fall}}^2 = 2.0000 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 0.01476 t_{\text{fall}}^2 + t_{\text{fall}} - 2.0000 = 0 $$
</div>

5. Using the quadratic formula:
<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(0.01476)(2.0000)}}{2(0.01476)} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 0.11808}}{0.02952} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1.11808}}{0.02952} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} = \frac{-1 \pm 1.0574}{0.02952} $$
</div>

Taking the positive root:

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{\text{fall}} = \frac{0.0574}{0.02952} = 1.944 \s $$
</div>

6. Calculate the distance:
<div class="equation">
$$ d = 4.90 \times (1.944)^2 = 4.90 \times 3.779 = 18.5 \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

When we account for the time it takes sound to travel up the well, the calculated depth is less than when we ignore it. This makes sense: if the total time is 2.0000 s and some of that time is used for sound to travel up, less time is available for the rock to fall, so it doesn't fall as far. The sound travel time is $$ t\_{\text{sound}} = 2.0000 - 1.944 = 0.056 \s $$, which is about 2.8% of the total time. The difference in calculated depth is about 1.1 m, or about 6% - relatively small but not negligible for precision measurements. This problem illustrates that for accurate measurements, we must consider all relevant physical processes, not just the primary one.

**Answer**

(a) Neglecting the time for sound to travel up the well, the distance to the water is 19.6 m.

(b) Accounting for the time sound takes to travel up the well, the distance to the water is 18.5 m.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The ball falls from rest, hits the floor, and rebounds. We'll analyze the motion in stages: before impact, during collision, and after rebound. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

**(a) Velocity just before striking the floor:**

1. Identify the known values for the downward fall:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 1.50 \m $$
   - Final position: $$ y = 0 $$ (floor level)
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 0 $$ (dropped from rest)
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 0 + 2(-9.80)(0 - 1.50) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 2(-9.80)(-1.50) = 29.4 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \pm \sqrt{29.4} = \pm 5.42 \ms $$
</div>

Taking the negative root (downward motion):

<div class="equation">
$$ v = -5.42 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Velocity just after leaving the floor:**

1. Identify the known values for the upward rebound:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$ (floor level)
   - Final position: $$ y = 1.45 \m $$ (maximum rebound height)
   - Final velocity at max height: $$ v = 0 $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Solve for initial velocity after rebound $$ v_0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = v_0^2 + 2(-9.80)(1.45 - 0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0^2 = 2(9.80)(1.45) = 28.42 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0 = \sqrt{28.42} = +5.33 \ms $$
</div>

**(c) Acceleration during contact with the floor:**

During the collision, the ball's velocity changes from -5.42 m/s to +5.33 m/s.

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = -5.42 \ms $$
   - Final velocity: $$ v = +5.33 \ms $$
   - Time of contact: $$ t = 8.00 \times 10^{-5} \s $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = v_0 + at $$
</div>

3. Solve for acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{v - v_0}{t} = \frac{5.33 - (-5.42)}{8.00 \times 10^{-5}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{10.75}{8.00 \times 10^{-5}} = 1.34 \times 10^{5} \mss $$

**(d) Distance the ball compressed during collision:**

1. Use the kinematic equation with average velocity:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + \frac{v_0 + v}{2}t $$
</div>

2. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = \frac{-5.42 + 5.33}{2} \times (8.00 \times 10^{-5}) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = \frac{-0.09}{2} \times (8.00 \times 10^{-5}) = -3.6 \times 10^{-6} \m $$
</div>

The magnitude of compression is:

<div class="equation">
$$ |\Delta y| = 3.6 \times 10^{-6} \m = 3.6 \text{ μm} $$
</div>

Alternatively, using $$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = (-5.42)(8.00 \times 10^{-5}) + \frac{1}{2}(1.34 \times 10^{5})(8.00 \times 10^{-5})^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = -4.34 \times 10^{-4} + 4.30 \times 10^{-4} = -4.0 \times 10^{-6} \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ |\Delta y| \approx 4.0 \times 10^{-6} \m = 4.0 \text{ μm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ball hits the floor at 5.42 m/s and rebounds at 5.33 m/s - nearly the same speed, indicating an almost elastic collision. The acceleration during contact is enormous - about 13,700 times the acceleration due to gravity (about 13,700 g's)! Despite this huge acceleration, the ball compresses only about 4 micrometers because the contact time is so brief (0.08 milliseconds). These values are reasonable for a hard steel ball on a hard floor. The small loss in rebound height (from 1.50 m to 1.45 m) represents energy lost to heat and sound during the collision.

**Answer**

(a) The velocity just before striking the floor is $$ 5.42 \ms $$ downward.

(b) The velocity just after leaving the floor is $$ 5.33 \ms $$ upward.

(c) The acceleration during contact with the floor is $$ 1.34 \times 10^{5} \mss $$ (upward, or about 13,700 g's).

(d) The ball compressed approximately $$ 4.0 \times 10^{-6} \m $$ or $$ 4.0 \text{ μm} $$ during its collision with the floor.

A coin is dropped from a hot-air balloon that is 300 m above the ground and rising at 10.0 m/s upward. For the coin, find
(a) the maximum height reached,
(b) its position and velocity 4.00 s after being released, and
(c) the time before it hits the ground.
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The coin is released from a balloon that is already moving upward at 10.0 m/s, so the coin inherits this initial velocity. After release, the coin decelerates, reaches a maximum height, then falls back down. We'll analyze the motion in stages using $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$.

**Solution**

**(a) Maximum height reached:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 300 \m $$ (above ground)
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = +10.0 \ms $$ (upward, same as balloon)
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$
   - Final velocity at max height: $$ v = 0 $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Solve for the maximum height $$ y $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = (10.0)^2 + 2(-9.80)(y - 300) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = 100 - 19.6(y - 300) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 19.6(y - 300) = 100 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y - 300 = \frac{100}{19.6} = 5.10 \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = 305 \m $$
</div>

**(b) Position and velocity at t = 4.00 s:**

1. Position after 4.00 s:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = 300 + (10.0)(4.00) + \frac{1}{2}(-9.80)(4.00)^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = 300 + 40.0 + \frac{1}{2}(-9.80)(16.0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ y = 300 + 40.0 - 78.4 = 262 \m $$
</div>

2. Velocity after 4.00 s:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = v_0 + at $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = 10.0 + (-9.80)(4.00) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = 10.0 - 39.2 = -29.2 \ms $$
</div>

The negative sign indicates the coin is moving downward.

**(c) Time before hitting the ground:**

1. When the coin hits the ground, $$ y = 0 $$. Use:
<div class="equation">

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates motion with an initial upward velocity. The coin doesn't immediately fall - it first continues upward for $$ \frac{v_0}{g} = \frac{10.0}{9.80} = 1.02 \s $$, rising an additional 5.10 m to reach 305 m. At $$ t = 4.00 \s $$, the coin has passed through its maximum height and is falling downward at 29.2 m/s. The total time to hit the ground (8.91 s) is longer than it would be if dropped from rest at 300 m (which would take $$ \sqrt{\frac{2(300)}{9.80}} = 7.82 \s $$) because the initial upward velocity adds extra time. The coin actually falls from a maximum height of 305 m, not 300 m.

**Answer**

(a) The maximum height reached by the coin is 305 m above the ground.

(b) At $$ t = 4.00 \s $$ after release, the coin is at a position of 262 m above the ground and has a velocity of $$ 29.2 \ms $$ downward.

(c) The coin hits the ground 8.91 s after being released from the balloon.

A soft tennis ball is dropped onto a hard floor from a height of 1.50 m and rebounds to a height of 1.10 m.
(a) Calculate its velocity just before it strikes the floor.
(b) Calculate its velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up.

(d) How much did the ball compress during its collision with the floor,
assuming the floor is absolutely rigid?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Take upward as positive. The tennis ball falls from rest, hits the floor, compresses, and rebounds. We'll analyze the motion in stages: before impact, during collision, and after rebound. Note that the longer contact time and lower rebound height indicate a less elastic collision compared to the steel ball. Use $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$ for the acceleration due to gravity.

**Solution**

**(a) Velocity just before striking the floor:**

1. Identify the known values for the downward fall:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 1.50 \m $$
   - Final position: $$ y = 0 $$ (floor level)
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 0 $$ (dropped from rest)
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 0 + 2(-9.80)(0 - 1.50) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = 2(-9.80)(-1.50) = 29.4 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \pm \sqrt{29.4} = \pm 5.42 \ms $$
</div>

Taking the negative root (downward motion):

<div class="equation">
$$ v = -5.42 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Velocity just after leaving the floor:**

1. Identify the known values for the upward rebound:
   - Initial position: $$ y_0 = 0 $$ (floor level)
   - Final position: $$ y = 1.10 \m $$ (maximum rebound height)
   - Final velocity at max height: $$ v = 0 $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = -g = -9.80 \mss $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(y - y_0) $$
</div>

3. Solve for initial velocity after rebound $$ v_0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = v_0^2 + 2(-9.80)(1.10 - 0) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0^2 = 2(9.80)(1.10) = 21.56 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_0 = \sqrt{21.56} = +4.64 \ms $$
</div>

**(c) Acceleration during contact with the floor:**

During the collision, the ball's velocity changes from -5.42 m/s to +4.64 m/s.

1. Identify the known values:
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = -5.42 \ms $$
   - Final velocity: $$ v = +4.64 \ms $$
   - Time of contact: $$ t = 3.50 \times 10^{-3} \s $$

2. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = v_0 + at $$
</div>

3. Solve for acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{v - v_0}{t} = \frac{4.64 - (-5.42)}{3.50 \times 10^{-3}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{10.06}{3.50 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.87 \times 10^{3} \mss $$
</div>

**(d) Distance the ball compressed during collision:**

1. Use the kinematic equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ y = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
</div>

2. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = (-5.42)(3.50 \times 10^{-3}) + \frac{1}{2}(2.87 \times 10^{3})(3.50 \times 10^{-3})^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = -1.90 \times 10^{-2} + \frac{1}{2}(2.87 \times 10^{3})(1.225 \times 10^{-5}) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = -1.90 \times 10^{-2} + 1.76 \times 10^{-2} = -1.4 \times 10^{-3} \m $$
</div>

The magnitude of compression is:

<div class="equation">
$$ |\Delta y| = 1.4 \times 10^{-3} \m = 1.4 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

Alternatively, using average velocity:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = \frac{v_0 + v}{2}t = \frac{-5.42 + 4.64}{2} \times (3.50 \times 10^{-3}) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta y = \frac{-0.78}{2} \times (3.50 \times 10^{-3}) = -1.37 \times 10^{-3} \m $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ |\Delta y| \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-3} \m = 1.4 \text{ mm} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The soft tennis ball shows markedly different behavior from the steel ball. It hits the floor at the same speed (5.42 m/s) since both are dropped from 1.50 m, but rebounds at only 4.64 m/s compared to the steel ball's 5.33 m/s. This represents greater energy loss during the collision. The contact time is much longer (3.50 ms vs. 0.08 ms), resulting in a much smaller acceleration (about 293 g's vs. 13,700 g's for the steel ball). The soft tennis ball compresses about 1.4 mm, which is over 300 times more than the steel ball (4 micrometers). This greater compression and longer contact time are characteristic of softer materials and less elastic collisions. The significant loss in rebound height (from 1.50 m to 1.10 m, a 27% loss) shows that much more energy was dissipated as heat, sound, and permanent deformation compared to the steel ball.

**Answer**

(a) The velocity just before striking the floor is $$ 5.42 \ms $$ downward.

(b) The velocity just after leaving the floor is $$ 4.64 \ms $$ upward.

(c) The acceleration during contact with the floor is $$ 2.87 \times 10^{3} \mss $$ (upward, or about 293 g's).

(d) The ball compressed approximately $$ 1.4 \times 10^{-3} \m $$ or $$ 1.4 \text{ mm} $$ during its collision with the floor.
