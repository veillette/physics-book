In the early 1930s only a small number of subatomic particles were known to
exist—the proton, neutron, electron, photon and, indirectly, the neutrino.
Nature seemed relatively simple in some ways, but mysterious in others. Why, for
example, should the particle that carries positive charge be almost 2000 times
as massive as the one carrying negative charge? Why does a neutral particle like
the neutron have a magnetic moment? Does this imply an internal structure with a
distribution of moving charges? Why is it that the electron seems to have no
size other than its wavelength, while the proton and neutron are about 1 fermi
in size? So, while the number of known particles was small and they explained a
great deal of atomic and nuclear phenomena, there were many unexplained
phenomena and hints of further substructures.

Things soon became more complicated, both in theory and in the prediction and
discovery of new particles. In 1928, the British physicist P.A.M. Dirac (
see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)) developed a highly successful relativistic quantum
theory that laid the foundations of quantum electrodynamics (QED). His theory,
for example, explained electron spin and magnetic moment in a natural way. But
Dirac’s theory also predicted negative energy states for free electrons. By
1931, Dirac, along with Oppenheimer, realized this was a prediction of
positively charged electrons (or positrons). In 1932, American physicist Carl
Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. The positron, or
$${e}^{+} $$ , is the same particle as emitted in $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay and
was the first antimatter that was discovered. In 1935, Yukawa predicted pions as
the carriers of the strong nuclear force, and they were eventually discovered.
Muons were discovered in cosmic ray experiments in 1937, and they seemed to be
heavy, unstable versions of electrons and positrons. After World War II,
accelerators energetic enough to create these particles were built. Not only
were predicted and known particles created, but many unexpected particles were
observed. Initially called elementary particles, their numbers proliferated to
dozens and then hundreds, and the term “particle zoo” became the physicist’s
lament at the lack of simplicity. But patterns were observed in the particle zoo
that led to simplifying ideas such as quarks, as we shall soon see.

### Matter and Antimatter

The positron was only the first example of antimatter. Every particle in nature
has an antimatter counterpart, although some particles, like the photon, are
their own antiparticles. Antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for
example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly
identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on.
When a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one
another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of
photons as seen in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Neutral particles, such as neutrons,
have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact.
Certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live correspondingly
short lives. For example, the neutral pion $${\pi }^{0} $$ is its own
antiparticle and has a half-life about $$10^{-8} $$ shorter than $${\pi }^{+} $$
and $${\pi }^{-} $$ , which are each other’s antiparticles. Without exception,
nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. For example,
antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in
1956 and the antiproton is negative. Antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an
antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at CERN, too. It is possible
to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using
electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that
they don\'t annihilate with other particles. However, particles of the same
charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the
more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. It is not
currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. At any rate,
we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and
high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. But
this knowledge does raise another question—why is there such a predominance of
matter and so little antimatter? Possible explanations emerge later in this and
the next chapter.

### Hadrons and Leptons

Particles can also be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel
between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by
gravity, since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All
charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral
particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with
its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong
and weak nuclear forces. **Hadrons** are particles that feel the strong nuclear
force, whereas **leptons** are particles that do not. The proton, neutron, and
the pions are examples of hadrons. The electron, positron, muons, and neutrinos
are examples of leptons, the name meaning low mass. Leptons feel the weak
nuclear force. In fact, all particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means
that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak
nuclear forces.

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists the characteristics of some of the most important
subatomic particles, including the directly observed carrier particles for the
electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, all leptons, and some hadrons. Several
hints related to an underlying substructure emerge from an examination of these
particle characteristics. Note that the carrier particles are called **gauge
bosons**. First mentioned
in [Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization](../contents/ch30PatternsInSpectraRevealMoreQuantization), a **boson** is a
particle with zero or an integer value of intrinsic spin (such as $$s=0, 1, 2, ... $$ ), whereas a **fermion** is a particle with a half-integer value of
intrinsic spin ( $$s=1/2, 3/2, \text{...} $$ ). Fermions obey the Pauli
exclusion principle whereas bosons do not. All the known and conjectured carrier
particles are bosons.

The lower image shows a starburst image from which two photons are emerging in opposite directions.](../resources/Figure_33_04_02.jpg 'When a particle encounters its antiparticle, they annihilate, often producing pure energy in the form of photons. In this case, an electron and a positron convert all their mass into two identical energy rays, which move away in opposite directions to keep total momentum zero as it was before. Similar annihilations occur for other combinations of a particle with its antiparticle, sometimes producing more particles while obeying all conservation laws.')

All known leptons are listed in the table given above. There are only six
leptons (and their antiparticles), and they seem to be fundamental in that they
have no apparent underlying structure. Leptons have no discernible size other
than their wavelength, so that we know they are pointlike down to about $$ 10^{-18} \text{m} $$ . The leptons fall into three families, implying three
conservation laws for three quantum numbers. One of these was known from $$\beta $$

decay, where the existence of the electron’s neutrino implied that a new
quantum number, called
the <strong class="term" >electron family
number </strong> $${L}_{e} $$ is conserved. Thus, in $$\beta $$ decay, an
antielectron’s neutrino $${\stackrel{-}{\nu}}_{e} $$ must be created with $${L}_{e}=-1 $$ when an electron with $${L}_{e}=+1 $$ is created, so that the total
remains 0 as it was before decay.

Once the muon was discovered in cosmic rays, its decay mode was found to be

<div class="equation" >
 $${\mu }^{-}\to {e}^{-}+{\stackrel{-}{v}}_{e}+{\nu}_{\mu}\text{,} $$
</div>

which implied another “family” and associated conservation principle. The
particle $${\nu}_{\mu } $$ is a muon’s neutrino, and it is created to
conserve **muon family number** $${L}_{\mu } $$ . So muons are leptons with a
family of their own, and **conservation of total $${L}_{\mu } $$
** also seems to be obeyed in many experiments.

More recently, a third lepton family was discovered when $$\tau $$ particles
were created and observed to decay in a manner similar to muons. One principal
decay mode is

<div class="equation" >
 $${\tau }^{-}\to {\mu }^{-}+{\stackrel{-}{v}}_{\mu }+{v}_{\tau }\text{.} $$
</div>

<strong class="term">Conservation of total </strong>  $${L}_{\tau } $$ seems to
be another law obeyed in many experiments. In fact, particle experiments have
found that lepton family number is not universally conserved, due to neutrino
“oscillations,” or transformations of neutrinos from one family type to another.

### Mesons and Baryons

Now, note that the hadrons in the table given above are divided into two
subgroups, called mesons (originally for medium mass) and baryons (the name
originally meaning large mass). The division between mesons and baryons is
actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with
their masses. **Mesons** are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no
hadrons, which implies that mesons are not conserved in number. **Baryons** are
hadrons that always decay to another baryon. A new physical quantity called **baryon number**  $$B $$ seems to always be conserved in nature and is listed for
the various particles in the table given above. Mesons and leptons have $$B=0 $$
so that they can decay to other particles with $$B=0 $$ . But baryons have
$$B=+1 $$ if they are matter, and $$B=-1 $$ if they are antimatter. The **conservation of total baryon number** is a more general rule than first noted in
nuclear physics, where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was
always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays. That rule in nuclear physics
is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number.

### Forces, Reactions, and Reaction Rates

The forces that act between particles regulate how they interact with other
particles. For example, pions feel the strong force and do not penetrate as far
in matter as do muons, which do not feel the strong force. (This was the way
those who discovered the muon knew it could not be the particle that carries the
strong force—its penetration or range was too great for it to be feeling the
strong force.) Similarly, reactions that create other particles, like cosmic
rays interacting with nuclei in the atmosphere, have greater probability if they
are caused by the strong force than if they are caused by the weak force. Such
knowledge has been useful to physicists while analyzing the particles produced
by various accelerators.

The forces experienced by particles also govern how particles interact with
themselves if they are unstable and decay. For example, the stronger the force,
the faster they decay and the shorter is their lifetime. An example of a nuclear
decay via the strong force is $${ }^{8}\text{Be}\to \alpha +\alpha $$ with a
lifetime of about $$ 10^{-16} \text{s} $$ . The neutron is a good example of
decay via the weak force. The process $$n\to p+{e}^{-}+{\stackrel{-}{v}}_{e} $$
has a longer lifetime of 882 s. The weak force causes this decay, as it does all
$$\beta $$ decay. An important clue that the weak force is responsible for
$$\beta $$ decay is the creation of leptons, such as $${e}^{-} $$ and
$${\stackrel{-}{v}}_{e} $$ . None would be created if the strong force was
responsible, just as no leptons are created in the decay of $${ }^{8}\text{Be} $$ . The systematics of particle lifetimes is a little simpler than nuclear
lifetimes when hundreds of particles are examined (not just the ones in the
table given above). Particles that decay via the weak force have lifetimes
mostly in the range of $$ 10^{-16} $$ to $$ 10^{-12} $$ s, whereas those that
decay via the strong force have lifetimes mostly in the range of $$ 10^{-16} $$
to $$ 10^{-23} $$ s. Turning this around, if we measure the lifetime of a
particle, we can tell if it decays via the weak or strong force.

Yet another quantum number emerges from decay lifetimes and patterns. Note that
the particles $$\text{Λ}\text{,} \text{Σ}\text{,} \text{Ξ} $$ , and $$\Omega $$
decay with lifetimes on the order of $$ 10^{-10} $$ s (the exception is
$${\text{Σ}}^{0} $$ , whose short lifetime is explained by its particular quark
substructure.), implying that their decay is caused by the weak force alone,
although they are hadrons and feel the strong force. The decay modes of these
particles also show patterns—in particular, certain decays that should be
possible within all the known conservation laws do not occur. Whenever something
is possible in physics, it will happen. If something does not happen, it is
forbidden by a rule. All this seemed strange to those studying these particles
when they were first discovered, so they named a new quantum number **strangeness**, given the symbol $$S $$ in the table given above. The values of
strangeness assigned to various particles are based on the decay systematics. It
is found that **strangeness is conserved by the strong force**, which governs
the production of most of these particles in accelerator experiments.
However, **strangeness is *not conserved* by the weak force**. This conclusion
is reached from the fact that particles that have long lifetimes decay via the
weak force and do not conserve strangeness. All of this also has implications
for the carrier particles, since they transmit forces and are thus involved in
these decays.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Quantum Numbers in Two Decays
</div>
(a) The most common decay mode of the  $${\text{Ξ}}^{-} $$
 particle is  $${\text{Ξ}}^{-}\to {\text{Λ}}^{0}+{\pi }^{-} $$ .
 Using the quantum numbers in the table given above, show that strangeness changes by 1, baryon number and charge are conserved, and lepton family numbers are unaffected.

(b) Is the decay $${K}^{+}\to {\mu }^{+}+{\nu }_{\mu } $$ allowed, given the
quantum numbers in the table given above?

**Strategy**

In part (a), the conservation laws can be examined by adding the quantum numbers
of the decay products and comparing them with the parent particle. In part (b),
the same procedure can reveal if a conservation law is broken or not.

**Solution for (a)**

Before the decay, the $${\text{Ξ}}^{-} $$ has strangeness $$S=-2 $$ . After the
decay, the total strangeness is –1 for the $${\text{Λ}}^{0} $$ , plus 0 for the
$${\pi }^{-} $$ . Thus, total strangeness has gone from –2 to –1 or a change of
+1. Baryon number for the $${\text{Ξ}}^{-} $$ is $$B=+1 $$ before the decay, and
after the decay the $${\text{Λ}}^{0} $$ has $$B=+1 $$ and the $${\pi }^{-} $$
has $$B=0 $$ so that the total baryon number remains +1. Charge is –1 before the
decay, and the total charge after is also $$0-1=-1 $$ . Lepton numbers for all
the particles are zero, and so lepton numbers are conserved.

**Discussion for (a)**

The $${\text{Ξ}}^{-} $$ decay is caused by the weak interaction, since
strangeness changes, and it is consistent with the relatively long $$ 1.64 \times 10^{-10} \text{-s} $$ lifetime of the $${\text{Ξ}}^{-} $$.

**Solution for (b)**

The decay $${K}^{+}\to {\mu }^{+}+{\nu }_{\mu } $$ is allowed if charge, baryon
number, mass-energy, and lepton numbers are conserved. Strangeness can change
due to the weak interaction. Charge is conserved as $$s\to d $$ . Baryon number
is conserved, since all particles have $$B=0 $$
<em>. </em> Mass-energy is conserved in the sense that the $${K}^{+} $$ has a
greater mass than the products, so that the decay can be spontaneous. Lepton
family numbers are conserved at 0 for the electron and tau family for all
particles. The muon family number is $${L}_{\mu }=0 $$ before and $${L}_{\mu }=-1+1=0 $$ after. Strangeness changes from +1 before to 0 + 0 after, for an
allowed change of 1. The decay is allowed by all these measures.

**Discussion for (b)**

This decay is not only allowed by our reckoning, it is, in fact, the primary
decay mode of the $${K}^{+} $$ meson and is caused by the weak force, consistent
with the long $$ 1.24 \times 10^{-8} \text{-s} $$ lifetime.

</div>

There are hundreds of particles, all hadrons, not listed in [[Table 1]](#Table1)
, most of which have shorter lifetimes. The systematics of those particle
lifetimes, their production probabilities, and decay products are completely
consistent with the conservation laws noted for lepton families, baryon number,
and strangeness, but they also imply other quantum numbers and conservation
laws. There are a finite, and in fact relatively small, number of these
conserved quantities, however, implying a finite set of substructures.
Additionally, some of these short-lived particles resemble the excited states of
other particles, implying an internal structure. All of this jigsaw puzzle can
be tied together and explained relatively simply by the existence of fundamental
substructures. Leptons seem to be fundamental structures. Hadrons seem to have a
substructure called quarks. [Quarks: Is That All There Is?](../contents/ch33Quarks) explores
the basics of the underlying quark building blocks.

![The image shows a picture of physicist Murray Gell Mann, who looks like a pleasant white-haired gentleman.](../resources/Figure_33_04_03.jpg "Murray Gell-Mann (b. 1929) proposed quarks as a substructure of hadrons in 1963 and was already known for his work on the concept of strangeness. Although quarks have never been directly observed, several predictions of the quark model were quickly confirmed, and their properties explain all known hadron characteristics. Gell-Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1969. (credit: Lubo&#x161; Motl)")

### Summary

* All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite
  charge and certain other quantum numbers as seen in [[Table 1]](#Table1).
  These matter-antimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate
  when brought together. Known particles can be divided into three major
  groups—leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons).
* Leptons do not feel the strong nuclear force and are further divided into
  three groups—electron family designated by electron family number $${L}_{e} $$
  ; muon family designated by muon family number $${L}_{\mu } $$ ; and tau
  family designated by tau family number $${L}_{\tau } $$ . The family numbers
  are not universally conserved due to neutrino oscillations.
* Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force and are divided into
  baryons, with the baryon family number
  $$B $$ being conserved, and mesons.

 What is the energy release in MeV in this decay?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy released in a decay is the difference between the initial mass energy and the final mass energies. From the particle tables, we need the masses of the $${\pi}^{-}$$ and $${\mu}^{-}$$. The muon antineutrino $${\stackrel{-}{\nu}}_{\mu}$$ is essentially massless. Using [[Table 1]](#Table1), the $${\pi}^{-}$$ has a mass of 139.6 MeV/$$c^2$$ and the $${\mu}^{-}$$ has a mass of 105.7 MeV/$$c^2$$.

**Solution**

The energy release is:

<div class="equation">
$$Q = (m_{\pi^{-}} - m_{\mu^{-}} - m_{\overline{\nu}_{\mu}}) c^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$Q = (139.6 - 105.7 - 0) \text{ MeV} = 33.9 \text{ MeV}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The decay releases 33.9 MeV of energy, which is shared between the kinetic energy of the muon and the energy carried away by the massless muon antineutrino. This represents about 24% of the pion's rest mass energy being converted into kinetic energy of the decay products. The fact that this decay is energetically favorable (positive Q-value) means it can occur spontaneously. This is the dominant decay mode of the $${\pi}^{-}$$, occurring about 99.99% of the time. The energy is shared unequally between the products due to momentum conservation—since the neutrino is massless and the muon is massive, the neutrino carries away most of the energy while the muon carries most of the momentum. The muon itself is unstable and will subsequently decay via $${\mu}^{-} \to e^{-} + \overline{\nu}_e + \nu_{\mu}$$, but with a much longer lifetime ($$2.20 \times 10^{-6}$$ s compared to the pion's $$2.60 \times 10^{-8}$$ s).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we need to find the mass difference between the initial and final particles. The muon mass is 105.7 MeV/$$c^2$$ and the electron mass is 0.511 MeV/$$c^2$$. Both neutrinos are essentially massless. For part (b), we check conservation of charge and the three lepton family numbers ($$L_e$$, $$L_{\mu}$$, $$L_{\tau}$$).

**Solution**

(a) The energy released is:

<div class="equation">
$$Q = (m_{\mu^{-}} - m_{e^{-}} - m_{\overline{\nu}_e} - m_{\nu_{\mu}}) c^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$Q = (105.7 - 0.511 - 0 - 0) \text{ MeV} = 105.2 \text{ MeV}$$

(b) **Charge conservation:**
- Before: $$Q = -1$$ (from $${\mu}^{-}$$)
- After: $$Q = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1$$ (from $$e^{-}$$, $$\overline{\nu}_e$$, $$\nu_{\mu}$$)
- Charge is conserved: $$-1 = -1$$ ✓

**Electron family number ($$L_e$$):**
- Before: $$L_e = 0$$ (muon is not in electron family)
- After: $$L_e = +1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$ (from $$e^{-}$$, $$\overline{\nu}_e$$, $$\nu_{\mu}$$)
- Electron family number is conserved: $$0 = 0$$ ✓

**Muon family number ($$L_{\mu}$$):**
- Before: $$L_{\mu} = +1$$ (from $${\mu}^{-}$$)
- After: $$L_{\mu} = 0 + 0 + 1 = +1$$ (from $$e^{-}$$, $$\overline{\nu}_e$$, $$\nu_{\mu}$$)
- Muon family number is conserved: $$+1 = +1$$ ✓

**Tau family number ($$L_{\tau}$$):**
- Before and after: $$L_{\tau} = 0$$ (no tau particles involved)
- Tau family number is conserved: $$0 = 0$$ ✓

**Discussion**

Nearly all of the muon's rest mass energy (105.2 out of 105.7 MeV, or 99.5%) is released in this decay, shared among the three decay products. The electron receives some kinetic energy, while the two neutrinos carry away the rest. This decay demonstrates the weak force in action—the creation of leptons and the relatively long lifetime ($$2.20 \times 10^{-6}$$ s) are characteristic of weak interactions. The conservation of lepton family numbers is a fundamental principle: the electron antineutrino is created to balance the electron family number when an electron is created, and the muon neutrino preserves the muon family number from the original muon. This decay mode has been studied extensively and provides precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the masses from [[Table 1]](#Table1): $${\Sigma}^{0}$$ has mass 1192.6 MeV/$$c^2$$ and $${\Lambda}^{0}$$ has mass 1115.7 MeV/$$c^2$$. For parts (b)-(d), we examine quark structure, conservation laws, and force characteristics.

**Solution**

(a) The energy released is the mass difference:

<div class="equation">
$$Q = (m_{\Sigma^{0}} - m_{\Lambda^{0}} - m_{\gamma}) c^2 = (1192.6 - 1115.7 - 0) \text{ MeV} = 76.9 \text{ MeV}$$
</div>

(b) From quark tables, both $${\Sigma}^{0}$$ and $${\Lambda}^{0}$$ have the quark composition _uds_ (one up, one down, one strange quark). Since they have identical quark content but different masses and spins, **yes, the $${\Sigma}^{0}$$ appears to be an excited state of the $${\Lambda}^{0}$$**. The extra 76.9 MeV represents the excitation energy.

(c) **Conservation checks:**
- **Strangeness:** $$S = -1$$ before ($${\Sigma}^{0}$$), $$S = -1 + 0 = -1$$ after ($${\Lambda}^{0} + \gamma$$) ✓
- **Charge:** $$Q = 0$$ before, $$Q = 0 + 0 = 0$$ after ✓
- **Baryon number:** $$B = +1$$ before, $$B = +1 + 0 = +1$$ after ✓

All three quantum numbers are conserved.

(d) **No, the weak force cannot be responsible** for this decay. The evidence:
1. **Strangeness is conserved**, which indicates the strong or electromagnetic force (the weak force violates strangeness conservation)
2. **The lifetime is extremely short** ($$7.4 \times 10^{-20}$$ s), characteristic of electromagnetic decay, not weak decay which typically has lifetimes of $$10^{-10}$$ s or longer
3. **A photon is emitted**, which is characteristic of an electromagnetic transition

This is an electromagnetic decay of an excited baryon state, analogous to an atomic electron transitioning to a lower energy level and emitting a photon.

**Discussion**

This decay is a beautiful example of how particle physics mirrors atomic physics. Just as atoms have excited states that decay by photon emission, baryons can also exist in excited states. The $${\Sigma}^{0}$$ is essentially a $${\Lambda}^{0}$$ with its quarks in an excited configuration—perhaps with different relative spins or orbital angular momenta. The electromagnetic force mediates the transition, conserving strangeness (unlike weak decays), and the process is very rapid (unlike weak decays). The photon carries away the 76.9 MeV excitation energy. After this electromagnetic decay, the $${\Lambda}^{0}$$ itself will eventually decay via the weak force (which can change strangeness) with its much longer lifetime of $$2.63 \times 10^{-10}$$ s.

(b) Is the uncertainty in this energy greater than or less than the uncertainty

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle $$\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$ with the lifetime of the tau from [[Table 1]](#Table1): $$\tau = 2.91 \times 10^{-13}$$ s. For part (b), we compare this energy uncertainty to the experimental upper limit on the tau neutrino mass.

**Solution**

(a) Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta E \approx \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta t} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{4\pi (2.91 \times 10^{-13} \text{ s})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta E \approx \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}{3.66 \times 10^{-12}} \text{ J} = 1.81 \times 10^{-22} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Converting to eV:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta E = \frac{1.81 \times 10^{-22} \text{ J}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \approx 1.1 \text{ meV}$$
</div>

(b) From [[Table 1]](#Table1), the experimental upper limit on the tau neutrino mass is less than 31 MeV/$$c^2$$ = 31,000,000 eV. The uncertainty in the tau decay energy ($$\sim 1.1 \times 10^{-3}$$ eV) is **vastly smaller** than the uncertainty in the neutrino mass.

The ratio is:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta E_{\tau}}{\Delta m_{\nu_{\tau}}c^2} = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV}}{3.1 \times 10^{7} \text{ eV}} \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-11}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The energy uncertainty from the tau's finite lifetime is about 1.1 millielectronvolts (meV), which is incredibly small—ten billion times smaller than the upper limit on the tau neutrino mass. This demonstrates two different sources of uncertainty:

1. **Quantum uncertainty from finite lifetime**: The tau's lifetime of $$2.91 \times 10^{-13}$$ s leads to an intrinsic energy uncertainty via the Heisenberg principle. This is a fundamental quantum mechanical effect—short-lived particles have broader energy distributions.

2. **Experimental uncertainty in neutrino mass**: The much larger uncertainty in the neutrino mass (< 31 MeV) comes from experimental limitations in measuring such tiny masses. Neutrinos interact so weakly that determining their masses precisely is extremely challenging.

The fact that the lifetime-induced uncertainty is negligible compared to the neutrino mass uncertainty means that the tau's finite lifetime doesn't significantly hamper our ability to measure the neutrino mass—the limitation is purely experimental. Recent experiments suggest the tau neutrino mass is actually much smaller than 31 MeV, possibly even zero like its counterparts, but this remains an area of active research.
