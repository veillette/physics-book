* Outline the invention of a telescope.

</div>

Telescopes are meant for viewing distant objects, producing an image that is
larger than the image that can be seen with the unaided eye. Telescopes gather
far more light than the eye, allowing dim objects to be observed with greater
magnification and better resolution. Although Galileo is often credited with
inventing the telescope, he actually did not. What he did was more important. He
constructed several early telescopes, was the first to study the heavens with
them, and made monumental discoveries using them. Among these are the moons of
Jupiter, the craters and mountains on the Moon, the details of sunspots, and the
fact that the Milky Way is composed of vast numbers of individual stars.

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(a) shows a telescope made of two lenses, the convex
objective and the concave eyepiece, the same construction used by Galileo. Such
an arrangement produces an upright image and is used in spyglasses and opera
glasses.

![Part a of the figure depicts the internal functioning of a telescope; from left to right it has an upright image of a tree, a convex lens objective, a concave lens eyepiece, and a picture of eye where rays enter. Parallel rays strike the objective convex lens, converge; strike the concave eyepiece, and enter the eye. Dotted lines from the striking rays of the eyepiece are drawn backside and join at the beginning of the final image. Part b of the figure, from left to right, has an inverted enlarged image of a tree, a convex objective, a smaller inverted image of a tree, a convex eyepiece and a picture of an eye viewing the image. Rays from a very distant object pass through the objective lens, focus at a focal point f sub o, forming a smaller upside-down image of a tree of height h sub i, converge and pass through the eyepiece to reach the eye. Dotted lines drawn backwards focus at the tip of the final enlarged inverted image of a tree of height h prime sub i, from the rays striking the eyepiece are also shown. An angle theta, subtended by the rays striking the objective lens and an angle, subtended by the telescopic enlarged inverted image are also depicted.](../resources/Figure_26_05_01.jpg '(a) Galileo made telescopes with a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. These produce an upright image and are used in spyglasses. (b) Most simple telescopes have two convex lenses. The objective forms a case 1 image that is the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified.')
{: #Figure1}

The most common two-lens telescope, like the simple microscope, uses two convex
lenses and is shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(b). The object is so far away from
the telescope that it is essentially at infinity compared with the focal lengths
of the lenses ( $${d}_{\text{o}}\approx \infty $$ ). The first image is thus
produced at $${d}_{\text{i}}={f}_{\text{o}} $$ , as shown in the figure. To
prove this, note that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{ {f}_{\text{o}}}-\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{o}}}=\frac{1}{ {f}_{\text{o}}}-\frac{1}{\infty }\text{.} $$
</div>

Because $$1/\infty =0 $$ , this simplifies to

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{ {d}_{\text{i}}}=\frac{1}{ {f}_{\text{o}}}\text{,} $$
</div>

which implies that $${d}_{\text{i}}={f}_{\text{o}} $$ , as claimed. It is true
that for any distant object and any lens or mirror, the image is at the focal
length.

The first image formed by a telescope objective as seen
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(b) will not be large compared with what you might see
by looking at the object directly. For example, the spot formed by sunlight
focused on a piece of paper by a magnifying glass is the image of the Sun, and
it is small. The telescope eyepiece (like the microscope eyepiece) magnifies
this first image. The distance between the eyepiece and the objective lens is
made slightly less than the sum of their focal lengths so that the first image
is closer to the eyepiece than its focal length. That is, $${d}^\prime_ {\text{o}} $$ is less than $${f}_{\text{e}} $$ , and so the eyepiece forms a
case 2 image that is large and to the left for easy viewing. If the angle
subtended by an object as viewed by the unaided eye is $$\theta $$ , and the
angle subtended by the telescope image is $$\theta^{\prime} $$ , then the **angular magnification**  $$M $$ is defined to be their ratio. That is,
$$M=\theta^{\prime} /\theta $$ . It can be shown that the angular magnification
of a telescope is related to the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece;
and is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$M=\frac{\theta^{\prime} }{\theta }=-\frac{ {f}_{\text{o}}}{ {f}_{\text{e}}}\text{.} $$
</div>

The minus sign indicates the image is inverted. To obtain the greatest angular
magnification, it is best to have a long focal length objective and a short
focal length eyepiece. The greater the angular magnification $$M $$ , the larger
an object will appear when viewed through a telescope, making more details
visible. Limits to observable details are imposed by many factors, including
lens quality and atmospheric disturbance.

The image in most telescopes is inverted, which is unimportant for observing the
stars but a real problem for other applications, such as telescopes on ships or
telescopic gun sights. If an upright image is needed, Galileo’s arrangement
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(a) can be used. But a more common arrangement is to
use a third convex lens as an eyepiece, increasing the distance between the
first two and inverting the image once again as seen in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).

![A ray diagram from left to right depicts a concave objective lens, a small inverted image of a tree, a magnified upright final image of tree, an erecting concave lens, a small upright image of a tree, concave lens as an eyepiece, and an eye to view on the same optical axis. Rays from a distant object strike the edges of the objective lens, converge at the focus of the focal point, form a small inverted image of the object and pass through the erecting lens, again forming the upright small image of the object, and finally, the rays pass through the eyepiece to the eye. Dotted lines joined backwards from the rays striking the eyepiece meet at a point where the final enlarged upright image of the object is formed.](../resources/Figure_26_05_02.jpg 'This arrangement of three lenses in a telescope produces an upright final image. The first two lenses are far enough apart that the second lens inverts the image of the first one more time. The third lens acts as a magnifier and keeps the image upright and in a location that is easy to view.')
{: #Figure2}

A telescope can also be made with a concave mirror as its first element or
objective, since a concave mirror acts like a convex lens as seen
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Flat mirrors are often employed in optical
instruments to make them more compact or to send light to cameras and other
sensing devices. There are many advantages to using mirrors rather than lenses
for telescope objectives. Mirrors can be constructed much larger than lenses and
can, thus, gather large amounts of light, as needed to view distant galaxies,
for example. Large and relatively flat mirrors have very long focal lengths, so
that great angular magnification is possible.

![A ray diagram from left to right depicts a small diagonal mirror and a concave lens eyepiece placed parallel to each other. A large curved objective mirror is placed in front of the diagonal mirror. Parallel rays of light are falling at the edges of the objective mirror, which is curved just at the right amount to bounce all the light onto the diagonal mirror. From there, the light rays pass through the eyepiece lens, which bends the light into the eye.](../resources/Figure_26_05_03.jpg 'A two-element telescope composed of a mirror as the objective and a lens for the eyepiece is shown. This telescope forms an image in the same manner as the two-convex-lens telescope already discussed, but it does not suffer from chromatic aberrations. Such telescopes can gather more light, since larger mirrors than lenses can be constructed.')

Telescopes, like microscopes, can utilize a range of frequencies from the
electromagnetic spectrum. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)(a) shows the Australia
Telescope Compact Array, which uses six 22-m antennas for mapping the southern
skies using radio waves. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)(b) shows the focusing of X-rays
on the Chandra X-ray Observatory—a satellite orbiting earth since 1999 and
looking at high temperature events as exploding stars, quasars, and black holes.
X-rays, with much more energy and shorter wavelengths than RF and light, are
mainly absorbed and not reflected when incident perpendicular to the medium. But
they can be reflected when incident at small glancing angles, much like a rock
will skip on a lake if thrown at a small angle. The mirrors for the Chandra
consist of a long barrelled pathway and 4 pairs of mirrors to focus the rays at
a point 10 meters away from the entrance. The mirrors are extremely smooth and
consist of a glass ceramic base with a thin coating of metal (iridium). Four
pairs of precision manufactured mirrors are exquisitely shaped and aligned so
that X-rays ricochet off the mirrors like bullets off a wall, focusing on a
spot.

A current exciting development is a collaborative effort involving 17 countries
to construct a Square Kilometre Array (SKA) of telescopes capable of covering
from 80 MHz to 2 GHz. The initial stage of the project is the construction of
the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder in Western Australia (
see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)). The project will use cutting-edge technologies such
as **adaptive optics** in which the lens or mirror is constructed from lots of
carefully aligned tiny lenses and mirrors that can be manipulated using
computers. A range of rapidly changing distortions can be minimized by deforming
or tilting the tiny lenses and mirrors. The use of adaptive optics in vision
correction is a current area of research.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If you want your microscope or telescope to project a real image onto a screen, how would you change the placement of the eyepiece relative to the objective?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To project a real image onto a screen, we need to understand the current configuration of microscopes and telescopes versus what's required for projection. In normal viewing, the eyepiece creates a virtual image for comfortable observation. For projection, we need the final image to be real (not virtual), which requires changing how the eyepiece processes the intermediate image from the objective.

**Solution**

In standard microscope and telescope configurations designed for direct viewing:

**Normal Configuration:**
- The **objective** forms a real intermediate image (case 1 image)
- The **eyepiece** is positioned so the intermediate image falls between the eyepiece and its focal point ($$d_o < f_e$$)
- This creates a **virtual final image** (case 2 image) that appears magnified and is viewed by the eye
- The virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen

**To Project a Real Image:**

You need to **move the eyepiece farther from the objective** so that the intermediate image falls beyond the eyepiece's focal point. Specifically:

**Modified Configuration:**
- Keep the objective in the same position (it still forms a real intermediate image)
- **Increase the distance** between the objective and eyepiece
- Position the eyepiece so that the intermediate image is **beyond the focal point** of the eyepiece ($$d_o > f_e$$)
- Now the eyepiece acts as a **projection lens**, forming a **real final image** (case 1 image)
- This real image can be projected onto a screen placed beyond the eyepiece

**Mathematical Analysis:**

For a microscope, the normal tube length places the intermediate image at distance $$d_o$$ from the eyepiece where $$d_o < f_e$$:

Normal viewing: $$d_o < f_e$$ → produces virtual image at $$d_i < 0$$ (case 2)

For projection: $$d_o > f_e$$ → produces real image at $$d_i > 0$$ (case 1)

Using the thin lens equation:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{f_e} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
</div>

When $$d_o > f_e$$:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f_e} - \frac{1}{d_o} > 0$$
</div>

This gives a positive $$d_i$$, indicating a real image on the opposite side of the eyepiece.

**Practical Implementation:**

**For a Microscope:**
1. The normal tube length is typically 160 mm (older standard) or 200 mm (modern infinity-corrected systems)
2. To project, extend the tube length significantly beyond this
3. The intermediate image moves farther from the objective and thus farther from the eyepiece
4. If the eyepiece has $$f_e = 25$$ mm, position the intermediate image at, say, $$d_o = 30$$ mm from the eyepiece
5. The screen is then placed at $$d_i = \frac{f_e \cdot d_o}{d_o - f_e} = \frac{25 \times 30}{30 - 25} = 150$$ mm beyond the eyepiece

**For a Telescope:**
1. Normally, the objective and eyepiece are separated by approximately $$f_o + f_e$$
2. To project, increase separation to more than $$f_o + f_e$$
3. The intermediate image (normally at $$f_o$$) now serves as an object beyond $$f_e$$ from the eyepiece
4. Place a screen to capture the real projected image

**Alternative: Remove the Eyepiece**

For both instruments, another approach is to:
- **Remove the eyepiece entirely**
- Use the real intermediate image formed by the objective
- This image is already real and can be projected directly onto a screen
- However, the magnification is limited to that of the objective alone
- This is common in photomicrography and astrophotography when high eyepiece magnification isn't needed

**Discussion**

The key conceptual distinction is between **visual observation** and **projection**:

**Visual Observation (Normal Use):**
- Requires a virtual image at optical infinity or at the viewer's near point
- The eye's lens can focus this virtual image onto the retina
- More comfortable for extended viewing (relaxed eye accommodation)
- Eyepiece positioned with $$d_o < f_e$$

**Projection:**
- Requires a real image that physically exists in space
- Light rays must converge to form the image on a screen
- Eyepiece repositioned with $$d_o > f_e$$
- Also called "projection mode" or "camera mode"

**Historical and Practical Applications:**

1. **Photomicrography**: Early microscope photography required extending the tube and projecting the image onto a photographic plate

2. **Astronomical photography**: Before digital cameras, telescopes projected images onto film, requiring the configuration described above

3. **Educational demonstrations**: Projection microscopes and telescopes display images to groups, requiring real image projection

4. **Modern digital imaging**: Digital cameras mounted on microscopes and telescopes still use this principle—the sensor is placed where a real image forms

**Trade-offs:**

- **Increased working distance**: Moving the eyepiece farther requires a longer instrument
- **Different magnification**: The projection magnification differs from visual magnification
- **Brightness considerations**: Projected images may be dimmer and require more light or longer exposure times
- **Focus adjustment**: Requires refocusing compared to visual observation

The fundamental principle applies to both microscopes and telescopes because both instruments work on the same optical principles: an objective creates a real intermediate image, and an eyepiece processes that image. Changing from a virtual final image (for viewing) to a real final image (for projection) simply requires repositioning the eyepiece relative to the intermediate image so it operates in case 1 rather than case 2 configuration.

### Problem Exercises

**Unless otherwise stated, the lens-to-retina distance is 2.00 cm.**

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the angular magnification of a telescope that has a 100 cm focal length objective and a 2.50 cm focal length eyepiece?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The angular magnification of a telescope is given by $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$, where $$f_o$$ is the objective focal length and $$f_e$$ is the eyepiece focal length. The negative sign indicates an inverted final image, which is typical for astronomical telescopes.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Objective focal length: $$f_o = 100 \text{ cm}$$
- Eyepiece focal length: $$f_e = 2.50 \text{ cm}$$

Using the angular magnification formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} = -\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{2.50 \text{ cm}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$M = -40.0$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The telescope has an angular magnification of -40.0, meaning objects appear 40 times larger (in angular size) than when viewed with the naked eye. The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, which is standard for simple two-lens astronomical telescopes (Keplerian design).

This is a substantial magnification suitable for serious amateur astronomy. With 40× magnification:
- The Moon appears 40 times larger in diameter (filling much of the field of view)
- Jupiter's cloud bands become clearly visible
- Saturn's rings are easily resolved
- Many deep-sky objects (nebulae, galaxies) become observable

The combination of a long focal length objective (100 cm) and short focal length eyepiece (2.50 cm) is what produces this high magnification. The 100 cm focal length makes this a reasonably long telescope (over 1 meter tube length), but still portable for amateur use.

For terrestrial viewing where an upright image is desired, a third lens (erecting lens) would need to be added to reinvert the image. However, for astronomical observations, the inverted image is not a concern since there's no inherent "up" or "down" in space. Professional astronomers routinely work with inverted images.

This magnification represents a good balance: high enough for detailed observation but not so high that atmospheric turbulence ("seeing") significantly degrades the image quality. Beyond about 50-60× magnification, atmospheric effects often limit what can be seen, regardless of the telescope's optical quality.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Find the distance between the objective and eyepiece lenses in the telescope in the above problem needed to produce a final image very far from the observer, where vision is most relaxed. Note that a telescope is normally used to view very distant objects.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a telescope viewing distant objects (at infinity) with a relaxed eye (image at infinity), the intermediate image formed by the objective must be at the focal point of the eyepiece. From the previous problem, we have $$f_o = 100$$ cm and $$f_e = 2.50$$ cm. The distance between the lenses is the sum of the two focal lengths.

**Solution**

Given values from the previous problem:
- Objective focal length: $$f_o = 100 \text{ cm}$$
- Eyepiece focal length: $$f_e = 2.50 \text{ cm}$$

For distant objects, the objective forms an image at its focal point ($$d_i = f_o$$). For the final image to be at infinity (relaxed viewing), the intermediate image must be at the focal point of the eyepiece ($$d'_o = f_e$$).

The distance between the lenses:

<div class="equation">
 $$L = f_o + f_e = 100 \text{ cm} + 2.50 \text{ cm} = 102.5 \text{ cm} = 1.025 \text{ m}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The lenses should be separated by 102.5 cm (just over 1 meter) for comfortable viewing of distant objects. This configuration allows the telescope to function with both the object and final image at infinity, which is the standard arrangement for astronomical telescopes. When the object is at infinity, the objective creates an intermediate image at its focal point. By placing the eyepiece such that this intermediate image falls at the eyepiece's focal point, the final image is also projected to infinity, allowing the viewer's eye to remain relaxed.

This is why the tube length of a simple refracting telescope approximately equals the sum of the focal lengths of its two lenses. The relatively short eyepiece focal length (2.50 cm) compared to the objective (100 cm) is what provides the telescope's high angular magnification of -40.0×. The physical length of 1.025 m makes this a reasonably portable telescope suitable for amateur astronomy.

A large reflecting telescope has an objective mirror with a  $$ 10.0 \text{m} $$
 radius of curvature. What angular magnification does it produce when a  $$3.00 \text{m} $$
 focal length eyepiece is used?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a concave mirror, the focal length is $$f_o = R/2$$ where $$R$$ is the radius of curvature. The angular magnification of a telescope is $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Mirror radius of curvature: $$R = 10.0 \text{ m}$$
- Eyepiece focal length: $$f_e = 3.00 \text{ m}$$

Calculate the objective (mirror) focal length:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_o = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{10.0 \text{ m}}{2} = 5.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the angular magnification:

<div class="equation">
 $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} = -\frac{5.00 \text{ m}}{3.00 \text{ m}} = -1.67$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This large reflecting telescope has a modest angular magnification of only -1.67. This may seem surprisingly low for such a large instrument, but this is actually by design for certain applications.

The extremely long eyepiece focal length (3.00 m = 300 cm) is unusual—most eyepieces have focal lengths of 1-5 cm. This ultra-long focal length eyepiece produces minimal magnification but offers several advantages:
1. **Wide field of view**: Essential for survey telescopes that map large areas of sky
2. **Bright images**: Lower magnification concentrates light, making faint extended objects (nebulae, galaxies) easier to see
3. **Easier alignment and tracking**: Less magnification means less sensitivity to vibration and tracking errors

This configuration is characteristic of:
- **Schmidt cameras** used for photographic sky surveys
- **Wide-field survey telescopes** searching for asteroids, comets, or supernovae
- **Astrograph telescopes** designed for astrophotography rather than visual observation

For comparison, changing to a more typical 25 mm (0.025 m) eyepiece would give:
$$M = -5.00/0.025 = -200$$, which is more typical for visual astronomy.

The negative sign indicates an inverted image. For reflecting telescopes, additional mirrors are often used to fold the light path and make the telescope more compact, which can also affect image orientation. The 5.00 m focal length with 10.0 m radius of curvature follows the mirror equation perfectly, confirming this is a spherical or parabolic primary mirror typical of large research telescopes.

A small telescope has a concave mirror with a 2.00 m radius of curvature for its objective. Its eyepiece is a 4.00 cm focal length lens. (a) What is the telescope's angular magnification? (b) What angle is subtended by a 25 000 km diameter sunspot? (c) What is the angle of its telescopic image?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the angular magnification formula $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$. The focal length of a concave mirror is $$f = R/2$$. For part (b), the angle subtended by an object is approximately $$\theta \approx \frac{d}{D}$$ for small angles, where $$d$$ is the object diameter and $$D$$ is the distance. For part (c), the telescopic image angle is $$\theta' = M \times \theta$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Mirror radius of curvature: $$R = 2.00 \text{ m}$$
- Eyepiece focal length: $$f_e = 4.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0400 \text{ m}$$
- Sunspot diameter: $$d = 25\,000 \text{ km} = 2.50 \times 10^7 \text{ m}$$
- Sun-Earth distance: $$D = 1.50 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}$$ (average)

**(a)** Calculate the objective focal length:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_o = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{2.00 \text{ m}}{2} = 1.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

Calculate the angular magnification:

<div class="equation">
 $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} = -\frac{1.00 \text{ m}}{0.0400 \text{ m}} = -25.0$$
</div>

**(b)** Calculate the angle subtended by the sunspot (in radians):

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = \frac{d}{D} = \frac{2.50 \times 10^7 \text{ m}}{1.50 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}} = 1.67 \times 10^{-4} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

Convert to arc seconds (1 rad = 206,265 arc seconds):

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = (1.67 \times 10^{-4})(206\,265) = 34.4 \text{ arc seconds}$$
</div>

**(c)** Calculate the angle of the telescopic image:

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta' = |M| \times \theta = 25.0 \times (1.67 \times 10^{-4} \text{ rad}) = 4.18 \times 10^{-3} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

Convert to arc minutes:

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta' = (4.18 \times 10^{-3})(206\,265/60) = 14.3 \text{ arc minutes} = 0.239°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The telescope has an angular magnification of -25.0, which is modest but quite useful for astronomical observations. The negative sign indicates an inverted image, which is typical and acceptable for astronomical telescopes.

Part (b): The sunspot subtends an angle of about 34.4 arc seconds (about 0.0096°) when viewed with the naked eye. This is quite small—for reference, the full Moon subtends about 1,800 arc seconds (0.5°). A 25,000 km sunspot is actually quite large, roughly twice Earth's diameter!

Part (c): Through the telescope, the sunspot image subtends 14.3 arc minutes (0.239°), which is nearly half the angular diameter of the full Moon. This makes the sunspot much easier to observe and study in detail. The 25× magnification transforms a barely visible feature (34 arc seconds) into one that's readily observable (14 arc minutes).

This problem demonstrates the power of even modest telescopes for solar astronomy. However, it's crucial to note that **observing the Sun directly through a telescope without proper solar filters is extremely dangerous and can cause permanent eye damage or blindness**. Professional solar observations use specialized equipment with appropriate filters.

A  $$7.5× $$
 binocular produces an angular magnification of  $$ -7.50 $$ ,
 acting like a telescope. (Mirrors are used to make the image upright.) If the binoculars have objective lenses with a 75.0 cm focal length, what is the focal length of the eyepiece lenses?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The angular magnification of a telescope is $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$. Given $$M = -7.50$$ and $$f_o = 75.0$$ cm, we solve for the eyepiece focal length $$f_e$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Angular magnification: $$M = -7.50$$
- Objective focal length: $$f_o = 75.0 \text{ cm}$$

Using the magnification equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$
</div>

Rearranging to solve for $$f_e$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_e = -\frac{f_o}{M} = -\frac{75.0 \text{ cm}}{-7.50} = 10.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The eyepiece lenses have a focal length of +10.0 cm. The positive focal length indicates convex (converging) lenses, which is standard for binocular eyepieces.

This binocular configuration is typical for quality optics:
- **7.5× magnification**: A good balance between magnification and field of view, suitable for general observation, wildlife viewing, and sports events
- **75 cm objective**: Quite long, suggesting these are high-quality binoculars with excellent light-gathering capability
- **10 cm eyepiece**: Standard focal length providing comfortable viewing

The problem states mirrors are used to make the image upright. In standard binoculars, the optical path includes:
1. Objective lens creates inverted real image (as in a telescope)
2. Prism system (typically Porro prisms or roof prisms) uses multiple internal reflections to:
   - Reinvert the image to make it upright
   - Fold the optical path to make binoculars more compact
   - Separate the objectives for stereoscopic (3D) viewing

The mathematical magnification is -7.50, but the actual viewed image is upright due to the prism system, giving an effective +7.5× magnification for the user.

Binocular specifications are commonly written as "7.5×50" where:
- First number (7.5): magnification
- Second number (50 typically): objective diameter in mm

The 75 cm focal length with standard 50 mm objectives would make these rather large binoculars, possibly:
- Astronomical binoculars for stargazing
- Marine binoculars for ship navigation
- Long-range surveillance binoculars

The 10 cm eyepiece focal length is quite generous, contributing to a comfortable eye relief (distance from eye to eyepiece) and wide apparent field of view.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider a telescope of the type used by Galileo, having a convex objective and
a concave eyepiece as illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(a). Construct a
problem in which you calculate the location and size of the image produced.
Among the things to be considered are the focal lengths of the lenses and their
relative placements as well as the size and location of the object. Verify that
the angular magnification is greater than one. That is, the angle subtended at
the eye by the image is greater than the angle subtended by the object.

**Guidance for Constructing This Problem**

When constructing a problem for a Galilean telescope (convex objective + concave eyepiece), follow this framework:

**Choose Your Parameters:**

1. **Objective lens**: Select a convex lens with focal length $$f_o$$ (e.g., $$f_o = +50.0$$ cm)
2. **Eyepiece lens**: Select a concave lens with focal length $$f_e$$ (e.g., $$f_e = -5.00$$ cm, negative because it's concave)
3. **Object**: Choose a distant object (e.g., the Moon at $$d_o = 3.84 \times 10^8$$ m, diameter 3,476 km)
4. **Lens separation**: Set $$L = f_o + f_e$$ (e.g., $$L = 50.0 - 5.0 = 45.0$$ cm for an upright final image)

**Problem to Solve:**

"A Galilean telescope has a +50.0 cm focal length convex objective and a -5.00 cm focal length concave eyepiece placed 45.0 cm apart. An observer views the Moon (diameter 3,476 km at distance $$3.84 \times 10^8$$ m). Calculate: (a) the location and size of the intermediate image formed by the objective, (b) the location and magnification of the final image, (c) the angular magnification of the telescope."

**Solution Approach:**

**(a)** For the objective (object at infinity):
- Use $$\frac{1}{f_o} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
- Since $$d_o \approx \infty$$, then $$d_i \approx f_o = 50.0$$ cm
- Image size: $$h_i = h_o \times \frac{d_i}{d_o} = (3.476 \times 10^6 \text{ m}) \times \frac{0.50 \text{ m}}{3.84 \times 10^8 \text{ m}} = 4.52 \text{ mm}$$

**(b)** For the eyepiece:
- Object distance: $$d'_o = L - d_i = 45.0 - 50.0 = -5.00$$ cm (virtual object)
- Use $$\frac{1}{f_e} = \frac{1}{d'_o} + \frac{1}{d'_i}$$: $$\frac{1}{-5.00} = \frac{1}{-5.00} + \frac{1}{d'_i}$$
- This gives $$d'_i = \infty$$ (final image at infinity—relaxed viewing)
- Magnification: $$m_e = -\frac{d'_i}{d'_o} = -\frac{\infty}{-5.00} \approx \infty$$ (but angular magnification is finite)

**(c)** Angular magnification:
- $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} = -\frac{50.0}{-5.00} = +10.0$$
- The positive value confirms an upright final image (key advantage of Galilean telescopes)
- Verify: $$M > 1$$, confirming magnification

**Key Features of Galilean Telescopes:**

1. **Upright image**: Unlike Keplerian telescopes, the image remains upright ($$M > 0$$)
2. **Compact design**: Length $$L = f_o + f_e < f_o$$ (shorter than Keplerian)
3. **Limited field of view**: The concave eyepiece restricts the field of view
4. **Applications**: Opera glasses, binoculars, Galileo's original telescopes

This construction demonstrates why Galileo's design was revolutionary—it provided magnification with an upright image in a compact package.
