### Law of Conservation of Energy

Energy, as we have noted, is conserved, making it one of the most important
physical quantities in nature. The **law of conservation of energy** can be
stated as follows:

_Total energy is constant in any process. It may change in form or be
transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same._

We have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from
one system to another. This exploration led to the definition of two major types
of energy—mechanical energy $$ \left(\KE+\PE\right) $$ and energy transferred
via work done by nonconservative forces $$ \left(W\_ {\text{nc}}\right) $$. But energy takes _many_ other forms, manifesting itself
in _many_ different ways, and we need to be able to deal with all of these
before we can write an equation for the above general statement of the
conservation of energy.

### Other Forms of Energy than Mechanical Energy

At this point, we deal with all other forms of energy by lumping them into a
single group called other energy ( $$ \text{OE} $$). Then we can state the
conservation of energy in equation form as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}+\text{OE}_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>

All types of energy and work can be included in this very general statement of
conservation of energy. Kinetic energy is $$ \KE $$, work done by a conservative
force is represented by $$ \PE $$, work done by nonconservative forces is $$ W\_ {\text{nc}} $$, and all other energies are included as $$ \text{OE} $$. This
equation applies to all previous examples; in those situations $$ \text{OE} $$
was constant, and so it subtracted out and was not directly considered.

Making Connections: Usefulness of the Energy Conservation Principle
</div>
The fact that energy is conserved and has many forms makes it very important. You will find that energy is discussed in many contexts, because it is involved in all processes. It will also become apparent that many situations are best understood in terms of energy and that problems are often most easily conceptualized and solved by considering energy.

</div>

When does $$ \text{OE} $$ play a role? One example occurs when a person eats.
Food is oxidized with the release of carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Some of
this chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when the person moves, to
potential energy when the person changes altitude, and to thermal energy (
another form of $$ \text{OE} $$).

### Some of the Many Forms of Energy

What are some other forms of energy? You can probably name a number of forms of
energy not yet discussed. Many of these will be covered in later chapters, but
let us detail a few here. **Electrical energy** is a common form that is
converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical
situations. Fuels, such as gasoline and food, carry **chemical energy**
that can be transferred to a system through oxidation. Chemical fuel can also
produce electrical

energy, such as in batteries. Batteries can in turn produce light, which is a
very pure form of energy. Most energy sources on Earth are in fact stored energy
from the energy we receive from the Sun. We sometimes refer to this as **radiant
energy**, or electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, infrared,
and ultraviolet radiation.
**Nuclear energy** comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass
into energy. Nuclear energy is transformed into the energy of sunlight, into
electrical energy in power plants, and into the energy of the heat transfer and
blast in weapons. Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion.
This internal mechanical energy from the random motions is called **thermal
energy**, because it is related to the temperature of the object. These and all
other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work.

[Table 1](#Table1) gives the amount of energy stored, used, or released from
various objects and in various phenomena. The range of energies and the variety
of types and situations is impressive.

<div class="title">
Problem-Solving Strategies for Energy
</div>
You will find the following problem-solving strategies useful whenever you deal with energy. The strategies help in organizing and reinforcing energy concepts. In fact, they are used in the examples presented in this chapter. The familiar general problem-solving strategies presented earlier—involving identifying physical principles, knowns, and unknowns, checking units, and so on—continue to be relevant here.

**Step 1.** Determine the system of interest and identify what information is
given and what quantity is to be calculated. A sketch will help.

**Step 2.** Examine all the forces involved and determine whether you know or
are given the potential energy from the work done by the forces. Then use step 3
or step 4.

**Step 3.** If you know the potential energies for the forces that enter into
the problem, then forces are all conservative, and you can apply conservation of
mechanical energy simply in terms of potential and kinetic energy. The equation
expressing conservation of energy is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>

**Step 4.** If you know the potential energy for only some of the forces,
possibly because some of them are nonconservative and do not have a potential
energy, or if there are other energies that are not easily treated in terms of
force and work, then the conservation of energy law in its most general form
must be used.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}+\text{OE}_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>
In most problems, one or more of the terms is zero, simplifying its solution. Do not calculate $$ W_{c} $$, the work done by conservative forces; it is already incorporated in the $$ \PE $$ terms.

**Step 5.** You have already identified the types of work and energy involved (
in step 2). Before solving for the unknown, _eliminate terms wherever possible_
to simplify the algebra. For example, choose $$ h=0 $$ at either the initial or
final point, so that $$ \PE\_{\text{g}} $$ is zero there. Then solve for the
unknown in the customary manner.

**Step 6.** _Check the answer to see if it is reasonable_. Once you have solved
a problem, reexamine the forms of work and energy to see if you have set up the
conservation of energy equation correctly. For example, work done against
friction should be negative, potential energy at the bottom of a hill should be
less than that at the top, and so on. Also check to see that the numerical value
obtained is reasonable. For example, the final speed of a skateboarder who
coasts down a 3-m-high ramp could reasonably be 20 km/h, but _not_ 80 km/h.

</div>

### Transformation of Energy

The transformation of energy from one form into others is happening all the
time. The chemical energy in food is converted into thermal energy through
metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through
photosynthesis. In a larger example, the chemical energy contained in coal is
converted into thermal energy as it burns to turn water into steam in a boiler.
This thermal energy in the steam in turn is converted to mechanical energy as it
spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical
energy. (In all of these examples, not all of the initial energy is converted
into the forms mentioned. This important point is discussed later in this
section.)

Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging
on a solar cell (see [Figure 1](#Figure1)) produces electricity, which in turn can
be used to run an electric motor. Energy is converted from the primary source of
solar energy into electrical energy and then into mechanical energy.

### Efficiency

Even though energy is conserved in an energy conversion process, the output of
_useful energy_ or work will be less than the energy input. The **efficiency**
$$ \text{Eff} $$ of an energy conversion process is defined as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Efficiency}\left(\text{Eff}\right)=\frac{ \text{useful energy or work output}}{\text{total energy input}}=\frac{ W_{\text{out}}}{ E_{\text{in}}}. $$
</div>

[Table 2](#Table2) lists some efficiencies of mechanical devices and human
activities. In a coal-fired power plant, for example, about 40% of the chemical
energy in the coal becomes useful electrical energy. The other 60% transforms
into other (perhaps less useful) energy forms, such as thermal energy, which is
then released to the environment through combustion gases and cooling towers.

### Section Summary

- The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy is constant in
  any process. Energy may change in form or be transferred from one system to
  another, but the total remains the same.
- When all forms of energy are considered, conservation of energy is written in
  equation form as $$ \KE_ {i}+\PE_{i}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{i}=\KE_ {f}+\PE_{f}+\text{OE}\_{f} $$, where $$ \text{OE} $$ is all **other forms of
  energy** besides mechanical energy.
- Commonly encountered forms of energy include electric energy, chemical energy,
  radiant energy, nuclear energy, and thermal energy.
- Energy is often utilized to do work, but it is not possible to convert all the
  energy of a system to work.
- The efficiency $$ \text{Eff} $$ of a machine or human is defined to be $$ \text{Eff}=\frac{ W_{\text{out}}}{ E_{\text{in}}} $$, where $$ W_{\text{out}} $$ is useful work output and $$ E\_{\text{in}} $$ is the energy consumed.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Consider the following scenario. A car for which friction is *not* negligible accelerates from 
rest down a hill, running out of gasoline after a short distance. The driver lets the car coast 
farther down the hill, then up and over a small crest. He then coasts down that hill into a gas 
station, where he brakes to a stop and fills the tank with gasoline. Identify the forms of energy the 
car has, and how they are changed and transferred in this series of events. (See [Figure 3](#Figure3).)

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Using values from [Table 1](#Table1), how many DNA molecules could be broken by the energy carried by a single electron in the beam of an old-fashioned TV tube? (These electrons were not dangerous in themselves, but they did create dangerous x rays. Later model tube TVs had shielding that absorbed x rays before they escaped and exposed viewers.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 1, the energy of a single electron in a TV tube beam is $$ 4.0 \times 10^{-15} $$ J, and the energy to break one DNA strand is $$ 10^{-19} $$ J. We divide the electron's energy by the energy per DNA strand.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{Number of DNA molecules} &=& \frac{\text{Energy of electron}}{\text{Energy per DNA strand}}\\
&=& \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-15}\J}{10^{-19}\J}\\
&=& 4.0 \times 10^{4}\text{ molecules}
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

A single electron in an old TV tube beam carries enough energy to break approximately 40,000 DNA strands. This illustrates why radiation damage at the molecular level can be so significant—a single high-energy particle can cause extensive damage. However, these electrons themselves don't penetrate the glass screen; the danger came from the x-rays they produced when they struck the screen, which is why later TV models included protective shielding.

**Answer**

A single electron can break approximately **40,000 DNA molecules**.

<div class="problem"  markdown="1">
Using energy considerations and assuming negligible air resistance, show that a rock thrown from a bridge 20.0 m above water with an initial speed of 15.0 m/s strikes the water with a speed of 24.8 m/s independent of the direction thrown.

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use conservation of mechanical energy. Since air resistance is negligible, only conservative forces act (gravity), so the total mechanical energy is conserved: $$ \KE_i + \PE_i = \KE_f + \PE_f $$. The initial kinetic energy depends only on the magnitude of velocity, not its direction, and the change in potential energy depends only on the vertical height change.

**Solution**

Starting with conservation of energy:

<div class="equation">
$$ \KE_i + \PE_i = \KE_f + \PE_f $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + 0 $$
</div>

where we set the water level as the zero potential energy reference ($$ h_f = 0 $$). Canceling mass and solving for $$ v_f $$:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{2}v_0^2 + gh = \frac{1}{2}v_f^2 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_f = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh} $$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
$$ v_f = \sqrt{(15.0\text{ m/s})^2 + 2(9.80\text{ m/s}^2)(20.0\text{ m})} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v_f = \sqrt{225\text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2 + 392\text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = \sqrt{617\text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 24.8\text{ m/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The final speed is independent of the direction the rock is thrown because the formula $$ v_f = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh} $$ depends only on the magnitude of the initial velocity, not its direction. Whether thrown horizontally, upward at an angle, or downward, the same initial speed and height change produce the same final speed. This is a powerful demonstration of energy conservation—the path taken doesn't matter, only the initial and final states.

**Answer**

The rock strikes the water with a speed of **24.8 m/s**, independent of the direction thrown.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If the energy in fusion bombs were used to supply the energy needs of the world, how many of the 9-megaton variety would be needed for a year's supply of energy (using data from [Table 1](#Table1))? This is not as far-fetched as it may sound—there are thousands of nuclear bombs, and their energy can be trapped in underground explosions and converted to electricity, as natural geothermal energy is.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 1, the annual world energy use is approximately $$ 4 \times 10^{20}\J $$ and a 9-megaton fusion bomb releases $$ 3.8 \times 10^{16}\J $$ of energy. We divide the annual energy need by the energy per bomb.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{Number of bombs} &=& \frac{\text{Annual energy use}}{\text{Energy per bomb}}\\
&=& \frac{4 \times 10^{20}\J}{3.8 \times 10^{16}\J}\\
&=& 1.05 \times 10^{4} \approx 10,000 \text{ bombs}
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Approximately 10,000 nine-megaton fusion bombs would be needed to supply the world's annual energy needs. While this seems like a large number, it illustrates the enormous energy content of nuclear fusion. However, using nuclear weapons for energy production is impractical and dangerous, which is why controlled fusion research aims to harness this energy safely.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) Use of hydrogen fusion to supply energy is a dream that may be realized in the next century. Fusion would be a relatively clean and almost limitless supply of energy, as can be seen from [Table 1](#Table1). To illustrate this, calculate how many years the present energy needs of the world could be supplied by one millionth of the oceans' hydrogen fusion energy.
(b) How does this time compare with historically significant events, such as the duration of stable economic systems?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From Table 1, the fusion of all hydrogen in Earth's oceans would release $$ 10^{34} $$ J of energy, and the annual world energy use is $$ 4 \times 10^{20} $$ J. For part (a), divide one millionth of the ocean's fusion energy by the annual energy consumption. For part (b), compare this timescale to historical events.

**Solution**

**(a)** First, calculate one millionth of the ocean's hydrogen fusion energy:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_{\text{available}} = \frac{10^{34}\text{ J}}{10^{6}} = 10^{28}\text{ J} $$
</div>

Now divide by annual world energy use:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Number of years} = \frac{E_{\text{available}}}{E_{\text{annual}}} = \frac{10^{28}\text{ J}}{4 \times 10^{20}\text{ J/year}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Number of years} = 2.5 \times 10^{7}\text{ years} = 25\text{ million years} $$
</div>

**(b)** This timescale of 25 million years is extraordinarily long compared to human history. Recorded human civilization spans only about 5,000 years. Even stable economic systems typically last only centuries, not millennia. This time period is comparable to geological time scales—for instance, it's roughly the time since the late Oligocene epoch when many modern mammal groups emerged.

**Discussion**

The calculation reveals the almost incomprehensible magnitude of energy potentially available from fusion. Even using just one millionth of the ocean's hydrogen would power human civilization for 25 million years at current consumption rates. This is about 5,000 times longer than recorded human history and far longer than any economic or political system has ever lasted. This illustrates why controlled fusion is called the "holy grail" of energy production—it would essentially solve humanity's energy problems for geological timescales.

**Answer**

(a) One millionth of the ocean's hydrogen fusion energy could supply the world's energy needs for approximately **25 million years**.

(b) This timescale is vastly longer than any human historical period—about 5,000 times the length of recorded civilization and far exceeding the duration of any stable economic system.
