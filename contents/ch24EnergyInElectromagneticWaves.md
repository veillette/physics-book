* Explain how the energy and amplitude of an electromagnetic wave are related.

</div>

Anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in **electromagnetic
waves**. Sometimes this energy is obvious, such as in the warmth of the summer
sun. Other times it is subtle, such as the unfelt energy of gamma rays, which
can destroy living cells.

Electromagnetic waves can bring energy into a system by virtue of their **electric and magnetic fields**. These fields can exert forces and move charges
in the system and, thus, do work on them. If the frequency of the
electromagnetic wave is the same as the natural frequencies of the system (such
as microwaves at the resonant frequency of water molecules), the transfer of
energy is much more efficient.

Connections: Waves and Particles
</div>
The behavior of electromagnetic radiation clearly exhibits wave characteristics. But we shall find in later modules that at high frequencies, electromagnetic radiation also exhibits particle characteristics. These particle characteristics will be used to explain more of the properties of the electromagnetic spectrum and to introduce the formal study of modern physics.

Another startling discovery of modern physics is that particles, such as
electrons and protons, exhibit wave characteristics. This simultaneous sharing
of wave and particle properties for all submicroscopic entities is one of the
great symmetries in nature.

![The propagation of two electromagnetic waves is shown in three dimensional planes. The first wave shows with the variation of two components E and B. E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the vibrations of particles in the plane. B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the E wave. The B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because E and B are perpendicular to each other. The direction of propagation of wave is shown perpendicular to E and B waves. The energy carried is given as E sub u. The second wave shows with the variation of the components two E and two B, that is, E and B waves with double the amplitude of the first case. Two E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the vibrations of particles in the plane. Two B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the two E wave. The two B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because two E and two B waves are perpendicular to each other. The direction of propagation of wave is shown perpendicular to two E and two B waves. The energy carried is given as four E sub u.](../resources/Figure_24_04_01.jpg 'Energy carried by a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. With electromagnetic waves, larger ( E ) -fields and ( B ) -fields exert larger forces and can do more work.')
{: #Figure1}

But there is energy in an electromagnetic wave, whether it is absorbed or not.
Once created, the fields carry energy away from a source. If absorbed, the field
strengths are diminished and anything left travels on. Clearly, the larger the
strength of the electric and magnetic fields, the more work they can do and the
greater the energy the electromagnetic wave carries.

A wave’s energy is proportional to its **amplitude** squared ( $${E}^{2} $$ or
$${B}^{2} $$ ). This is true for waves on guitar strings, for water waves, and
for sound waves, where amplitude is proportional to pressure. In electromagnetic
waves, the amplitude is the **maximum field strength** of the electric and
magnetic fields. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

Thus the energy carried and the **intensity** $$I $$ of an electromagnetic wave
is proportional to $${E}^{2} $$ and $${B}^{2} $$ . In fact, for a continuous
sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, the average intensity $${I}_{\text{ave}} $$ is
given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ c\epsilon_{0}{E}_{0}^{2}}{2}, $$
</div>

where $$c $$ is the speed of light, $${\epsilon }_{0} $$ is the permittivity of
free space, and $${E}_{0} $$ is the maximum electric field strength; intensity,
as always, is power per unit area (here in $${\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ).

The average intensity of an electromagnetic wave $${I}_{\text{ave}} $$ can also
be expressed in terms of the magnetic field strength by using the relationship
$$B=E/c $$ , and the fact that $${\epsilon }_{0}=1/{\mu }_{0}{c}^{2} $$ , where
$${\mu }\_{0} $$ is the permeability of free space. Algebraic manipulation
produces the relationship

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\text{cB}}_{0}^{2}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}, $$
</div>

where $${B}_{0} $$ is the maximum magnetic field strength.

One more expression for $${I}_{\text{ave}} $$ in terms of both electric and
magnetic field strengths is useful. Substituting the fact that $$c\cdot {B}_{0}={E}_{0}$$, the previous expression becomes

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {E}_{0}{B}_{0}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}. $$
</div>

Whichever of the three preceding equations is most convenient can be used, since
they are really just different versions of the same principle: Energy in a wave
is related to amplitude squared. Furthermore, since these equations are based on
the assumption that the electromagnetic waves are sinusoidal, peak intensity is
twice the average; that is, $${I}_{0}=2{I}_{\text{ave}} $$.

Calculate Microwave Intensities and Fields
</div>
On its highest power setting, a certain microwave oven projects 1.00 kW of microwaves onto a 30.0 by 40.0 cm area. (a) What is the intensity in  $${\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ?
 (b) Calculate the peak electric field strength  $${E}_{0} $$
 in these waves. (c) What is the peak magnetic field strength  $${B}_{0} $$ ?

**Strategy**

In part (a), we can find intensity from its definition as power per unit area.
Once the intensity is known, we can use the equations below to find the field
strengths asked for in parts (b) and (c).

**Solution for (a)**

Entering the given power into the definition of intensity, and noting the area
is 0.300 by 0.400 m, yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{1.00 \text{kW}}{0.300 \text{m} × 0.400 \text{m}}. $$
</div>
Here  $$I={I}_{\text{ave}} $$ ,
 so that

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{1000 \text{W}}{ 0.120 {\text{m}}^{2}}= 8.33 \times 10^{3}  {\text{W/m}}^{2}. $$
</div>
Note that the peak intensity is twice the average:

<div class="equation" >
 $${I}_{0}=2{I}_{\text{ave}}= 1.67 \times 10^{4}  \text{W}/{\text{m}}^{2}. $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

To find $${E}_{0} $$ , we can rearrange the first equation given above for
$${I}\_{\text{ave}} $$ to give

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{0}={\left(\frac{2{I}_{\text{ave}}}{ c\epsilon_{0}}\right)}^{1/2}. $$
</div>
Entering known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{E}_{0}& =& \sqrt{\frac{2\left( 8.33 \times 10^{3}  {\text{W/m}}^{2}\right)}{\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)\left(8.85 \times 10^{-12} {\text{C}}^{2}/\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\right)}}\\ & =&  2.51 \times 10^{3}  \text{V/m}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Solution for (c)**

Perhaps the easiest way to find magnetic field strength, now that the electric
field strength is known, is to use the relationship given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${B}_{0}=\frac{ {E}_{0}}{c}. $$
</div>
Entering known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{B}_{0}& =& \frac{ 2.51 \times 10^{3}  \text{V/m}}{ 3.0 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}\\ & =&  8.35 \times 10^{-6}  \text{T}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

As before, a relatively strong electric field is accompanied by a relatively
weak magnetic field in an electromagnetic wave, since $$B=E/c $$ , and $$c $$ is
a large number.

</div>

### Section Summary

- The energy carried by any wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. For
  electromagnetic waves, this means intensity can be expressed as

  <div class="equation" >
   $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ c\epsilon_{0}{E}_{0}^{2}}{2}, $$
  </div>

where $${I}_{\text{ave}} $$ is the average intensity in $${\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ ,
and $${E}_{0} $$ is the maximum electric field strength of a continuous
sinusoidal wave.

- This can also be expressed in terms of the maximum magnetic field strength
  $${B}_{0} $$ as

  <div class="equation" >
   $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\text{cB}}_{0}^{2}}{ {2\mu }_{0}} $$
  </div>

and in terms of both electric and magnetic fields as

  <div class="equation" >
   $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {E}_{0}{B}_{0}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}. $$
  </div>

- The three expressions for $${I}_{\text{ave}} $$ are all equivalent.

Discussion
</div>
An intensity of 20.7 W/m² is relatively modest compared to sunlight (which averages about 1000 W/m² at Earth's surface on a clear day). This level of electromagnetic radiation is typical of what you might experience near a moderately powered radio transmitter or microwave communication device. The calculation demonstrates how the energy flux in an electromagnetic wave scales with the square of the electric field—doubling the electric field quadruples the intensity. This is because intensity represents power per unit area, and the power delivered by an electromagnetic wave depends on both the electric and magnetic fields, each of which is proportional to the amplitude, giving an overall E² dependence.

<div class="title">

The intensity of the electromagnetic wave is 20.7 W/m².

This intensity of 1.91 mW/m² is extremely weak—about 500,000 times weaker than sunlight. Such weak electromagnetic radiation is typical of what might be received from distant radio sources or weak broadcast signals. The very small magnetic field strength of 4 nanotesla (about 100,000 times weaker than Earth's magnetic field) corresponds to this low intensity. This demonstrates an important point: electromagnetic waves can have very weak field strengths yet still be detectable with sensitive instruments. Radio telescopes, for example, routinely detect signals with intensities millions of times weaker than this.

Discussion
</div>
The intensity of 318 W/m² from this small laser is actually quite significant—about one-third the intensity of sunlight. This high intensity is achieved by concentrating a modest power (0.250 mW) into a very small area (less than 1 mm² diameter spot). This is why laser pointers, despite their low power, can be dangerous to eyes—the concentrated beam delivers substantial intensity to the small area of the retina.

The electric field strength of 490 V/m is modest compared to the breakdown field of air (about 3 MV/m), which is why the laser doesn't ionize air. The magnetic field of 1.63 μT is very weak—about 30 times weaker than Earth's magnetic field—demonstrating again that electromagnetic waves have relatively weak magnetic components compared to their electric components when measured in everyday units.

Helium-neon lasers produce coherent red light at 632.8 nm and are commonly used in physics labs for interference and diffraction experiments, as well as in barcode scanners and surveying equipment.

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
The intensity of 8.84 μW/m² at 30 km is very weak—more than 100 million times weaker than sunlight. Yet AM radios can easily detect this signal because they're specifically tuned to resonate at the transmission frequency, amplifying the weak signal. The electric field of 81.6 mV/m is tiny compared to everyday electric fields, but the radio's antenna and circuitry are designed to pick up these weak oscillating fields.

The inverse-square law is evident here: doubling the distance reduces the intensity by a factor of 4. This is why AM radio stations need powerful transmitters (often 50 kW or more) to cover large areas. The hemisphere model (rather than a full sphere) is reasonable because the ground reflects some radiation upward but also absorbs much of it, and we're interested in the intensity above ground level. In reality, the ground's conductivity, atmospheric conditions, and time of day (affecting ionospheric reflection) all influence actual signal strength.

<div class="title">

(a) The intensity 30.0 km away is $$8.84 \times 10^{-6}$$ W/m² or 8.84 μW/m². (b) The maximum electric field strength at this distance is 81.6 mV/m.

Discussion

The safe distance of 89.2 cm (about 3 feet) is quite close to the leaking radar unit. This illustrates why early radar technicians who worked in close proximity to equipment developed health problems—the leaked microwave radiation was intense enough at typical working distances to cause tissue heating and damage, particularly to the eyes (causing cataracts) because the lens has poor blood circulation and can't dissipate heat effectively.

Modern radar units have much better shielding and leak far less power, making them safer. The safe intensity limit of 1.00 W/m² is based on thermal effects—microwaves at this intensity can cause measurable tissue heating. The electric field of 27.4 V/m at the safe intensity seems modest, but remember that this oscillates at microwave frequencies (typically GHz), and the energy is efficiently absorbed by water molecules in tissue, causing rotation and heating.

The inverse-square law means that moving just twice as far away (to about 1.8 m) would reduce the intensity to 0.25 W/m², well below the safety threshold. This is why maintaining distance from microwave sources is an effective safety measure.

<div class="title">

(a) You must be at least 89.2 cm away to be exposed to the safe intensity. (b) The maximum electric field strength at the safe intensity is 27.4 V/m.

The intensity of $$7.47 \times 10^{-14}$$ W/m² is incredibly weak—about 10 trillion times weaker than sunlight! Yet satellite dishes can receive clear TV signals at this intensity because: (1) the large dish area (4.91 m²) collects enough power (367 femtowatts) for detection, (2) the receiver is tuned to resonate at the specific broadcast frequency, amplifying the signal, and (3) modern low-noise amplifiers can detect extraordinarily weak signals.

The satellite's transmitted power of 1.12 kW seems modest for broadcasting over such a large area ($$1.50 \times 10^{13}$$ m², roughly the area of North America). This is possible because: (1) satellites use directional antennas that focus power toward Earth rather than radiating uniformly in all directions, (2) the signal is digital and error-correcting codes allow recovery of information even from weak, noisy signals, and (3) geosynchronous satellites at 36,000 km altitude have a clear line-of-sight to ground receivers with minimal atmospheric absorption.

This problem beautifully illustrates how modern communications can work with incredibly weak signals through clever engineering—sensitive receivers, large collecting areas, frequency tuning, and signal processing.

These numbers are extraordinary! The magnetic field of 333 T is about 7 million times stronger than Earth's magnetic field and rivals the strongest magnetic fields ever produced in laboratories (which can damage equipment and are dangerous to humans). The intensity of $$1.33 \times 10^{19}$$ W/m² is incomprehensibly large—about 10 trillion times the intensity of sunlight!

Such extreme intensities are achieved by concentrating enormous power into a tiny area for a very brief time. This particular laser delivers 13.3 kJ of energy to a 1 mm² area in just 1 nanosecond, corresponding to an instantaneous power of $$1.33 \times 10^{13}$$ W or 13.3 terawatts—more than the total electrical generating capacity of the entire United States, concentrated in a pinpoint!

These ultra-high-intensity pulsed lasers are used in inertial confinement fusion experiments, where the intense electromagnetic fields compress and heat fusion fuel pellets to conditions similar to those in the core of stars. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses 192 such laser beams focused on a tiny capsule. When such intense fields interact with matter, non-linear effects dominate, electrons are stripped from atoms almost instantly, and the material becomes a plasma. The electric fields are strong enough to accelerate electrons to near-relativistic speeds within the wavelength of the light itself.

We'll use the relationship between peak and rms values for sinusoidal waves, and the fact that intensity is proportional to the square of the field amplitude. We can use either electric or magnetic fields; the result is the same.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
The intensity of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of the electric field:

<div class="equation">
 $$I \propto E^{2}$$
</div>

For a sinusoidal wave, the instantaneous electric field is $$E(t)=E_{0}\sin(\omega t)$$, where $$E_{0}$$ is the peak (maximum) value.

The peak intensity occurs when $$E=E_{0}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$I_{0} \propto E_{0}^{2}$$
</div>

The average intensity is related to the rms (root mean square) electric field:

<div class="equation">
 $$I_{\text{ave}} \propto E_{\text{rms}}^{2}$$
</div>

For a sinusoidal wave, the relationship between peak and rms values is:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{0}=\sqrt{2}E_{\text{rms}}$$
</div>

Squaring both sides:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{0}^{2}=2E_{\text{rms}}^{2}$$
</div>

Therefore:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\text{ave}}}=\frac{E_{0}^{2}}{E_{\text{rms}}^{2}}=2$$
</div>

Thus:

<div class="equation">
 $$I_{0}=2I_{\text{ave}}$$
</div>

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
This result makes physical sense: for a sinusoidal wave, the instantaneous intensity varies from zero (when the field passes through zero) to a maximum value $$I_{0}$$ (when the field is at its peak). The time-average of $$\sin^{2}(\omega t)$$ is $$\frac{1}{2}$$, so the average intensity is half the peak intensity.

This factor of 2 is important in practical applications. When we quote the intensity of a laser beam or the power output of a radio transmitter, we typically mean the average intensity. The peak intensity (which occurs twice per oscillation cycle) is twice this value. For low-power continuous-wave lasers, this distinction doesn't matter much, but for pulsed lasers or when considering nonlinear optical effects (which depend on peak intensity), the difference between peak and average intensity is crucial.

The same relationship holds for any sinusoidal quantity—electrical power in AC circuits, sound intensity from pure tones, etc. The rms value is used because it relates directly to average power, which is the physically meaningful quantity for energy transfer.

<div class="title">
Final Answer

For a continuous sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, the peak intensity is twice the average intensity: $$I_{0}=2I_{\text{ave}}$$, which follows from $$E_{0}=\sqrt{2}E_{\text{rms}}$$ and $$I \propto E^{2}$$.

For part (a), we use conservation of energy: the total power radiated must pass through any spherical surface centered on the source. For part (b), we use the relationship between intensity and field strength.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
**(a)** A source radiating power $$P$$ uniformly in all directions emits energy that spreads over spherical surfaces. At distance $$r$$ from the source, the power is distributed over a sphere of area $$A=4\pi r^{2}$$.

Intensity is power per unit area:

<div class="equation">
 $$I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}$$

Since $$P$$ and $$4\pi$$ are constants:

 $$I \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$$

 $$E_{0} \propto \frac{1}{r}$$

Therefore, the electric and magnetic field amplitudes decrease inversely with distance.

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
The inverse-square law is fundamental to understanding radiation from point sources. It follows directly from geometry—as radiation spreads out from a point, it must cover larger and larger spherical surfaces, diluting the intensity. Doubling the distance reduces the intensity by a factor of 4, tripling the distance reduces it by a factor of 9, and so on.

This has profound practical implications. Radio stations must use much higher power to reach distant listeners. The intensity of sunlight on Mars (1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth) is only $$(1/1.5)^{2} \approx 0.44$$ times the intensity on Earth. The faint signals from distant spacecraft (like Voyager, now billions of kilometers away) require enormous receiving antennas to collect enough power for communication.

The $$1/r$$ dependence of field strength (compared to $$1/r^{2}$$ for intensity) reflects the fact that intensity depends on the square of the field. This means that while field strength drops relatively slowly with distance, the power (which depends on field squared) drops much faster. This is why electromagnetic radiation can propagate over enormous distances—weak fields can still be detected—but the power received decreases rapidly, making long-distance communication challenging.

The inverse-square law applies to any form of radiation spreading from a point source, including light, radio waves, gamma rays, and even gravitational waves.

Discussion

A wavelength of 3.30 m corresponds to the FM radio band (around 91 MHz), which is in the VHF (Very High Frequency) range. The small capacitance (5 pF) and small inductance (613 nH) are typical of high-frequency LC oscillator circuits.

LC circuits work by exchanging energy between the electric field in the capacitor and the magnetic field in the inductor. When oscillating, they naturally radiate electromagnetic waves at their resonant frequency. In practical radio transmitters, the LC circuit is deliberately coupled to an antenna to efficiently radiate this energy into space.

The inductance of 613 nH is quite small—it could be just a few turns of wire or even the stray inductance of circuit traces on a printed circuit board. At these frequencies, careful circuit design is essential because even small parasitic capacitances and inductances can shift the resonant frequency. Modern FM transmitters and receivers use precisely manufactured components or tunable elements to maintain the exact frequency required by broadcast standards.

The relationship $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$ shows that to increase frequency, you need to decrease either L or C (or both). This is why high-frequency circuits use small capacitors and inductors, while low-frequency circuits (like 60 Hz power systems) use large values.

The radar signal undergoes a double Doppler shift: first when the moving vehicle receives the signal (shift due to approach), and second when the vehicle reflects it back to the radar (another shift). For speeds much less than $$c$$, the beat frequency is $$f_{\text{beat}}=\frac{2vf_{0}}{c}$$, where $$v$$ is the vehicle speed, $$f_{0}$$ is the original frequency, and $$c$$ is the speed of light.

Discussion
</div>
The vehicle speed of 15.0 m/s (54 km/h or about 34 mph) is a reasonable speed on city streets or residential areas. Police radar works on the principle of the Doppler effect: when a vehicle approaches the radar unit, it receives microwaves at a slightly higher frequency than transmitted (first Doppler shift). The vehicle then reflects these microwaves back, and since it's a moving source, the reflected signal undergoes a second Doppler shift in the same direction. The result is a double Doppler shift.

The radar unit mixes the returned signal with the original transmitted signal to produce a beat frequency—the difference between the two frequencies. This beat frequency is proportional to the vehicle's speed and is in the audio range (150 Hz in this case), making it easy to measure electronically.

The beauty of this technique is its precision: a beat frequency of 150 Hz measured from a 1.5 GHz carrier translates to a very accurate speed measurement. The frequency of 1.50 GHz (1500 MHz) is typical of X-band police radar, though K-band (24 GHz) and Ka-band (35 GHz) are also common in modern systems.

The approximation $$v \ll c$$ is extremely valid here: the vehicle speed is only $$5 \times 10^{-8}$$ times the speed of light, so relativistic effects are completely negligible. This same Doppler technique is used in weather radar (to measure wind speeds), astronomical observations (to measure stellar velocities), and medical ultrasound (to measure blood flow).

The power absorbed by the spaghetti (564 W) is less than the typical microwave oven output (often 800-1200 W) because not all the microwave energy is absorbed by the food—some is reflected, some heats the container, and the microwave distribution isn't perfectly uniform. The efficiency here is roughly 564/1000 ≈ 56%, which is reasonable for microwave heating.

The intensity of 18.0 kW/m² is quite high—about 18 times the intensity of sunlight. This explains why microwave ovens can heat food so quickly. The electric field strength of 3.68 kV/m is substantial but well below the breakdown field of air (about 3 MV/m), which is why the air inside the microwave doesn't ionize.

Microwave ovens operate at 2.45 GHz because this frequency is: (1) efficiently absorbed by water molecules (causing them to rotate and heat up), (2) assigned by regulatory authorities for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) use, avoiding interference with communications, and (3) penetrates a few centimeters into food, allowing internal heating rather than just surface heating.

The specific heat of the spaghetti (3.76 kJ/(kg·°C)) is close to that of water (4.18 kJ/(kg·°C)), which makes sense since cooked spaghetti is mostly water. The temperature rise of 45°C (from perhaps 20°C to 65°C) is typical for reheating food to a comfortable eating temperature.

The magnetic field of 12.3 μT is weak—about one-quarter the strength of Earth's magnetic field—showing again that electromagnetic waves carry most of their energy in the electric field component from a practical standpoint, though both components carry equal energy densities in the wave.

Discussion
</div>
The incident power of 8.43 picowatts is incredibly weak—about a trillion times less than a typical LED! Yet FM radios can receive clear signals at this power level because: (1) the receiver is tuned to resonate at exactly 100 MHz, amplifying signals at that frequency, (2) the multi-turn coil (200 turns) multiplies the induced voltage, and (3) modern low-noise amplifiers can detect microvolts of signal.

The average induced emf of 5.66 mV over a quarter cycle is small but workable for radio reception. The factor of 200 from the number of turns is crucial—without multiple turns, the signal would be 200 times weaker and much harder to detect.

The capacitance of 1.01 pF needed for resonance is very small—typical of high-frequency tuning circuits. At 100 MHz (in the FM broadcast band of 88-108 MHz), the LC circuit must be precisely tuned. Variable capacitors (varactors or tuning capacitors) allow the radio to select different stations by adjusting the resonant frequency.

The resonance condition $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$ shows that at resonance, the impedances of the inductor and capacitor cancel, allowing maximum current flow and maximum signal detection. This is how a radio "tunes in" to a specific station—by adjusting C (or L) until the circuit resonates at the desired frequency.

FM radio uses frequencies around 100 MHz because: (1) these frequencies can carry high-fidelity audio with frequency modulation, (2) they propagate by line-of-sight (unlike AM which can bounce off the ionosphere), giving reliable local coverage, and (3) the wavelength (about 3 m) is small enough for practical antennas yet large enough to avoid excessive atmospheric absorption.

For part (a), use the wave equation $$c=f\lambda$$ to calculate the wave speed. For part (b), compare the result to the known speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum. For part (c), identify which measurement or assumption is incorrect.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
**(a)** Given:
- Frequency: $$f=1.20 \text{ GHz}=1.20 \times 10^{9} \text{ Hz}$$
- Wavelength: $$\lambda=0.500 \text{ m}$$

Using the wave equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$v=f\lambda=\left(1.20 \times 10^{9} \text{ Hz}\right)\left(0.500 \text{ m}\right)=6.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**(b)** This result is unreasonable because the calculated speed is $$6.00 \times 10^{8}$$ m/s, which is twice the speed of light in vacuum ($$c=3.00 \times 10^{8}$$ m/s). According to special relativity, electromagnetic waves in vacuum always propagate at exactly $$c$$, and nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Even in material media, electromagnetic waves travel slower than $$c$$, never faster.

**(c)** Either the frequency measurement or the wavelength measurement (or both) is incorrect. The two measurements are inconsistent with each other for an electromagnetic wave.

If the frequency is correctly measured at 1.20 GHz, then the wavelength in vacuum should be:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{1.20 \times 10^{9} \text{ Hz}}=0.250 \text{ m}=25.0 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

Alternatively, if the wavelength is correctly measured at 0.500 m, then the frequency should be:

<div class="equation">
 $$f=\frac{c}{\lambda}=\frac{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}{0.500 \text{ m}}=6.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ Hz}=600 \text{ MHz}$$
</div>

The most likely error is in the wavelength measurement—it's probably 0.250 m, not 0.500 m. Alternatively, the frequency might be 600 MHz rather than 1.20 GHz.

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
This problem illustrates an important consistency check in electromagnetic wave measurements. The relationship $$c=f\lambda$$ is fundamental and inviolable for electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Any pair of measurements that violates this relationship indicates measurement error.

In this case, 1.20 GHz is in the microwave range (used for some satellite communications and radar), where the correct wavelength is 25 cm. A wavelength of 50 cm would correspond to 600 MHz, which is in the UHF television band.

Common sources of error in such measurements include:
1. **Frequency errors**: Misreading the oscillator frequency, having the oscillator operating at a harmonic (half or double the intended frequency)
2. **Wavelength errors**: Measuring the wrong distance (perhaps measuring a half-wavelength as a full wavelength, or including phase shifts in transmission lines)
3. **Medium effects**: Forgetting that the wave is propagating in a material medium rather than vacuum (though no known material has a refractive index less than 1, which would be required for faster-than-light propagation)

The fact that the calculated speed is exactly twice $$c$$ suggests a systematic error, perhaps measuring every other node in a standing wave pattern or a factor-of-2 error in the frequency setting.

This type of "unreasonable results" problem is valuable for developing physical intuition—recognizing when calculated results violate fundamental physical principles and then tracing back to find the error.

<div class="title">
Final Answer

(a) The calculated wave speed is $$6.00 \times 10^{8}$$ m/s. (b) This is unreasonable because it's twice the speed of light, violating special relativity—electromagnetic waves cannot exceed $$c$$ in vacuum. (c) The frequency and wavelength measurements are inconsistent; either the frequency is actually 600 MHz, or the wavelength is actually 0.250 m (25.0 cm).

For part (a), first find the frequency from $$f=\frac{c}{\lambda}$$, then use the LC resonance formula $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$ to solve for capacitance. For part (b), examine whether the calculated capacitance is physically reasonable. For part (c), identify which parameter is inconsistent with practical LC circuits.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
**(a)** Given:
- Wavelength: $$\lambda=1.00 \text{ m}$$
- Inductance: $$L=2.00 \text{ H}$$
- Speed of light: $$c=3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$

Find the frequency:

<div class="equation">

</div>

From the resonance formula $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$, solve for $$C$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$C=\frac{1}{(2\pi f)^{2}L}=\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}f^{2}L}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$C=\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}\left(3.00 \times 10^{8}\right)^{2}\left(2.00\right)}$$

</div>

**(b)** This capacitance is unreasonably small. At $$1.41 \times 10^{-19}$$ F (0.141 attofarads), it's far smaller than any practical capacitor. For comparison:
- Typical small capacitors: picofarads ($$10^{-12}$$ F) to microfarads ($$10^{-6}$$ F)
- Minimum practical capacitor: ~0.1 pF ($$10^{-13}$$ F)
- This result: $$10^{-19}$$ F, which is a million times smaller than the smallest practical capacitor

Such a small capacitance is comparable to the stray capacitance between individual atoms and is impossible to construct as a discrete circuit element.

**(c)** The inductance of 2.00 H is unreasonably large for a circuit operating at 300 MHz. Large inductances (in henries) are used in low-frequency applications like power supplies (50-60 Hz) or audio circuits (kHz range), not in radio-frequency circuits.

At 300 MHz, practical inductors are in the nanohenry (nH) to microhenry (μH) range:
- For a 1-m wavelength (300 MHz) with a reasonable capacitance of, say, 1 pF:

<div class="equation">
 $$L=\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}f^{2}C}=\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}\left(3.00 \times 10^{8}\right)^{2}\left(1.00 \times 10^{-12}\right)}=2.81 \times 10^{-7} \text{ H}=281 \text{ nH}$$
</div>

A 2.00-H inductor at 300 MHz would have enormous inductive reactance ($$X_L=2\pi fL=3.77 \times 10^{9}$$ Ω or 3.77 GΩ), making it impractical. Additionally, the large physical size and parasitic capacitance of a 2-H inductor would prevent it from operating effectively at such high frequencies.

The unreasonable assumption is using a large inductance (appropriate for low frequencies) in a high-frequency circuit. For an LC circuit to radiate efficiently at 300 MHz, both L and C must be small.

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
This problem illustrates a fundamental principle in RF circuit design: as frequency increases, both L and C must decrease. The product $$LC$$ determines the resonant frequency through $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$, so to achieve high frequency, you need small $$LC$$ products.

The relationship between component size and frequency is not arbitrary—it's dictated by:
1. **Physical size**: At high frequencies, wavelengths are comparable to component dimensions, making lumped-element analysis (treating L and C as discrete components) invalid for large components
2. **Parasitic effects**: Large inductors have significant parasitic capacitance between windings, and large capacitors have parasitic inductance in their leads
3. **Skin effect and losses**: AC resistance increases with frequency, making large inductors lossy at high frequencies
4. **Radiation**: Large loops act as antennas, radiating away energy rather than storing it in the magnetic field

In practice, circuits operating at 300 MHz (VHF band, used for FM radio and some television) use:
- Inductances: 10 nH to 1 μH (microwave circuits use even smaller values)
- Capacitances: 0.5 pF to 100 pF
- Often stripline or microstrip transmission line resonators instead of discrete L and C

This "unreasonable results" problem teaches that not all mathematical solutions to the resonance equation correspond to physically realizable circuits.

This is an open-ended problem where you design your own scenario.

<div class="title">
Example Solution
</div>
**Problem Setup**: A home is located 50 m from a high-voltage transmission line. The measured 60-Hz magnetic field at the home is 0.50 μT. A 500-m section of power line is considered. The line carries three-phase AC power at 500 kV.

**Part 1: Intensity of EM Radiation**

Given: $$B_{0}=0.50 \text{ }\mu\text{T}=5.0 \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$I=\frac{cB_{0}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}=\frac{\left(3.00 \times 10^{8}\right)\left(5.0 \times 10^{-7}\right)^{2}}{2\left(4\pi \times 10^{-7}\right)}=\frac{7.5 \times 10^{-5}}{2.513 \times 10^{-6}}=29.8 \text{ W/m}^{2}$$
</div>

**Part 2: Radiated Power from 500-m Section**

If we model the radiation as spreading cylindrically from the line, over a cylindrical surface at radius $$r=50 \text{ m}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$A=2\pi rL=2\pi(50)(500)=1.57 \times 10^{5} \text{ m}^{2}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{rad}}=IA=\left(29.8 \text{ W/m}^{2}\right)\left(1.57 \times 10^{5} \text{ m}^{2}\right)=4.68 \times 10^{6} \text{ W}=4.68 \text{ MW}$$
</div>

**Part 3: Current Estimate**

For a long straight wire, the magnetic field at distance $$r$$ is $$B=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}$$. Solving for current:

<div class="equation">
 $$I=\frac{2\pi rB}{\mu_{0}}=\frac{2\pi(50)\left(5.0 \times 10^{-7}\right)}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}}=\frac{1.57 \times 10^{-4}}{1.257 \times 10^{-6}}=125 \text{ A}$$
</div>

**Part 4: Transmitted Power**

For a three-phase line at 500 kV with 125 A per phase:

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{trans}}=\sqrt{3}VI\cos\phi \approx \sqrt{3}(500{,}000)(125)(0.95)=103 \text{ MW}$$
</div>

(assuming power factor $$\cos\phi=0.95$$)

**Comparison**: The radiated power (4.68 MW) is about 4.5% of the transmitted power (103 MW).

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
**Important caveat**: This calculation vastly overestimates the actual radiated power because 60-Hz electromagnetic waves don't propagate efficiently. At 60 Hz, $$\lambda=c/f=5000 \text{ km}$$, which is enormous. Power lines are much shorter than a wavelength, making them extremely inefficient antennas. The formula $$I=\frac{cB_{0}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}$$ applies to propagating electromagnetic waves, not to the near-field region of a 60-Hz source.

In reality, most of the measured magnetic field near power lines is **quasi-static** (varying slowly at 60 Hz) rather than radiating electromagnetic waves. The electric and magnetic fields exist primarily in the near field, storing energy that oscillates back and forth rather than propagating away. True radiation from power lines is negligible—typical radiated power is measured in watts, not megawatts.

The actual health concerns from power lines relate to the quasi-static fields themselves (if any effects exist), not to EM radiation intensity. Extensive research has found no consistent evidence that 60-Hz magnetic fields at these levels (< 1 μT) cause biological harm, though studies continue.

**Key learning points from this problem**:
1. Not all oscillating fields are radiating waves—frequency and antenna size matter
2. The intensity formula $$I=\frac{cB_{0}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}$$ applies to propagating waves, not near fields
3. Power lines operate in the near-field regime where energy is stored, not radiated
4. Efficient radiation requires antennas comparable to wavelength (λ/4 or λ/2)
5. The measured field strength tells us about current (125 A is reasonable for transmission lines)

**Alternative scenarios you could explore**:
- Different distances (10 m vs 100 m)
- Different field strengths (0.1 μT vs 0.9 μT)
- Different line lengths (100 m vs 1000 m)
- Different voltages and power levels
- Comparison with other radiation sources (cell phones, Wi-Fi)

<div class="title">
Final Answer
</div>
This is a student-designed problem. The example shows that while naive application of the intensity formula gives 29.8 W/m² and suggests MW of radiated power, this is incorrect for 60-Hz quasi-static fields. Real power line radiation is negligible. The exercise illustrates the distinction between near-field energy storage and far-field radiation, and why frequency and antenna size are critical for EM wave propagation.

Dish diameter $$d=45 \text{ cm}=0.45 \text{ m}$$, radius $$r=0.225 \text{ m}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$A_{\text{dish}}=\pi r^{2}=\pi(0.225)^{2}=0.159 \text{ m}^{2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$P_{\text{received}}=I \times A_{\text{dish}}=\left(1.0 \times 10^{-11} \text{ W/m}^{2}\right)(0.159 \text{ m}^{2})=1.59 \times 10^{-12} \text{ W}=1.59 \text{ pW}$$
</div>

**Part 3: Maximum Electric Field Strength**

From $$I=\frac{c\epsilon_{0}E_{0}^{2}}{2}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{2I}{c\epsilon_{0}}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\left(1.0 \times 10^{-11}\right)}{\left(3.00 \times 10^{8}\right)\left(8.85 \times 10^{-12}\right)}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{2.0 \times 10^{-11}}{2.655 \times 10^{-3}}}=\sqrt{7.53 \times 10^{-9}}=8.68 \times 10^{-5} \text{ V/m}=86.8 \text{ }\mu\text{V/m}$$
</div>

**Part 4: Maximum Magnetic Field Strength**

<div class="equation">
 $$B_{0}=\frac{E_{0}}{c}=\frac{8.68 \times 10^{-5} \text{ V/m}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}}=2.89 \times 10^{-13} \text{ T}=289 \text{ fT}$$

Discussion
</div>
The received power of 1.59 picowatts is incredibly small—about 12 orders of magnitude less than a typical LED! Yet satellite TV works because:

1. **Large dish area**: Even a modest 45-cm dish collects signal from 0.159 m² of wavefront
2. **Sensitive receivers**: Low-noise block downconverters (LNBs) at the dish focus can detect signals down to femtowatt levels
3. **Digital modulation**: Modern DVB-S2 encoding with error correction allows signal recovery from very noisy signals
4. **Frequency allocation**: Ku-band (12-18 GHz) and Ka-band (26-40 GHz) satellites use dedicated frequencies with minimal interference
5. **Directional transmission**: Satellites use phased array or shaped reflector antennas to concentrate power toward specific regions, not radiating uniformly

The electric field of 86.8 μV/m is extremely weak—about 10 billion times weaker than the electric field that breaks down air. The magnetic field of 289 femtoteslas is about 100 million times weaker than Earth's magnetic field.

**Why 200 W is sufficient**:
- Each transponder on a satellite typically transmits 50-200 W
- Modern satellites have 24-72 transponders
- Total satellite power: 5-15 kW
- Powered by large solar panel arrays (20-30 m² in orbit)
- Signal is concentrated into specific coverage zones (footprints)

**Comparison with earlier satellite systems**:
- 1970s-1980s: Large dishes (2-3 m diameter) needed because satellites had lower power (5-10 W/transponder) and receivers were less sensitive
- 1990s: Introduction of high-power DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite) with 120-240 W/transponder enabled smaller dishes (60-75 cm)
- 2000s-present: Advanced coding and modulation allow even smaller dishes (45 cm or less)

**Alternative scenarios to explore**:
- Smaller dish (30 cm) for mobile satellite receivers
- Larger dish (60 cm) for better signal in rain (rain fade mitigation)
- Different satellite power (100 W vs 300 W per channel)
- Different coverage areas (spot beam vs continental coverage)
- Different frequencies (C-band at 4-8 GHz vs Ka-band at 26-40 GHz)
- Calculate signal-to-noise ratio needed for reception
- Account for atmospheric absorption (clear sky vs rain)

**Physical insights**:
- The inverse-square law means doubling satellite altitude requires 4× more power or 4× larger dish
- Geosynchronous orbit (36,000 km) is optimal for fixed dishes but has 0.25-second round-trip delay
- Lower orbit satellites (like Starlink at 550 km) have stronger signals but require tracking dishes

Final Answer
</div>
This is a student-designed problem. The example shows that a 45-cm dish receiving from a 200-W satellite transponder covering $$2.0 \times 10^{13}$$ m² receives 1.59 pW of power with an electric field strength of 86.8 μV/m. Despite these incredibly weak signals, modern receiver technology makes reliable satellite TV reception possible through sensitive electronics, large collecting areas, and sophisticated digital signal processing.
