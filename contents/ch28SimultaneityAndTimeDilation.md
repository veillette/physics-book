(credit: Jason Edward Scott  Bain, Flickr)')
{: #Figure1}

Do time intervals depend on who observes them? Intuitively, we expect the time
for a process, such as the elapsed time for a foot race, to be the same for all
observers. Our experience has been that disagreements over elapsed time have to
do with the accuracy of measuring time. When we carefully consider just how time
is measured, however, we will find that elapsed time depends on the relative
motion of an observer with respect to the process being measured.

### Simultaneity

Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do
we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of
light from the event, such as observing a light turning green to start a drag
race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is
used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.

Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes
of light produced by flash lamps. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) Two flash lamps
with observer A midway between them are on a rail car that moves to the right
relative to observer B. Observer B arranges for the light flashes to be emitted
just as A passes B, so that both A and B are equidistant from the lamps when the
light is emitted. Observer B measures the time interval between the arrival of
the light flashes. According to postulate 2, the speed of light is not affected
by the motion of the lamps relative to B. Therefore, light travels equal
distances to him at equal speeds. Thus observer B measures the flashes to be
simultaneous.

![A girl as observer A is sitting down midway on a rail car with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple light rays that are emitted from respective flash lamps towards observer A are shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the rail car is shown towards the right. A male observer B standing on the platform is facing her. Now observer A moves with the lamps on a rail car that is as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the light flashes simultaneously, but he notes that observer A receives the flash from the right first. B observes the flashes to be simultaneous to him but not to A.](../resources/Figure_28_02_02.jpg 'Observer B measures the elapsed time between the arrival of light flashes as described in the text. Observer A moves with the lamps on a rail car. Observer B perceives that the light flashes occurred simultaneously. Observer A perceives that the light on the right flashes before the light on the left.')
{: #Figure2}

Now consider what observer B sees happen to observer A. Observer B perceives
light from the right reaching observer A before light from the left, because she
has moved towards that flash lamp, lessening the distance the light must travel
and reducing the time it takes to get to her. Light travels at speed $$c $$
relative to both observers, but observer B remains equidistant between the
points where the flashes were emitted, while A gets closer to the emission point
on the right. From observer B’s point of view, then, there is a time interval
between the arrival of the flashes to observer A. From observer B’s point of
view, then, there is a time interval between the arrival of the flashes to
observer A. In observer A\'s frame of reference, the flashes occur at different
times. Observer B measures the flashes to arrive simultaneously relative to him
but not relative to A.

Now consider what observer A sees happening. She sees the light from the right
arriving before light from the left. Since both lamps are the same distance from
her in her reference frame, from her perspective, the right flash occurred
before the left flash. Here a relative velocity between observers affects
whether two events are observed to be simultaneous. **Simultaneity is not
absolute**

This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly
that if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the
sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this
not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of **thought
experiment** (in German, “Gedankenexperiment”). He very carefully considered how
an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of
thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius
of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed
his theory of relativity.

In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures
them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events).
Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.

### Time Dilation

The consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to
an important relativistic effect.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Time dilation
</div>
**Time dilation** is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.

</div>

Suppose, for example, an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to cross
her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) How
does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time
measured for the same event by a person on the Earth? Asking this question (
another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed
time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time
measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the Earth-bound
observer. The passage of time is different for the observers because the
distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the
Earth-bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will
take longer to travel the greater distance in the Earth-bound frame.

![For part a, an astronaut is standing inside the spaceship with an electronic timer. The timer is showing the time delta-t-zero. The astronaut has to measure time for an activity which has a mirror, the Sun as a source of light, and a receiver. A ray from the light source is striking the mirror and getting reflected back to the receiver. The distance between the source of light and mirror is given by d. For part b, the same activity is observed by a man standing on Earth. He has an electronic timer showing the time as delta-t. For the observer on earth the activity is fragmented into three portions. In the first portion, the ray of light is travelling a distance of and strikes the mirror in the second portion. The third portion shows the reflected ray of light striking the receiver represented by s and having a vertical distance of d. The horizontal distance L observed by the man from the beginning of the event till the end portion is given as L equals to velocity v into delta t upon two.](../resources/Figure_28_02_03.jpg '(a) An astronaut measures the time ( \\Delta t_0 ) for light to cross her ship using an electronic timer. Light travels a distance 2D in the astronaut’s frame. (b) A person on the Earth sees the light follow the longer path 2s and take a longer time ( \\Delta t ) . (c) These triangles are used to find the relationship between the two distances 2D and 2s.')
{: #Figure3}

To quantitatively verify that time depends on the observer, consider the paths
followed by light as seen by each observer. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(c).) The
astronaut sees the light travel straight across and back for a total distance of
$$2D $$ , twice the width of her ship. The Earth-bound observer sees the light
travel a total distance $$2s $$ . Since the ship is moving at speed $$v $$ to
the right relative to the Earth, light moving to the right hits the mirror in
this frame. Light travels at a speed $$c $$ in both frames, and because time is
the distance divided by speed, the time measured by the astronaut is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta {t}_{0}=\frac{2D}{c}. $$
</div>

This time has a separate name to distinguish it from the time measured by the
Earth-bound observer.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
**Proper Time**
</div>
<strong class="term" >Proper time </strong> $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$
 is the time measured by an observer at rest relative to the event being observed.

</div>

In the case of the astronaut observe the reflecting light, the astronaut
measures proper time. The time measured by the Earth-bound observer is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta t=\frac{2s}{c}. $$
</div>

To find the relationship between $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ and $$\Delta t $$ ,
consider the triangles formed by $$D $$ and $$s $$ .
(See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(c).) The third side of these similar triangles is
$$L $$ , the distance the astronaut moves as the light goes across her ship. In
the frame of the Earth-bound observer,

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{v\Delta t}{2}. $$
</div>

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance $$s $$ is found to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$s=\sqrt{ {D}^{2}+{\left(\frac{v\Delta t}{2}\right)}^{2}}. $$
</div>

Substituting $$s $$ into the expression for the time interval $$\Delta t $$
gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta t=\frac{2s}{c}=\frac{2\sqrt{ {D}^{2}+{\left(\frac{v\Delta t}{2}\right)}^{2}}}{c}. $$
</div>

We square this equation, which yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}=\frac{4{\left( {D}^{2}+\frac{ {v}^{2}\left(\Delta t \right)}^{2}}{4}\right)}{ {c}^{2}}=\frac{ {4D}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}+\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}{\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}. $$
</div>

Note that if we square the first expression we had for $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ , we
get $${\left( \Delta {t}_{0} \right)}^{2}=\frac{ {4D}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}} $$ . This
term appears in the preceding equation, giving us a means to relate the two time
intervals. Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}={\left( \Delta {t}_{0} \right)}^{2}+\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}{\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}. $$
</div>

Gathering terms, we solve for $$\Delta t $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}{\left( 1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}\right)=\left(\Delta {t}_{0} \right)}^{2}. $$
</div>

Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\left( \Delta t \right)}^{2}=\frac{ {\left( \Delta {t}_{0} \right)}^{2}}{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}. $$
</div>

Taking the square root yields an important relationship between elapsed times:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta t=\frac{\Delta {t}_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}={\gamma \Delta t}_{0}, $$
</div>

where

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}. $$
</div>

This equation for $$\Delta t $$ is truly remarkable. First, as contended,
elapsed time is not the same for different observers moving relative to one
another, even though both are in inertial frames. Proper time $$\Delta {t}\_{0}

$$
measured by an observer, like the astronaut moving with the apparatus, is
smaller than time measured by other observers. Since those other observers
measure a longer time $$\Delta t $$ , the effect is called time dilation. The
Earth-bound observer sees time dilate (get longer) for a system moving relative
to the Earth. Alternatively, according to the Earth-bound observer, time slows
in the moving frame, since less time passes there. All clocks moving relative to
an observer, including biological clocks such as aging, are observed to run slow
compared with a clock stationary relative to the observer.

Note that if the relative velocity is much less than the speed of light ( $$v
\ll c $$ ), then $$\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}} $$ is extremely small, and the
elapsed times $$\Delta t $$ and $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ are nearly equal. At low
velocities, modern relativity approaches classical physics—our everyday
experiences have very small relativistic effects.

The equation $$\Delta t={\gamma \Delta t}_{0} $$ also implies that relative
velocity cannot exceed the speed of light. As $$v $$ approaches $$c $$ ,
$$\Delta t $$ approaches infinity. This would imply that time in the astronaut’s
frame stops at the speed of light. If $$v $$ exceeded $$c $$ , then we would be
taking the square root of a negative number, producing an imaginary value for
$$\Delta t $$.

There is considerable experimental evidence that the equation $$\Delta t={\gamma
\Delta t}_{0} $$ is correct. One example is found in cosmic ray particles that
continuously rain down on the Earth from deep space. Some collisions of these
particles with nuclei in the upper atmosphere result in short-lived particles
called muons. The half-life (amount of time for half of a material to decay) of
a muon is $$ 1.52 \mu \text{s} $$ when it is at rest relative to the observer
who measures the half-life. This is the proper time $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ . Muons
produced by cosmic ray particles have a range of velocities, with some moving
near the speed of light. It has been found that the muon’s half-life as measured
by an Earth-bound observer ( $$\Delta t $$ )
varies with velocity exactly as predicted by the equation $$\Delta t={\gamma
\Delta t}_{0} $$ . The faster the muon moves, the longer it lives. We on the
Earth see the muon’s half-life time dilated—as viewed from our frame, the muon
decays more slowly than it does when at rest relative to us.

Calculating
 $$\Delta t $$
for a Relativistic Event: How Long Does a Speedy Muon Live?
</div>
Suppose a cosmic ray colliding with a nucleus in the Earth’s upper atmosphere produces a muon that has a velocity  $$v= 0.950c $$ .
 The muon then travels at constant velocity and lives  $$ 1.52 \mu \text{s} $$
 as measured in the muon’s frame of reference. (You can imagine this as the muon’s internal clock.) How long does the muon live as measured by an Earth-bound observer? (See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).)

**Strategy**

A clock moving with the system being measured observes the proper time, so the
time we are given is $$\Delta {t}_{0}= 1.52 \mu \text{s} $$ . The Earth-bound
observer measures $$\Delta t $$ as given by the equation $$\Delta t={\gamma
\Delta t}_{0} $$ . Since we know the velocity, the calculation is
straightforward.

**Solution**

1) Identify the knowns. $$v= 0.950c $$ , $$\Delta {t}_{0}= 1.52 \mu \text{s} $$
2) Identify the unknown. $$\Delta t $$
3) Choose the appropriate equation.

Use,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta t={\gamma \Delta t}_{0}, $$
</div>
where

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}. $$
</div>
4) Plug the knowns into the equation.

First find $$\gamma $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\gamma & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\\ & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {\left( 0.950c \right)}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\\ & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\left( 0.950 \right)}^{2}}}\\ & =& 3.20.\end{array} $$
</div>
Use the calculated value of  $$\gamma  $$
 to determine  $$\Delta t $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta t& =& {\gamma \Delta t}_{0}\\ & =& \left(3.20\right)\left(1.52 \mu \text{s}\right)\\ & =& 4.87 \mu \text{s}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

One implication of this example is that since $$\gamma = 3.20 $$ at $$ 95.0\% $$
of the speed of light ( $$v= 0.950c $$ ), the relativistic effects are
significant. The two time intervals differ by this factor of 3.20, where
classically they would be the same. Something moving at $$ 0.950c $$ is said to
be highly relativistic.

</div>

Another implication of the preceding example is that everything an astronaut
does when moving at $$ 95.0\% $$ of the speed of light relative to the Earth
takes 3.20 times longer when observed from the Earth. Does the astronaut sense
this? Only if she looks outside her spaceship. All methods of measuring time in
her frame will be affected by the same factor of 3.20. This includes her
wristwatch, heart rate, cell metabolism rate, nerve impulse rate, and so on. She
will have no way of telling, since all of her clocks will agree with one another
because their relative velocities are zero. Motion is relative, not absolute.
But what if she does look out the window?

Real-World Connections

It may seem that special relativity has little effect on your life, but it is probably more important than you realize. One of the most common effects is through the Global Positioning System (GPS). Emergency vehicles, package delivery services, electronic maps, and communications devices are just a few of the common uses of GPS, and the GPS system could not work without taking into account relativistic effects. GPS satellites rely on precise time measurements to communicate. The signals travel at relativistic speeds. Without corrections for time dilation, the satellites could not communicate, and the GPS system would fail within minutes.

</div>

### The Twin Paradox

An intriguing consequence of time dilation is that a space traveler moving at a
high velocity relative to the Earth would age less than her Earth-bound twin.
Imagine the astronaut moving at such a velocity that $$\gamma = 30.0 $$ , as
in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). A trip that takes 2.00 years in her frame would take
60.0 years in her Earth-bound twin’s frame. Suppose the astronaut traveled 1.00
year to another star system. She briefly explored the area, and then traveled
1.00 year back. If the astronaut was 40 years old when she left, she would be 42
upon her return. Everything on the Earth, however, would have aged 60.0 years.
Her twin, if still alive, would be 100 years old.

The situation would seem different to the astronaut. Because motion is relative,
the spaceship would seem to be stationary and the Earth would appear to move. (
This is the sensation you have when flying in a jet.) If the astronaut looks out
the window of the spaceship, she will see time slow down on the Earth by a
factor of $$\gamma = 30.0 $$ . To her, the Earth-bound sister will have aged
only 2/30 (1/15) of a year, while she aged 2.00 years. The two sisters cannot
both be correct.

![There are two sections in this figure. In the first section a young woman is shown standing on the Earth and her twin is standing in a traveling spaceship. There is a clock beside each of the women showing equal time. In the second section of the figure it is shown that the traveling twin ages less than the Earth-bound twin and the Earth-bound twin is looking older. In the clocks it is shown that on Earth time runs faster than on the traveling spaceship.](../resources/Figure_28_02_05.jpg "The twin paradox asks why the traveling twin ages less than the Earth-bound twin. That is the prediction we obtain if we consider the Earth-bound twin&#x2019;s frame. In the astronaut&#x2019;s frame, however, the Earth is moving and time runs slower there. Who is correct?")
{: #Figure5}

As with all paradoxes, the premise is faulty and leads to contradictory
conclusions. In fact, the astronaut’s motion is significantly different from
that of the Earth-bound twin. The astronaut accelerates to a high velocity and
then decelerates to view the star system. To return to the Earth, she again
accelerates and decelerates. The Earth-bound twin does not experience these
accelerations. So the situation is not symmetric, and it is not correct to claim
that the astronaut will observe the same effects as her Earth-bound twin. If you
use special relativity to examine the twin paradox, you must keep in mind that
the theory is expressly based on inertial frames, which by definition are not
accelerated or rotating. Einstein developed general relativity to deal with
accelerated frames and with gravity, a prime source of acceleration. You can
also use general relativity to address the twin paradox and, according to
general relativity, the astronaut will age less. Some important conceptual
aspects of general relativity are discussed
in [General Relativity and Quantum Gravity](../contents/ch34GeneralRelativityAndQuantumTheory) of this course.

In 1971, American physicists Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating verified time
dilation at low relative velocities by flying extremely accurate atomic clocks
around the Earth on commercial aircraft. They measured elapsed time to an
accuracy of a few nanoseconds and compared it with the time measured by clocks
left behind. Hafele and Keating’s results were within experimental uncertainties
of the predictions of relativity. Both special and general relativity had to be
taken into account, since gravity and accelerations were involved as well as
relative motion.

### Section Summary

- Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as
  occurring at the same time. They are not necessarily simultaneous to all
  observers—simultaneity is not absolute.
- Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is
  moving relative to another observer.
- Observers moving at a relative velocity $$v $$ do not measure the same elapsed
  time for an event. Proper time $$\Delta {t}_{0} $$ is the time measured by an
  observer at rest relative to the event being observed. Proper time is related
  to the time $$\Delta t $$ measured by an Earth-bound observer by the equation

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\Delta t=\frac{ {\Delta t}_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}={\gamma \Delta t}_{0}, $$
  </div>
     where   
  <div class="equation" >
   $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}. $$
  </div>

- The equation relating proper time and time measured by an Earth-bound observer
  implies that relative velocity cannot exceed the speed of light.
- The twin paradox asks why a twin traveling at a relativistic speed away and
  then back towards the Earth ages less than the Earth-bound twin. The premise
  to the paradox is faulty because the traveling twin is accelerating. Special
  relativity does not apply to accelerating frames of reference.
- Time dilation is usually negligible at low relative velocities, but it does
  occur, and it has been verified by experiment.

(a) What is  $$\gamma  $$
 if  $$v= 0.250c $$ ?
 (b) If  $$v= 0.500c $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the definition of the relativistic factor $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ and substitute the given velocities to calculate the Lorentz factor for each case.

**Solution**

(a) For $$v = 0.250c$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.250c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.0625}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.9375}} = \frac{1}{0.9682} = 1.033$$
</div>

(b) For $$v = 0.500c$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.500c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.2500}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.7500}} = \frac{1}{0.8660} = 1.15$$
</div>

**Discussion**

At 25% the speed of light, $$\gamma = 1.033$$, representing only a 3.3% increase from the non-relativistic value of 1. Time dilation and length contraction effects would be barely noticeable. However, at 50% the speed of light, $$\gamma = 1.15$$, meaning time dilation effects become significant—clocks would run 15% slower. This illustrates how relativistic effects increase rapidly as velocity approaches $$c$$. The difference between $$\gamma$$ values at 25% and 50% of $$c$$ is substantial, showing the non-linear nature of relativistic effects.

(a) What is  $$\gamma  $$
 if  $$v= 0.100c $$ ?
 (b) If  $$v= 0.900c $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the definition of the relativistic factor $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ and substitute the given velocities to calculate the Lorentz factor for each case.

**Solution**

(a) For $$v = 0.100c$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.100c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.0100}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.9900}} = \frac{1}{0.9950} = 1.005$$

(b) For $$v = 0.900c$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.900c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.8100}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.1900}} = \frac{1}{0.4359} = 2.29$$

**Discussion**

At 10% the speed of light, relativistic effects are very small—$$\gamma$$ differs from 1 by only 0.5%. However, at 90% the speed of light, $$\gamma = 2.29$$, meaning time dilation effects are significant. A clock moving at $$0.900c$$ would run at less than half the rate of a stationary clock. This dramatic difference illustrates why relativistic effects become important only at very high velocities approaching the speed of light.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The pion's rest lifetime ($$2.60 \times 10^{-8}$$ s) is the proper time $$\Delta t_0$$. The laboratory observes the dilated time $$\Delta t$$. Use $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$ where $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$.

**Solution**

First, calculate $$\gamma$$ for $$v = 2.70 \times 10^8$$ m/s:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(2.70 \times 10^8)^2}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{7.29 \times 10^{16}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}}}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.810}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.190}} = \frac{1}{0.4359} = 2.294$$
</div>

Now calculate the observed lifetime:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 = (2.294)(2.60 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}) = 5.96 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The pion lives about 2.3 times longer as observed in the laboratory compared to its rest frame. This time dilation allows the pion to travel much farther before decaying: $$d = v\Delta t = (2.70 \times 10^8)(5.96 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 16.1$$ m in the lab frame, versus only about 7 m if there were no time dilation. This extended lifetime is crucial for detecting short-lived particles in accelerator experiments. The velocity $$v = 0.900c$$ places this pion firmly in the relativistic regime, where classical mechanics would give completely incorrect predictions for its range and detection probability.

Suppose a particle called a kaon is created by cosmic radiation striking the atmosphere. It moves by you at  $$ 0.980c $$ ,
 and it lives  $$ 1.24 \times 10^{-8}  \text{s} $$
 when at rest relative to an observer. How long does it live as you observe it?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The kaon's lifetime when at rest ($$1.24 \times 10^{-8}$$ s) is the proper time $$\Delta t_0$$. We need to find the dilated time $$\Delta t$$ as observed by someone relative to whom the kaon is moving at $$0.980c$$. Use $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$.

**Solution**

First, calculate $$\gamma$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.980c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.9604}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0396}} = \frac{1}{0.1990} = 5.03$$

Now calculate the observed lifetime:

$$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 = (5.03)(1.24 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}) = 6.23 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}$$

**Discussion**

The kaon lives about 5 times longer when observed from our frame compared to its rest frame. This time dilation allows the kaon to travel much farther through the atmosphere than it could if it lived only $$1.24 \times 10^{-8}$$ s at its high velocity. From the Earth observer's perspective, the kaon travels a distance $$d = v \Delta t = (0.980)(3.00 \times 10^8)(6.23 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 18.3$$ m, whereas without time dilation it would travel only about 3.6 m before decaying. This time dilation is crucial for detecting such particles at ground level.

A neutral  $$\pi  $$

 when at rest relative to an observer, what is its velocity relative to the laboratory?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The particle's rest lifetime is the proper time $$\Delta t_0 = 0.840 \times 10^{-16}$$ s, and the laboratory measures $$\Delta t = 1.40 \times 10^{-16}$$ s. From $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$, we can find $$\gamma$$, then solve for velocity using $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$.

**Solution**

First, calculate $$\gamma$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t_0} = \frac{1.40 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s}}{0.840 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s}} = 1.667$$
</div>

Now use the definition of $$\gamma$$ to find $$v$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
</div>

Squaring both sides:

<div class="equation">
$$\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$
</div>

Rearranging:

<div class="equation">
$$1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{(1.667)^2} = \frac{1}{2.779} = 0.3600$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3600 = 0.6400$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$v = c\sqrt{0.6400} = 0.800c$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The neutral pion must be traveling at 80% the speed of light for its lifetime to be extended from 0.840 to 1.40 × 10⁻¹⁶ s—a factor of $$\gamma = 1.667$$. At this velocity, time dilation effects are substantial. Even though the pion's rest lifetime is incredibly short (less than a trillionth of a microsecond), time dilation allows it to travel a measurable distance: $$d = v\Delta t = (0.800)(3.00 \times 10^8)(1.40 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-8}$$ m or 34 nanometers in the lab frame. Without relativistic time dilation, we could not explain how such short-lived particles travel detectable distances in accelerator experiments.

A neutron lives 900 s when at rest relative to an observer. How fast is the neutron moving relative to an observer who measures its life span to be 2065 s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The neutron's rest lifetime (900 s) is the proper time $$\Delta t_0$$, and the observed lifetime (2065 s) is the dilated time $$\Delta t$$. From $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$, we can find $$\gamma$$, then solve for the velocity $$v$$.

**Solution**

First, find $$\gamma$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t_0} = \frac{2065 \text{ s}}{900 \text{ s}} = 2.294$$

Now use the definition of $$\gamma$$ to find $$v$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

Squaring both sides:

$$\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

Rearranging:

$$1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(2.294)^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{5.263} = 1 - 0.1900 = 0.8100$$

$$\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{0.8100} = 0.900$$

$$v = 0.900c$$

**Discussion**

The neutron must be moving at 90% the speed of light for its lifetime to be extended from 900 s to 2065 s—more than double its rest lifetime. This illustrates the substantial time dilation that occurs at velocities close to the speed of light. Such relativistic neutrons are produced in cosmic ray showers and in particle accelerators. The factor of 2.3 in lifetime extension corresponds exactly to $$\gamma = 2.294$$ for this velocity, confirming the consistency of special relativity.

Given $$\gamma = 1.01$$, use the definition $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ and solve for $$v$$.

<div class="equation">
$$v = c\sqrt{0.0197} = 0.140c$$

**Discussion**

At approximately 14% the speed of light, relativistic effects reach 1%. This corresponds to a velocity of about $$4.2 \times 10^7$$ m/s or 42,000 km/s. For reference, this is much faster than any macroscopic object humans have ever created—the fastest spacecraft travel at only about 0.01% the speed of light. However, subatomic particles in accelerators and cosmic rays routinely exceed this speed. The 1% threshold is often used as a practical criterion for when classical mechanics begins to give slightly inaccurate results that might matter for precision measurements. Below this speed ($$v < 0.14c$$), relativistic corrections are less than 1% and can often be neglected for practical calculations.

**Strategy**

Given $$\gamma = 1.03$$, use the definition $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ and solve for $$v$$.

**Solution**

Starting with:

$$1.03 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

Square both sides:

$$(1.03)^2 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$1.0609 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

Inverting:

$$1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{1.0609} = 0.9426$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.9426 = 0.0574$$

$$\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{0.0574} = 0.2396$$

$$v = 0.240c$$

**Discussion**

At approximately 24% the speed of light, relativistic effects reach 3%. This corresponds to a velocity of about $$7.2 \times 10^7$$ m/s or 72,000 km/s. For reference, this is much faster than any macroscopic object humans have ever created—the fastest spacecraft travel at only about 0.01% the speed of light.

**Discussion**

Part (a) shows that $$\gamma = 1.5$$ (50% time dilation) occurs at about 74.5% the speed of light. At this velocity, clocks run at two-thirds their normal rate. Part (b) demonstrates extreme relativistic effects: at $$\gamma = 100$$, the velocity is 99.995% of $$c$$—incredibly close to the speed of light. At this speed, time dilation is dramatic: a clock moving at this speed would tick 100 times slower than a stationary clock. The difference between 0.745c and 0.99995c seems modest (about 25% of $$c$$), but the time dilation factor increases from 1.5 to 100—nearly 67-fold! This illustrates how $$\gamma$$ grows increasingly steep as $$v$$ approaches $$c$$, making it progressively harder to accelerate particles to higher speeds. Such extreme velocities ($$\gamma = 100$$) are routinely achieved in particle accelerators like CERN's LHC, where protons reach energies corresponding to $$\gamma > 7000$$.

**Strategy**

For both parts, use $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ and solve for $$v$$ in terms of $$c$$.

**Solution**

(a) For $$\gamma = 2.00$$:

$$2.00 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

Squaring both sides:

$$4.00 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{4.00} = 0.250$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.250 = 0.750$$

$$v = c\sqrt{0.750} = 0.866c$$

(b) For $$\gamma = 10.0$$:

$$10.0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

Squaring both sides:

$$100 = \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

$$1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.0100$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.0100 = 0.9900$$

$$v = c\sqrt{0.9900} = 0.995c$$

**Discussion**

Part (a) shows that $$\gamma = 2$$ (a doubling of time dilation) occurs at about 87% the speed of light. At this velocity, moving clocks run at half speed, and lengths contract to half their proper length. Part (b) shows that even at $$\gamma = 10$$ (extreme time dilation), the velocity is "only" 99.5% of $$c$$—not quite the speed of light. This illustrates how $$\gamma$$ increases very rapidly as $$v$$ approaches $$c$$. The difference between 0.866c and 0.995c seems small (about 13% of $$c$$), but the time dilation factor increases five-fold from 2 to 10. This increasingly steep relationship makes it progressively harder to accelerate particles to higher and higher fractions of the speed of light.
