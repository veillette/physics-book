Most medical and related applications of nuclear physics are driven, at their core, by the difference between a radioactive substance and a non-radioactive substance. One of the first such methods is the precision measurement and detection method known as radioimmunoassay (RIA). Developed by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s, RIA relies on the principle of competitive binding. For the particular substance being measured, a sample containing a radioactive isotope is prepared. A known quantity of antibodies is then introduced. By measuring the amount of "unbound" antibodies after the reaction, technicians can detect and measure the precise amount of the target substance. Radioimmunoassay is essential in cancer screening, hepatitis diagnosis, narcotics investigation, and other analyses.

A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes
nuclear radiation so useful? First, $$\gamma $$ radiation can easily penetrate
tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body.
Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical
compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound
designed for specific purposes. The compound is said to be **tagged**. A tagged
compound used for medical purposes is called a **radiopharmaceutical**{: class="
term"}. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and
concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information.
For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and
this information can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical
which the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to
detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such
bone scans. Radioisotopes are also used to determine the functioning of body
organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the
thyroid gland.

### Medical Application

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists certain medical diagnostic uses of
radiopharmaceuticals, including isotopes and activities that are typically
administered. Many organs can be imaged with a variety of nuclear isotopes
replacing a stable element by a radioactive isotope. One common diagnostic
employs iodine to image the thyroid, since iodine is concentrated in that organ.
The most active thyroid cells, including cancerous cells, concentrate the most
iodine and, therefore, emit the most radiation. Conversely, hypothyroidism is
indicated by lack of iodine uptake. Note that there is more than one isotope
that can be used for several types of scans. Another common nuclear diagnostic
is the thallium scan for the cardiovascular system, particularly used to
evaluate blockages in the coronary arteries and examine heart activity. The salt
TlCl can be used, because it acts like NaCl and follows the blood. Gallium-67
accumulates where there is rapid cell growth, such as in tumors and sites of
infection. Hence, it is useful in cancer imaging. Usually, the patient receives
the injection one day and has a whole body scan 3 or 4 days later because it can
take several days for the gallium to build up.

Note that [[Table 1]](#Table1) lists many diagnostic uses for $${}^{99
\text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ , where “m” stands for a metastable state of the
technetium nucleus. Perhaps 80 percent of all radiopharmaceutical procedures
employ $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ because of its many advantages. One is
that the decay of its metastable state produces a single, easily identified
0.142-MeV $$\gamma $$ ray. Additionally, the radiation dose to the patient is
limited by the short 6.0-h half-life of $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ . And,
although its half-life is short, it is easily and continuously produced on site.
The basic process for production is neutron activation of molybdenum, which
quickly $$\beta $$ decays into $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ . Technetium-99m
can be attached to many compounds to allow the imaging of the skeleton, heart,
lungs, kidneys, etc.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows one of the simpler methods of imaging the
concentration of nuclear activity, employing a device called an **Anger camera**
or **gamma camera**. A piece of lead with holes bored through it collimates
$$\gamma $$ rays emerging from the patient, allowing detectors to receive
$$\gamma $$ rays from specific directions only. The computer analysis of
detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection
method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a
two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view),
because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.

![The image shows the head of a man scanned by an Anger camera. The camera consists of a lead collimator and array of detectors. Gamma rays emerging from the man’s head pass through the lead collimator and produce light flashes in the scintillators. The photomultiplier tubes convert the light output to electrical signals for computer image generation.](../resources/Figure_32_01_02.jpg 'An Anger or gamma camera consists of a lead collimator and an array of detectors. Gamma rays produce light flashes in the scintillators. The light output is converted to an electrical signal by the photomultipliers. A computer constructs an image from the detector output.')
{: #Figure2}

Imaging techniques much like those in x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans use
nuclear activity in patients to form three-dimensional
images. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a patient in a circular array of detectors
that may be stationary or rotated, with detector output used by a computer to
construct a detailed image. This technique is called **single-photon-emission
computed tomography(SPECT)** or sometimes simply SPET. The spatial resolution of
this technique is poor, about 1 cm, but the contrast (i.e. the difference in
visual properties that makes an object distinguishable from other objects and
the background) is good.

![A man lying down, going through a cylindrical scanning machine.](../resources/Figure_32_01_03.jpg 'SPECT uses a geometry similar to a CT scanner to form an image of the concentration of a radiopharmaceutical compound. (credit: Woldo, Wikimedia Commons)')
{: #Figure3}

Images produced by $${\beta }^{+} $$ emitters have become important in recent
years. When the emitted positron (  $${\beta }^{+} $$ )
encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two $$\gamma $$
rays. These $$\gamma $$ rays have identical 0.511-MeV energies (the energy comes
from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly
away from one another, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin
accurately, as shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). The system is called **positron
emission tomography (PET)**. It requires detectors on opposite sides to
simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511-MeV energy and
utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans.
Examples of $${\beta }^{+} $$ -emitting isotopes used in PET are
$${}^{11}\text{C} $$ , $${}^{13}\text{N} $$ , $${}^{15}\text{O} $$ , and
$${}^{18}\text{F} $$ , as seen in [[Table 1]](#Table1). This list includes C, N,
and O, and so they have the advantage of being able to function as tags for
natural body compounds. Its resolution of 0.5 cm is better than that of SPECT;
the accuracy and sensitivity of PET scans make them useful for examining the
brain's anatomy and function. The brain's use of oxygen and water can be
monitored with $${}^{15}\text{O} $$ . PET is used extensively for diagnosing
brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions prior to a
confirmation of Alzheimer's disease. PET can locate regions in the brain that
become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking,
closing their eyes, and so on.

![The figure shows a patient undergoing a scan in a cylindrical device. The P E T system uses two gamma ray photons produced by positron electron annihilation. These gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.](../resources/Figure_32_01_04.jpg 'A PET system takes advantage of the two identical ( \\gamma )-ray photons produced by positron-electron annihilation. These ( \\gamma ) rays are emitted in opposite directions, so that the line along which each pair is emitted is determined. Various events detected by several pairs of detectors are then analyzed by the computer to form an accurate image.')

Neutrons from a source (perhaps the one discussed in the preceding problem) bombard natural molybdenum, which is 24 percent  $${}^{98}\text{Mo} $$ .
 What is the energy output of the reaction  $${}^{98}\text{Mo}+n\to {}^{99}\text{Mo}+\gamma  $$ ?
The mass of  $${}^{98}\text{Mo} $$ is given in [Appendix A: Atomic Masses](../contents/appendixA), and that of  $${}^{99}\text{Mo} $$
 is 98.907711 u.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy released in this neutron capture reaction is found from the mass defect: $$E = (\Delta m)c^{2}$$, where $$\Delta m = m_{\text{reactants}} - m_{\text{products}}$$. We need to look up the mass of $${}^{98}\text{Mo}$$ from Appendix A (97.905406 u) and use the given mass of $${}^{99}\text{Mo}$$ (98.907711 u). The neutron mass is 1.008665 u.

**Solution**

Calculate the total mass of reactants:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{reactants}} = m({}^{98}\text{Mo}) + m(n) = 97.905406 \text{ u} + 1.008665 \text{ u} = 98.914071 \text{ u} $$
</div>

The mass of the product is:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{products}} = m({}^{99}\text{Mo}) = 98.907711 \text{ u} $$
</div>

Calculate the mass defect:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta m = 98.914071 \text{ u} - 98.907711 \text{ u} = 0.006360 \text{ u} $$
</div>

Convert to energy:

<div class="equation">
$$ E = (\Delta m)c^{2} = (0.006360 \text{ u})\left(\frac{931.5 \text{ MeV}}{1 \text{ u}}\right) = 5.93 \text{ MeV} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This 5.93 MeV of energy is released as a gamma ray (or possibly multiple gamma rays that sum to this energy). Neutron capture reactions like this are exothermic because the product nucleus has greater binding energy than the sum of the reactants. This particular reaction is extremely important in nuclear medicine because it is the first step in producing $${}^{99\text{m}}\text{Tc}$$, the most widely used radiopharmaceutical. The $${}^{99}\text{Mo}$$ produced undergoes beta decay with a half-life of 66 hours to form $${}^{99\text{m}}\text{Tc}$$, which has ideal properties for medical imaging: a 6-hour half-life that limits patient dose, and emission of a single easily-detected 0.142-MeV gamma ray. The fact that natural molybdenum is 24% $${}^{98}\text{Mo}$$ means that natural molybdenum can be used directly as a target material in reactors without expensive isotopic enrichment. The relatively large energy release of nearly 6 MeV helps ensure a reasonable reaction probability (cross-section) when thermal neutrons are used, making this a practical production method. This reaction is performed continuously in nuclear reactors around the world to supply $${}^{99}\text{Mo}$$/$${}^{99\text{m}}\text{Tc}$$ generators to hospitals and clinics.

(a) Two annihilation  $$\gamma  $$
 rays in a PET scan originate at the same point and travel to detectors on either side of the patient. If the point of origin is 9.00 cm closer to one of the detectors, what is the difference in arrival times of the photons? (This could be used to give position information, but the time difference is small enough to make it difficult.)

(b) How accurately would you need to be able to measure arrival time differences
to get a position resolution of 1.00 mm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Gamma rays (photons) travel at the speed of light $$c = 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$. The time difference is found from $$\Delta t = \Delta d / c$$, where $$\Delta d$$ is the difference in distance traveled. For part (a), $$\Delta d = 9.00 \text{ cm}$$. For part (b), we need $$\Delta d = 1.00 \text{ mm}$$ resolution.

**Solution**

(a) Convert distance to meters and calculate time difference:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta d = 9.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0900 \text{ m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta t = \frac{\Delta d}{c} = \frac{0.0900 \text{ m}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 3.00 \times 10^{-10} \text{ s} = 0.300 \text{ ns} $$
</div>

(b) For 1.00 mm resolution:

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta d = 1.00 \text{ mm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta t = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 3.33 \times 10^{-12} \text{ s} = 3.33 \text{ ps} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

These incredibly short time intervals illustrate both the potential and the challenge of using time-of-flight information in PET imaging. In part (a), the time difference of 0.300 nanoseconds for a 9-cm offset is at the edge of what modern electronics can reliably measure. Current state-of-the-art PET scanners can achieve timing resolution of about 200-500 picoseconds, which would give position resolution of about 3-7.5 cm. To achieve the 1-mm resolution specified in part (b) would require measuring time differences of only 3.33 picoseconds—more than 60 times better than current technology! This is why conventional PET relies primarily on coincidence detection (detecting that two photons arrived at nearly the same time on opposite detectors) rather than precise time-of-flight measurements. The coincidence requirement determines that the photons came from somewhere along the line connecting the two detectors, and computer tomography techniques reconstruct the image from many such lines. Modern "time-of-flight PET" (TOF-PET) scanners do use the achievable ~200-500 ps timing resolution to narrow down the position along each line to about 3-7 cm, which significantly improves image quality and reduces scanning time. However, the fundamental spatial resolution of PET (about 4-6 mm) is still limited by other factors including positron range (the distance the positron travels before annihilation) and photon non-collinearity (the annihilation photons aren't exactly 180° apart due to the momentum of the positron-electron pair).

The $${}^{131}\text{I}$$ mass is about **11 times larger** than the $${}^{123}\text{I}$$ mass.

**Discussion**

Despite $${}^{123}\text{I}$$ having higher activity (70 μCi vs 50 μCi), it requires much less mass (only 0.036 ng compared to 0.405 ng for $${}^{131}\text{I}$$). This factor of 11 difference is primarily due to the vastly different half-lives: $${}^{131}\text{I}$$ has a half-life of 8.04 days while $${}^{123}\text{I}$$ has a much shorter half-life of only 13.2 hours. Shorter half-life means more decays per second for a given number of nuclei, so less mass is needed to achieve a given activity. This illustrates an important principle: to achieve high activity with less mass (and therefore potentially less total radiation dose), isotopes with shorter half-lives are preferred. Both masses are incredibly small—in the nanogram range—which is why carrier-free radiopharmaceuticals cannot be used directly. Without adding stable iodine as a carrier, these tiny amounts would stick to container walls, fail to dissolve properly, and not distribute normally in the body. The carrier ensures that the radioiodine behaves chemically like normal iodine and concentrates in the thyroid as expected. The shorter half-life of $${}^{123}\text{I}$$ (13.2 h vs 8.04 d) also means the patient's radiation dose decays away much faster, making $${}^{123}\text{I}$$ preferable when available, despite being more expensive and difficult to produce.
