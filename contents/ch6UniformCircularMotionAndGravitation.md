Many motions, such as the arc of a bird’s flight or Earth’s path around the Sun,
are curved. Recall that Newton’s first law tells us that motion is along a
straight line at constant speed unless there is a net external force. We will
therefore study not only motion along curves, but also the forces that cause it,
including gravitational forces. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation
of [Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics) as we study
more applications of Newton’s laws of motion.

This chapter deals with the simplest form of curved motion, **uniform circular
motion**, motion in a circular path at constant speed. Studying this topic
illustrates most concepts associated with rotational motion and leads to the
study of many new topics we group under the name *rotation*. Pure
*rotational motion* occurs when points in an object move in circular paths
centered on one point. Pure *translational motion* is motion with no rotation.
Some motion combines both types, such as a rotating hockey puck moving along
ice.
