In this section, we continue to explore the thermal behavior of gases. In
particular, we examine the characteristics of atoms and molecules that compose
gases. (Most gases, for example nitrogen, $${\text{N}}_{2} $$ , and oxygen,
$${\text{O}}\_{2} $$ , are composed of two or more atoms. We will primarily use
the term “molecule” in discussing a gas because the term can also be applied to
monatomic gases, such as helium.)

Gases are easily compressed. We can see evidence of this
in [[Table 1]](../contents/ch13ThermalExpansionOfSolidsAndLiquids#Table1),
where you will note that gases have the _largest_ coefficients of volume
expansion. The large coefficients mean that gases expand and contract very
rapidly with temperature changes. In addition, you will note that most gases
expand at the _same_ rate, or have the same $$\beta $$ . This raises the
question as to why gases should all act in nearly the same way, when liquids and
solids have widely varying expansion rates.

The answer lies in the large separation of atoms and molecules in gases,
compared to their sizes, as illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Because atoms
and molecules have large separations, forces between them can be ignored, except
when they collide with each other during collisions. The motion of atoms and
molecules (at temperatures well above the boiling temperature) is fast, such
that the gas occupies all of the accessible volume and the expansion of gases is
rapid. In contrast, in liquids and solids, atoms and molecules are closer
together and are quite sensitive to the forces between them.

![Spheres representing atoms and molecules; the spheres are relatively far apart and are distributed randomly.](../resources/Figure_13_03_02.jpg 'Atoms and molecules in a gas are typically widely separated, as shown. Because the forces between them are quite weak at these distances, the properties of a gas depend more on the number of atoms per unit volume and on temperature than on the type of atom.')
{: #Figure2}

To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related
to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into an initially
deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the
amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the
tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If
we continue to pump air into it, the pressure increases. The pressure will
further increase when the car is driven and the tires move. Most manufacturers
specify optimal tire pressure for cold tires. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![The figure has three parts, each part showing a pair of tires, and each tire connected to a pressure gauge. Each pair of tires represents the before and after images of a single tire, along with a change in pressure in that tire. In part a, the tire pressure is initially zero. After some air is added, represented by an arrow labeled Add air, the pressure rises to slightly above zero. In part b, the tire pressure is initially at the half-way mark. After some air is added, represented by an arrow labeled Add air, the pressure rises to the three-fourths mark. In part c, the tire pressure is initially at the three-fourths mark. After the temperature is raised, represented by an arrow labeled Increase temperature, the pressure rises to nearly the full mark.](../resources/Figure_13_03_03.jpg '(a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion and the pressure increases with more air. (c) Once the tire is inflated, its pressure increases with temperature.')
{: #Figure3}

At room temperatures, collisions between atoms and molecules can be ignored. In
this case, the gas is called an ideal gas, in which case the relationship
between the pressure, volume, and temperature is given by the equation of state
called the ideal gas law.

Ideal Gas Law
</div>
The **ideal gas law** states that

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=Nk_{B}T, $$
</div>
where  $$P $$  is the absolute pressure of a gas,  $$V $$
 is the volume it occupies,  $$N $$
 is the number of atoms and molecules in the gas, and  $$T $$
 is its absolute temperature. The constant  $$k_{B} $$
 is called the **Boltzmann constant** in honor of Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) and has the value

<div class="equation" >
 $$k_{B}= 1.38 \times 10^{-23}  \text{J}/\text{K}. $$
</div>
</div>

The ideal gas law can be derived from basic principles, but was originally
deduced from experimental measurements of Charles’ law (that volume occupied by
a gas is proportional to temperature at a fixed pressure) and from Boyle’s law (
that for a fixed temperature, the product $$PV $$ is a constant). In the ideal
gas model, the volume occupied by its atoms and molecules is a negligible
fraction of $$V $$ . The ideal gas law describes the behavior of real gases
under most conditions. (Note, for example, that $$N $$ is the total number of
atoms and molecules, independent of the type of gas.)

Let us see how the ideal gas law is consistent with the behavior of filling the
tire when it is pumped slowly and the temperature is constant. At first, the
pressure $$P $$ is essentially equal to atmospheric pressure, and the volume $$V
$$ increases in direct proportion to the number of atoms and molecules $$N $$
put into the tire. Once the volume of the tire is constant, the equation
$$PV=Nk\_{B}T $$ predicts that the pressure should increase in proportion to _the
number N of atoms and molecules_.

<div class="title">
Calculating Pressure Changes Due to Temperature Changes: Tire Pressure
</div>
Suppose your bicycle tire is fully inflated, with an absolute pressure of  $$ 7.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
 (a gauge pressure of just under  $$ 90.0 {\text{lb/in}}^{2} $$ ) 
at a temperature of  $$ 18.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 What is the pressure after its temperature has risen to  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$ ?
 Assume that there are no appreciable leaks or changes in volume.

**Strategy**

The pressure in the tire is changing only because of changes in temperature.
First we need to identify what we know and what we want to know, and then
identify an equation to solve for the unknown.

We know the initial pressure $${P}_{0}= 7.00 \times 10^{5} \text{Pa} $$ , the
initial temperature $${T}_{0}= 18.0ºC $$ , and the final temperature $${T}_
{\text{f}}= 35.0ºC $$ . We must find the final pressure $${P}_{\text{f}} $$ .
How can we use the equation $$PV=Nk_{B}T $$ ? At first, it may seem that not
enough information is given, because the volume $$V $$ and number of atoms $$N
$$ are not specified. What we can do is use the equation twice: $${P}_{0}{V}_
{0}=Nk_{B}T_{0} $$ and $${P}_{\text{f}}{V}_{\text{f}}=Nk_{B}T_{\text{f}} $$ . If
we divide $${P}_{\text{f}}{V}_{\text{f}} $$ by $${P}_{0}{V}_{0} $$ we can come
up with an equation that allows us to solve for $${P}_{\text{f}} $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {P}_{\text{f}}{V}_{\text{f}}}{ {P}_{0}{V}_{0}}=\frac{ {N}_{\text{f}}{k_{B}T}_{\text{f}}}{ {N}_{0}{k_{B}T}_{0}} $$
</div>
Since the volume is constant,  $${V}_{\text{f}} $$
 and  $${V}_{0} $$
 are the same and they cancel out. The same is true for  $${N}_{\text{f}} $$
 and  $${N}_{0} $$ ,
 and  $$k $$ ,  which is a constant. Therefore,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {P}_{\text{f}}}{ {P}_{0}}=\frac{ {T}_{\text{f}}}{ {T}_{0}}\text{.} $$
</div>
We can then rearrange this to solve for  $${P}_{\text{f}} $$
\:

<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{f}}={P}_{0}\frac{ {T}_{\text{f}}}{ {T}_{0}}, $$
</div>
where the temperature must be in units of kelvins, because  $${T}_{0} $$
 and  $${T}_{\text{f}} $$
 are absolute temperatures.

**Solution**

1. Convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{}{T}_{0}=\left( 18.0+273\right)\text{K}=291 \text{K}\\ {T}_{\text{f}}=\left( 35.0+273\right)\text{K}=308 \text{K}\end{array} $$
</div>
2. Substitute the known values into the equation.

<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{f}}={P}_{0}\frac{ {T}_{\text{f}}}{ {T}_{0}}= 7.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\left(\frac{308 \text{K}}{291 \text{K}}\right)= 7.41 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The final temperature is about 6% greater than the original temperature, so the
final pressure is about 6% greater as well. Note that **absolute** pressure
and **absolute** temperature must be used in the ideal gas law.

Calculating the Number of Molecules in a Cubic Meter of Gas
</div>
How many molecules are in a typical object, such as gas in a tire or water in a drink? We can use the ideal gas law to give us an idea of how large  $$N $$
 typically is.

Calculate the number of molecules in a cubic meter of gas at standard
temperature and pressure (STP), which is defined to be $$0\text{ºC} $$ and
atmospheric pressure.

**Strategy**

Because pressure, volume, and temperature are all specified, we can use the
ideal gas law $$PV=Nk_{B}T $$ , to find $$N $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}T& =& 0\text{ºC}=273 \text{K}\\ P& =&  1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\\ V& =&  1.00 {\text{m}}^{3}\\ k& =&  1.38 \times 10^{-23}  \text{J/K}\end{array} $$
</div>
2. Identify the unknown: number of molecules,  $$N $$.

3. Rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for $$N $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{}PV=Nk_{B}T\\ N=\frac{PV}{k_{B}T}\end{array} $$
</div>
4. Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for  $$N $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$N=\frac{PV}{k_{B}T}=\frac{\left( 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\right)\left(1.00 {\text{m}}^{3}\right)}{\left( 1.38 \times 10^{-23}  \text{J/K}\right)\left(273 \text{K}\right)}= 2.68 \times 10^{25}  \text{molecules} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This number is undeniably large, considering that a gas is mostly empty space.
$$N $$ is huge, even in small volumes. For example, $$1 {\text{cm}}^{3} $$ of a
gas at STP has $$ 2.68 \times 10^{19} $$ molecules in it. Once again, note that
$$N $$ is the same for all types or mixtures of gases.

### Moles and Avogadro’s Number

It is sometimes convenient to work with a unit other than molecules when
measuring the amount of substance. A **mole** (abbreviated mol) is defined to be
the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as there are
atoms in exactly 12 grams (0.012 kg) of carbon-12. The actual number of atoms or
molecules in one mole is called **Avogadro’s number** $$\left({N}_
{\text{A}}\right) $$ , in recognition of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (
1776–1856). He developed the concept of the mole, based on the hypothesis that
equal volumes of gas, at the same pressure and temperature, contain equal
numbers of molecules. That is, the number is independent of the type of gas.
This hypothesis has been confirmed, and the value of Avogadro’s number is

<div class="equation" >
 $${N}_{\text{A}}= 6.02 \times 10^{23}  {\text{mol}}^{-1}\text{.} $$
</div>

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Avogadro’s Number
</div>
One mole always contains  $$ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  $$
 particles (atoms or molecules), independent of the element or substance. A mole of any substance has a mass in grams equal to its molecular mass, which can be calculated from the atomic masses given in the periodic table of elements.

<div class="equation" >
 $${N}_{\text{A}}= 6.02 \times 10^{23}  {\text{mol}}^{-1} $$

A double-headed vertical arrow stretches between the land and a point in the sky that is well above the peak of the mountain.

Everest.](../resources/Figure_13_03_04.jpg 'How big is a mole? On a macroscopic level, one mole of table tennis balls would cover the Earth to a depth of about 40 km.')

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
We first need to calculate the molar mass (the mass of one mole) of acetaminophen. To do this, we need to multiply the number of atoms of each element by the element’s atomic mass.

Calculating Moles per Cubic Meter and Liters per Mole
</div>
Calculate: (a) the number of moles in  $$ 1.00 {\text{m}}^{3} $$
 of gas at STP, and (b) the number of liters of gas per mole.

**Strategy and Solution**

(a) We are asked to find the number of moles per cubic meter, and we know
from [[Example 2]](#Example2) that the number of molecules per cubic meter at STP
is $$ 2.68 \times 10^{25} $$ . The number of moles can be found by dividing the
number of molecules by Avogadro’s number. We let $$n $$ stand for the number of
moles,

<div class="equation" >
 $$n {\text{mol/m}}^{3}=\frac{N {\text{molecules/m}}^{3}}{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  \text{molecules/mol}}=\frac{ 2.68 \times 10^{25}  {\text{molecules/m}}^{3}}{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  \text{molecules/mol}}= 44.5 {\text{mol/m}}^{3}\text{.} $$
</div>
(b) Using the value obtained for the number of moles in a cubic meter, and converting cubic meters to liters, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{\left(10^{3} {\text{L/m}}^{3}\right)}{ 44.5 {\text{mol/m}}^{3}}= 22.5 \text{L/mol}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This value is very close to the accepted value of 22.4 L/mol. The slight
difference is due to rounding errors caused by using three-digit input. Again
this number is the same for all gases. In other words, it is independent of the
gas.

The (average) molar weight of air is approximately 80% $${\text{N}}_{2} $$ and 20%
$${\text{O}}\_{2} $$ is $$M= 28.8 \text{g}\text{.} $$ Thus the mass of one cubic
meter of air is 1.28 kg. If a living room has dimensions $$5 \text{m}×5
\text{m}×3 \text{m} \text{,} $$ the mass of air inside the room is 96 kg, which
is the typical mass of a human.

The density of air at standard conditions (  $$P=1 \text{atm} $$

 At what pressure is the density  $$0.64 {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
The best way to approach this question is to think about what is happening. If the density drops to half its original value and no molecules are lost, then the volume must double. If we look at the equation  $$PV=Nk_{B}T $$ ,
 we see that when the temperature is constant, the pressure is inversely proportional to volume. Therefore, if the volume doubles, the pressure must drop to half its original value, and  $${P}_{\text{f}}= 0.50 \text{atm}\text{.} $$
</div>

### The Ideal Gas Law Restated Using Moles

A very common expression of the ideal gas law uses the number of moles, $$n $$ ,
rather than the number of atoms and molecules, $$N $$ . We start from the ideal
gas law,

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=\text{Nk_{B}T} \text{,}  $$
</div>

and multiply and divide the equation by Avogadro’s number $${N}_{\text{A}} $$ .
This gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=\frac{N}{ {N}_{\text{A}}}{N}_{\text{A}}k_{B}T\text{.} $$
</div>

Note that $$n=N/{N}_{\text{A}} $$ is the number of moles. We define the
universal gas constant $$R={N}_{\text{A}}k $$ , and obtain the ideal gas law in
terms of moles.

Calculating Number of Moles: Gas in a Bike Tire

How many moles of gas are in a bike tire with a volume of  $$ 2.00 \times 10^{-3} {\text{m}}^{3}\left(2.00 \text{L}\right), $$
 a pressure of  $$ 7.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
 (a gauge pressure of just under  $$ 90.0 {\text{lb/in}}^{2} $$ ), 
and at a temperature of  $$ 18.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy**

Identify the knowns and unknowns, and choose an equation to solve for the
unknown. In this case, we solve the ideal gas law, $$PV=nRT $$ , for the number
of moles $$n $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}P& =&  7.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\\ V& =&  2.00 \times 10^{-3}  {\text{m}}^{3}\\ T& =&  18.0\text{ºC}=291 \text{K}\\ R& =&  8.31 \text{J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\end{array} $$

2. Rearrange the equation to solve for  $$n $$  and substitute known values.

 n & =&  0.579  \text{mol}\end{array} $$

**Discussion**

The most convenient choice for $$R $$ in this case is $$ 8.31 \text{J/mol}\cdot
\text{K} \text{,} $$ because our known quantities are in SI units. The pressure
and temperature are obtained from the initial conditions
in [[Example 1]](#Example1), but we would get the same answer if we used the
final values.

</div>

The ideal gas law can be considered to be another manifestation of the law of
conservation of energy (see [Conservation of Energy](./ch7ConservationOfEnergy)). Work done on a
gas results in an increase in its energy, increasing pressure and/or
temperature, or decreasing volume. This increased energy can also be viewed as
increased internal kinetic energy, given the gas’s atoms and molecules.

### The Ideal Gas Law and Energy

Let us now examine the role of energy in the behavior of gases. When you inflate
a bike tire by hand, you do work by repeatedly exerting a force through a
distance. This energy goes into increasing the pressure of air inside the tire
and increasing the temperature of the pump and the air.

The ideal gas law is closely related to energy: the units on both sides are
joules. The right-hand side of the ideal gas law in $$PV=Nk_{B}T $$ is $$Nk_{B}T
$$ . This term is roughly the amount of translational kinetic energy of $$N $$
atoms or molecules at an absolute temperature $$T $$ , as we shall see formally
in [Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature](./ch13KineticTheory)
. The left-hand side of the ideal gas law is $$PV $$ , which also has the units
of joules. We know from our study of fluids that pressure is one type of
potential energy per unit volume, so pressure multiplied by volume is energy.
The important point is that there is energy in a gas related to both its
pressure and its volume. The energy can be changed when the gas is doing work as
it expands—something we explore
in [Heat and Heat Transfer Methods](../contents/ch14HeatAndHeatTransfers)
—similar to what occurs in gasoline or steam engines and turbines.

Problem-Solving Strategy: The Ideal Gas Law
</div>
**Step 1** Examine the situation to determine that an ideal gas is involved. Most gases are nearly ideal.

**Step 2** Make a list of what quantities are given, or can be inferred from the
problem as stated (identify the known quantities). Convert known values into
proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure, $${\text{m}}^{3} $$ for
volume, molecules for $$N $$ , and moles for $$n $$ ).

**Step 3** Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify
the unknown quantities). A written list is useful.

**Step 4** Determine whether the number of molecules or the number of moles is
known, in order to decide which form of the ideal gas law to use. The first form
is $$PV=Nk_{B}T $$ and involves $$N $$ , the number of atoms or molecules. The
second form is $$PV=nRT $$ and involves $$n $$ , the number of moles.

**Step 5** Solve the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the
unknown quantity). You may need to take a ratio of final states to initial
states to eliminate the unknown quantities that are kept fixed.

**Step 6** Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the
appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. Be
certain to use absolute temperature and absolute pressure.

**Step 7** Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?

Atoms and molecules are close together in solids and liquids. In gases they are separated by empty space. Thus gases have lower densities than liquids and solids. Density is mass per unit volume, and volume is related to the size of a body (such as a sphere) cubed.

Find out the human population of Earth. Is there a mole of people inhabiting Earth? If the average mass of a person is 60 kg, calculate the mass of a mole of people. How does the mass of a mole of people compare with the mass of Earth?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Compare the current human population to Avogadro's number, then calculate the mass of a mole of people and compare to Earth's mass.

**Solution:**
The current human population is approximately 8 billion people = $$ 8 \times 10^{9} $$ people.

Avogadro's number is $$ 6.02 \times 10^{23} $$, so we have:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ 8 \times 10^{9}}{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}}=1.3 \times 10^{-14} \text{ moles of people} $$
</div>

Clearly, we do **not** have a mole of people on Earth—we have only about $$10^{-14}$$ moles of people.

If we had a mole of people ($$6.02 \times 10^{23}$$ people), each with mass 60 kg:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Mass}=\left( 6.02 \times 10^{23} \text{ people}\right)\left(60 \text{ kg/person}\right)= 3.61 \times 10^{25}  \text{kg} $$
</div>

Earth's mass is approximately $$ 5.97 \times 10^{24} $$ kg. The ratio is:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ 3.61 \times 10^{25}  \text{kg}}{ 5.97 \times 10^{24}  \text{kg}}\approx 6.0 $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
A mole of people would have about 6 times the mass of Earth! This illustrates the enormous magnitude of Avogadro's number. The fact that Avogadro's number is so large explains why macroscopic amounts of substances contain such huge numbers of atoms and molecules, and why we can observe statistical properties like temperature and pressure despite the random motion of individual particles.

Under what circumstances would you expect a gas to behave significantly differently than predicted by the ideal gas law?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the assumptions of the ideal gas law and when they break down.

**Solution:**
The ideal gas law assumes that:
1. Gas molecules have negligible volume compared to the container volume
2. There are no intermolecular forces (except during collisions)
3. Collisions are perfectly elastic

A gas behaves significantly differently from ideal when:

1. **High pressures**: At high pressure, molecules are forced close together, and their finite volume becomes significant compared to the available space. The actual volume available for molecular motion is less than the container volume.

2. **Low temperatures**: At low temperatures (near the boiling point), intermolecular attractive forces become significant. Molecules spend more time near each other, and these attractive forces affect pressure and can lead to condensation.

3. **Near phase transitions**: When a gas is close to liquefying or solidifying, intermolecular forces dominate and the ideal gas law fails.

4. **Large, complex molecules**: Larger molecules have greater intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) and occupy more volume, causing deviations from ideal behavior.

**Discussion:**
Real gases are described more accurately by the van der Waals equation, which includes correction terms for molecular volume and intermolecular forces. However, under normal conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), most gases behave nearly ideally because molecules are far apart and moving fast. The ideal gas law is an excellent approximation for gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and helium under typical conditions.

A constant-volume gas thermometer contains a fixed amount of gas. What property of the gas is measured to indicate its temperature?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the ideal gas law with constant volume and constant amount of gas.

**Solution:**
In a constant-volume gas thermometer, the **pressure** of the gas is measured to indicate temperature.

From the ideal gas law: $$PV=nRT$$

When volume ($$V$$) and amount of gas ($$n$$) are held constant:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{nR}{V}T=\text{constant} \times T $$
</div>

This shows that pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature when volume and amount of gas are fixed. Therefore, by measuring the pressure of the gas, we can determine its temperature.

**Discussion:**
Constant-volume gas thermometers are among the most accurate thermometers available and are used to calibrate other thermometers. They work over a wide temperature range and can measure temperatures from near absolute zero to very high temperatures. The gas used (often helium or hydrogen) must behave ideally over the measurement range. The direct proportionality between pressure and temperature makes these thermometers particularly useful for defining the Kelvin temperature scale, as they can extrapolate to find absolute zero (the temperature at which an ideal gas would have zero pressure).

Convert an absolute pressure of  $$ 7.00 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$

 (This value was stated to be just less than  $$90.0 {\text{lb/in}}^{2} $$
 in [[Example 4]](#Example4). Is it?)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Gauge pressure is absolute pressure minus atmospheric pressure. Convert to psi using the conversion 1 atm = 14.7 psi = $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa.

**Solution:**
First find gauge pressure in Pa:
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}={P}_{\text{abs}}-{P}_{\text{atm}}= 7.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 5.99 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

Convert to psi (pounds per square inch):
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}= 5.99 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} \times \frac{14.7 \text{ psi}}{ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}}= 87.1 \text{ psi} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
Yes, this confirms the statement—87.1 psi is indeed just less than 90.0 psi. Gauge pressure is what's typically displayed on tire pressure gauges because it represents the excess pressure above atmospheric pressure. The absolute pressure of $$ 7.00 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa corresponds to about 6.93 atm, meaning the tire pressure is about 5.93 atm above atmospheric pressure.

To test a balloon, it is placed in a lab and filled with helium. The temperature of the helium is  $$ 10.0\text{ºC} $$  and the pressure is 1.00 atmosphere. The pressure in the lab is maintained.

 (b) What is the gauge pressure? (Assume the pressure in the lab remains at 1.00 atmosphere during the experiment.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
This is a multi-step problem. First find the amount of helium (moles) in the initial state. Then use this with the new conditions to find the new pressure.

**Solution:**
(a) Initial conditions: $$T_0 = 10.0ºC = 283 K$$, $$P_0 = 1.00 atm$$, $$V_0$$

Final conditions: $$T_f = -50.0ºC = 223 K$$, $$V_f = 20V_0$$, $$P_f = ?$$

Using ideal gas law for both states:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{P_0V_0}{T_0}=\frac{P_fV_f}{T_f} $$
</div>

Solving for $$P_f$$:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P_f=P_0\frac{V_0}{V_f}\frac{T_f}{T_0}=(1.00 \text{ atm})\frac{V_0}{20V_0}\frac{223 \text{ K}}{283 \text{ K}}= 0.0394 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

Converting to Pa:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P_f= 0.0394 \text{ atm} \times 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa/atm}= 3.98 \times 10^{3}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

(b) Gauge pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}=P_f-{P}_{\text{atm}}= 0.0394 \text{ atm}- 1.00 \text{ atm}=-0.96 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The negative gauge pressure indicates that the pressure inside the balloon is less than atmospheric pressure—the balloon would be partially deflated or collapsed. This makes sense: the temperature decreased (reducing pressure), and the volume increased dramatically (also reducing pressure). The combined effect overwhelms the initial pressure, resulting in a final pressure well below atmospheric.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Convert from m⁻³ to cm⁻³ using the fact that 1 m = 100 cm. (b) Calculate the number in one μm³. (c) Consider what this means for molecular spacing.

**Solution:**
(a) Convert from m⁻³ to cm⁻³:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{N}{V}= 2.68 \times 10^{25}  {\text{m}}^{-3} \times {\left(\frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}}\right)}^{3}= 2.68 \times 10^{25}  {\text{m}}^{-3} \times \frac{1}{ 10^{6}  {\text{cm}}^{3}/{\text{m}}^{3}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{N}{V}= 2.68 \times 10^{19}  {\text{cm}}^{-3} $$
</div>

This confirms the stated value.

(b) For one cubic micrometer ($${\text{μm}}^{3}$$):

First convert: $$1 \text{ μm}= 10^{-6} \text{ m}= 10^{-4} \text{ cm}$$

<div class="equation" >
 $$N=\left( 2.68 \times 10^{19}  {\text{cm}}^{-3}\right) \times {\left( 10^{-4} \text{ cm}\right)}^{3}=\left( 2.68 \times 10^{19}\right) \times \left( 10^{-12}\right)= 2.68 \times 10^{7}  \text{ molecules} $$
</div>

About **27 million molecules** in one cubic micrometer.

(c) This implies that even in a very small volume (1 μm)³, there are still millions of molecules. Since molecules are separated by relatively large distances in a gas, we can estimate the average separation. If we have $$2.68 \times 10^{7}$$ molecules in a cube of side 1 μm, then each molecule occupies on average:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Volume per molecule}=\frac{1 {\text{μm}}^{3}}{ 2.68 \times 10^{7}}= 3.7 \times 10^{-8}  {\text{μm}}^{3} $$
</div>

Taking the cube root to find typical spacing:
<div class="equation" >
 $$d=\sqrt[3]{ 3.7 \times 10^{-8}  {\text{μm}}^{3}}= 3.3 \times 10^{-3}  \text{ μm}= 3.3 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
Molecules at STP are separated by about 3.3 nanometers on average, which is about 10 times the diameter of a typical molecule (around 0.3 nm). This explains why gases are compressible—there's lots of empty space between molecules. It also explains why gases have much lower densities than liquids or solids, where molecules are essentially touching. This large separation is why intermolecular forces are negligible in ideal gases.

**Strategy:**
Assume temperature and amount of gas remain constant. Use $$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$ (Boyle's law).

Final conditions: $$P_2 = 7.50 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa, $$V_2 = ?$$

**Discussion:**
The air expands by 35% as cabin pressure decreases, which can cause discomfort. This is why passengers sometimes experience bloating or digestive discomfort during flights. The expansion occurs because the external pressure decreases while the gas inside maintains its tendency to expand.

Even in an "excellent" vacuum of $$10^{-7}$$ Pa (about $$10^{-12}$$ atmospheres), there are still about 25 million atoms per cubic centimeter!

- $$V_{\text{tire}}= 2.00 \text{ L}= 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^{3}$$

</div>

**Discussion:**
The pressure drops from $$ 7.00 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa to $$ 6.95 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa, a decrease of about $$ 5.0 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa (or about 0.05 atm). This small change makes sense because we only removed about 0.7% of the gas ($$4.18 \times 10^{-3}$$ mol out of 0.579 mol). This illustrates why bike tires don't lose much pressure from small leaks, but also why it's important to check tire pressure regularly—small amounts of gas loss can accumulate over time. The key insight is that 100 cm³ at atmospheric pressure contains much less gas than 100 cm³ at tire pressure, so removing it has a relatively small effect.

**Discussion:**
This is a very large number of moles for such a small volume (2.00 L). At this extremely high pressure (about 730 atmospheres), the gas is compressed to about 730 times the density it would have at atmospheric pressure. This is why high-pressure gas cylinders must be extremely strong and carefully designed. At such high pressures, real gases start to deviate from ideal gas behavior because the molecules are forced close together and intermolecular forces become significant. However, the ideal gas law still provides a reasonable approximation for many practical purposes. This amount of gas (58 moles) would occupy about 1400 L at standard temperature and pressure!

(a) What is the gauge pressure in a  $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$
 car tire containing 3.60 mol of gas in a 30.0 L volume? (b) What will its gauge pressure be if you add 1.00 L of gas originally at atmospheric pressure and  $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$ ?
 Assume the temperature returns to  $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$
 and the volume remains constant.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use $$PV=nRT$$ to find absolute pressure, then subtract atmospheric pressure to get gauge pressure. (b) Find how many moles are added, calculate new absolute pressure, then find new gauge pressure.

**Solution:**
(a) Initial conditions:
- $$n= 3.60 \text{ mol}$$
- $$V= 30.0 \text{ L}= 3.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^{3}$$
- $$T= 25.0\text{ºC}= 298 \text{ K}$$
- $$R= 8.31 \text{ J/mol}\cdot \text{K}$$

Absolute pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{nRT}{V}=\frac{\left( 3.60 \text{ mol}\right)\left( 8.31 \text{ J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\right)\left(298 \text{ K}\right)}{ 3.00 \times 10^{-2}  \text{m}^{3}}= 2.97 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

Gauge pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}=P-{P}_{\text{atm}}= 2.97 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 1.96 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 1.94 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

(b) Moles of gas added (1.00 L at atmospheric pressure and 25.0ºC):
<div class="equation" >
 $$n_{\text{added}}=\frac{P_{\text{atm}}V_{\text{added}}}{RT}=\frac{\left( 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\right)\left( 1.00 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}^{3}\right)}{\left( 8.31 \text{ J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\right)\left(298 \text{ K}\right)}= 0.0408 \text{ mol} $$
</div>

Total moles:
<div class="equation" >
 $$n_{\text{total}}= 3.60+ 0.0408= 3.64 \text{ mol} $$
</div>

New absolute pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P_{\text{new}}=\frac{n_{\text{total}}RT}{V}=\frac{\left( 3.64 \text{ mol}\right)\left( 8.31 \text{ J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\right)\left(298 \text{ K}\right)}{ 3.00 \times 10^{-2}  \text{m}^{3}}= 3.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

New gauge pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge,new}}= 3.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 1.99 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 1.97 \text{ atm} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
Adding 1.00 L of gas at atmospheric pressure adds only 0.0408 moles, which is a small fraction (about 1.1%) of the original 3.60 moles. Consequently, the gauge pressure increases only slightly from 1.94 atm to 1.97 atm. This illustrates an important point: when adding gas to a tire, the volume of gas measured at atmospheric pressure is much less significant than the same volume measured at tire pressure. To significantly increase tire pressure, you need to add many liters of atmospheric-pressure gas, which is why it takes time to pump up a tire with a hand pump.
