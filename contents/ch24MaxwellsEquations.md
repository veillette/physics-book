* Restate Maxwell’s equations.

The Scotsman James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) is regarded as the greatest
theoretical physicist of the 19th century. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)
Although he died young, Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic
theory, represented by **Maxwell’s equations**, he also developed the kinetic
theory of gases and made significant contributions to the understanding of color
vision and the nature of Saturn’s rings.

Maxwell brought together all the work that had been done by brilliant physicists
such as Oersted, Coulomb, Gauss, and Faraday, and added his own insights to
develop the overarching theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell’s equations are
paraphrased here in words because their mathematical statement is beyond the
level of this text. However, the equations illustrate how apparently simple
mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of
concepts—why mathematics is the language of science.

Maxwell’s Equations
</div>
1.   **Electric field lines** originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge, and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant
     $${\epsilon }_{0} $$ ,   also known as the permittivity of free space. From Maxwell’s first equation we obtain a special form of Coulomb’s law known as Gauss’s law for electricity.
2.   **Magnetic field lines** are continuous, having no beginning or end. No magnetic monopoles are known to exist. The strength of the magnetic force is related to the magnetic constant
     $${\mu }_{0} $$ ,   also known as the permeability of free space. This second of Maxwell’s equations is known as Gauss’s law for magnetism.
3.   A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) and, hence, an electric field. The direction of the emf opposes the change. This third of Maxwell’s equations is Faraday’s law of induction, and includes Lenz’s law.
4.   Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields. This fourth of Maxwell’s equations encompasses Ampere’s law and adds another source of magnetism—changing electric fields.

</div>

Maxwell’s equations encompass the major laws of electricity and magnetism. What
is not so apparent is the symmetry that Maxwell introduced in his mathematical
framework. Especially important is his addition of the hypothesis that changing
electric fields create magnetic fields. This is exactly analogous (and
symmetric) to Faraday’s law of induction and had been suspected for some time,
but fits beautifully into Maxwell’s equations.

Symmetry is apparent in nature in a wide range of situations. In contemporary
research, symmetry plays a major part in the search for sub-atomic particles
using massive multinational particle accelerators such as the new Large Hadron
Collider at CERN.

<div class="title">
Making Connections: Unification of Forces
</div>
Maxwell’s complete and symmetric theory showed that electric and magnetic forces are not separate, but different manifestations of the same thing—the electromagnetic force. This classical unification of forces is one motivation for current attempts to unify the four basic forces in nature—the gravitational, electrical, strong, and weak nuclear forces.

</div>

Since changing electric fields create relatively weak magnetic fields, they
could not be easily detected at the time of Maxwell’s hypothesis. Maxwell
realized, however, that oscillating charges, like those in AC circuits, produce
changing electric fields. He predicted that these changing fields would
propagate from the source like waves generated on a lake by a jumping fish.

The waves predicted by Maxwell would consist of oscillating electric and
magnetic fields—defined to be an electromagnetic wave (EM wave). Electromagnetic
waves would be capable of exerting forces on charges great distances from their
source, and they might thus be detectable. Maxwell calculated that
electromagnetic waves would propagate at a speed given by the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}. $$
</div>

When the values for $${\mu }_{0} $$ and $${\epsilon }_{0} $$ are entered into
the equation for $$c $$ , we find that

<div class="equation" >
 $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left( 8.85 \times 10^{-12}  \frac{ {\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}\right)\left(4\pi  \times 10^{-7}  \frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}\right)}}=3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}, $$
</div>

which is the speed of light. In fact, Maxwell concluded that light is an
electromagnetic wave having such wavelengths that it can be detected by the eye.

Other wavelengths should exist—it remained to be seen if they did. If so,
Maxwell’s theory and remarkable predictions would be verified, the greatest
triumph of physics since Newton. Experimental verification came within a few
years, but not before Maxwell’s death.

### Hertz’s Observations

The German physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) was the first to generate and
detect certain types of electromagnetic waves in the laboratory. Starting in
1887, he performed a series of experiments that not only confirmed the existence
of electromagnetic waves, but also verified that they travel at the speed of
light.

Hertz used an AC $$\text{RLC} $$
(resistor-inductor-capacitor) circuit that resonates at a known frequency $${f}_ {0}=\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{\text{LC}}} $$ and connected it to a loop of wire as
shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). High voltages induced across the gap in the
loop produced sparks that were visible evidence of the current in the circuit
and that helped generate electromagnetic waves.

Across the laboratory, Hertz had another loop attached to another $$\text{RLC} $$

circuit, which could be tuned (as the dial on a radio) to the same resonant
frequency as the first and could, thus, be made to receive electromagnetic
waves. This loop also had a gap across which sparks were generated, giving solid
evidence that electromagnetic waves had been received.

![The circuit diagram shows a simple circuit containing an alternating voltage source, a resistor R, capacitor C and a transformer, which provides the impedance. The transformer is shown to consist of two coils separated by a core. In parallel with the transformer is connected a wire loop labeled as Loop one Transmitter with a small gap that creates sparks across the gap. The sparks create electromagnetic waves, which are transmitted through the air to a similar loop next to it labeled as Loop two Receiver. These waves induce sparks in Loop two, and are detected by the tuner shown as a rectangular box connected to it.](../resources/Figure_24_01_02.jpg "The apparatus used by Hertz in 1887 to generate and detect electromagnetic waves. An \( RLC \) circuit connected to the first loop caused sparks across a gap in the wire loop and generated electromagnetic waves. Sparks across a gap in the second loop located across the laboratory gave evidence that the waves had been received. ")

Hertz also studied the reflection, refraction, and interference patterns of the
electromagnetic waves he generated, verifying their wave character. He was able
to determine wavelength from the interference patterns, and knowing their
frequency, he could calculate the propagation speed using the equation
$$\upsilon =f\lambda $$
(velocity—or speed—equals frequency times wavelength). Hertz was thus able to
prove that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. The SI unit for
frequency, the hertz ( $$1 Hz=1 \text{cycle/sec} $$ ), is named in his honor.

### Section Summary

* Electromagnetic waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields and
  propagate at the speed of light $$c $$ . They were predicted by Maxwell, who
  also showed that

  <div class="equation" >
   $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}, $$
  </div>

where $${\mu }_{0} $$ is the permeability of free space and $${\epsilon }_{0} $$
is the permittivity of free space.

* Maxwell’s prediction of electromagnetic waves resulted from his formulation of
  a complete and symmetric theory of electricity and magnetism, known as
  Maxwell’s equations.
* These four equations are paraphrased in this text, rather than presented
  numerically, and encompass the major laws of electricity and magnetism. First
  is Gauss’s law for electricity, second is Gauss’s law for magnetism, third is
  Faraday’s law of induction, including Lenz’s law, and fourth is Ampere’s law
  in a symmetric formulation that adds another source of magnetism—changing
  electric fields.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Verify that the correct value for the speed of light  $$c $$
 is obtained when numerical values for the permeability and permittivity of free space ( $${\mu }_{0} $$
 and  $${\epsilon }_{0} $$ )
are entered into the equation  $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Strategy
</div>
To verify that Maxwell's equation correctly predicts the speed of light, we need to substitute the known values of the permeability of free space $${\mu }_{0}$$ and the permittivity of free space $${\epsilon }_{0}$$ into the equation $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}$$ and confirm that the result equals the experimentally measured speed of light, $$3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
The permeability of free space is:

<div class="equation">
 $${\mu }_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ }\frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}$$
</div>

The permittivity of free space is:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${\epsilon }_{0}=8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ }\frac{{\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

First, let's calculate the product $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}$$:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}=\left(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ }\frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}\right)\left(8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ }\frac{{\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}\right)$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}=\left(4\pi \times 8.85\right) \times 10^{-19} \text{ }\frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}\cdot \frac{{\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0} \approx 1.112 \times 10^{-17} \text{ }\frac{{\text{s}}^{2}}{{\text{m}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

Now we can calculate the speed of light:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1.112 \times 10^{-17} \text{ }\frac{{\text{s}}^{2}}{{\text{m}}^{2}}}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$c=\frac{1}{3.336 \times 10^{-9} \text{ }\frac{\text{s}}{\text{m}}}=3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
This calculation demonstrates one of the most profound insights in physics: Maxwell's equations, which were formulated to describe electromagnetic phenomena, predict that electromagnetic waves travel at exactly the speed of light. This was not a coincidence—it led Maxwell to the revolutionary conclusion that light itself is an electromagnetic wave. The fact that fundamental constants from electricity ($${\epsilon }_{0}$$) and magnetism ($${\mu }_{0}$$) combine to give the speed of light reveals the deep connection between these seemingly separate phenomena. This verification was a triumph of theoretical physics, as Maxwell's prediction was later confirmed experimentally by Heinrich Hertz.

<div class="title">
Final Answer
</div>
When the numerical values $${\mu }_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot \text{m/A}$$ and $${\epsilon }_{0}=8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C}^{2}/(\text{N}\cdot \text{m}^{2})$$ are substituted into Maxwell's equation $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}$$, we obtain $$c=3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}$$, which is indeed the correct experimentally measured value for the speed of light.

Show that, when SI units for  $${\mu }_{0} $$
 and  $${\epsilon }_{0} $$
 are entered, the units given by the right-hand side of the equation in the problem above are m/s.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Strategy
</div>
To verify that the equation $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}$$ gives units of velocity (m/s), we need to substitute the SI units for $${\mu }_{0}$$ and $${\epsilon }_{0}$$ into the equation and perform unit analysis to show that all units cancel properly to yield m/s. We'll use the fact that SI units can be expressed in terms of fundamental units (meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, etc.) and that the tesla and newton can be broken down into these base units.

<div class="title">
Solution
</div>
The SI unit for the permeability of free space $${\mu }_{0}$$ is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}$$
</div>

The SI unit for the permittivity of free space $${\epsilon }_{0}$$ is:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$\frac{{\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

We need to express these in terms of fundamental SI units. First, recall that:
- Tesla: $$\text{T}=\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{A}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}$$
- Newton: {% raw %}$$\text{N}=\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}$${% endraw %}
- Coulomb: $$\text{C}=\text{A}\cdot \text{s}$$

Substituting for the tesla in $${\mu }_{0}$$:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$\frac{\text{T}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{A}}=\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{A}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}\cdot \frac{\text{m}}{\text{A}}=\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}}{{\text{A}}^{2}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

Substituting for the newton and coulomb in $${\epsilon }_{0}$$:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$\frac{{\text{C}}^{2}}{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}=\frac{{(\text{A}\cdot \text{s})}^{2}}{\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}=\frac{{\text{A}}^{2}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}{\text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{3}}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}=\frac{{\text{A}}^{2}\cdot {\text{s}}^{4}}{\text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{3}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

Now we can find the units of $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}$$:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $${\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}=\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}}{{\text{A}}^{2}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}\cdot \frac{{\text{A}}^{2}\cdot {\text{s}}^{4}}{\text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{3}}=\frac{{\text{s}}^{2}}{{\text{m}}^{2}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

Finally, we can find the units of $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}$$:

<div class="equation">
{% raw %} $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{{\text{s}}^{2}}{{\text{m}}^{2}}}}=\frac{1}{\frac{\text{s}}{\text{m}}}=\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$$ {% endraw %}
</div>

<div class="title">
Discussion
</div>
This dimensional analysis confirms that Maxwell's equation for the speed of electromagnetic waves is dimensionally consistent. The fact that the units work out to m/s (velocity) is not merely a mathematical convenience—it reflects the physical reality that $$c$$ represents the propagation speed of electromagnetic waves through space. The cancellation of units also reveals how electromagnetic and mechanical quantities are interconnected. The ampere (A) cancels because it appears in both electrical and magnetic quantities, the kilogram (kg) cancels because it appears in both the definition of force (newton) and magnetic field (tesla), and what remains is purely the ratio of distance to time, which is velocity. This elegant dimensional consistency was part of what gave Maxwell confidence in his theoretical prediction.

<div class="title">
Final Answer
</div>
When SI units for $${\mu }_{0}$$ and $${\epsilon }_{0}$$ are substituted into the equation $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {\mu }_{0}{\epsilon }_{0}}}$$, the units reduce to $$\text{m/s}$$, confirming that the equation correctly predicts a velocity.
