**Newton’s second law of motion** is closely related to Newton’s first law of
motion. It mathematically states the cause and effect relationship between force
and changes in motion. Newton’s second law of motion is more quantitative and is
used extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force.
Before we can write down Newton’s second law as a simple equation giving the
exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to sharpen some
ideas that have already been mentioned.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in
motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by
definition, that there is an
**acceleration**. Newton’s first law says that a net external force causes a
change in motion; thus, we see that a _net external force causes acceleration_.

Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external force? An
intuitive notion of external is correct—an **external force** acts from outside
the **system** of interest. For example, in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(a) the system of
interest is the wagon plus the child in it. The two forces exerted by the other
children are external forces. An internal force acts between elements of the
system. Again looking at [Figure 1](#Figure1)(a), the force the child in the wagon
exerts to hang onto the wagon is an internal force between elements of the
system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system,
according to Newton’s first law. (The internal forces actually cancel, as we
shall see in the next section.) _You must define the boundaries of the system
before you can determine which forces are external_. Sometimes the system is
obvious, whereas other times identifying the boundaries of a system is more
subtle. The concept of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is
the correct application of Newton’s laws. This concept will be revisited many
times on our journey through physics.

![(a) A boy in a wagon is pushed by two girls toward the right. The force on the boy is represented by vector F one toward the right, and the force on the wagon is represented by vector F two in the same direction. Acceleration a is shown by a vector a toward the right and a friction force f is acting in the opposite direction, represented by a vector pointing toward the left. The weight W of the wagon is shown by a vector acting downward, and the normal force acting upward on the wagon is represented by a vector N. A free-body diagram is also shown, with F one and F two represented by arrows in the same direction toward the right and f represented by an arrow toward the left, so the resultant force F net is represented by an arrow toward the right. W is represented by an arrow downward and N is represented by an arrow upward; both the arrows have same length.(b) A boy in a wagon is pushed by a woman with a force F adult, represented by an arrow pointing toward the right. A vector a-prime, represented by an arrow, depicts acceleration toward the right. Friction force, represented by a vector f, acts toward the left. The weight of the wagon W is shown by a vector pointing downward, and the Normal force, represented by a vector N having same length as W, acts upward. A free-body diagram for this situation shows force F represented by an arrow pointing to the right having a large length; a friction force vector represented by an arrow f pointing left has a small length. The weight W is represented by an arrow pointing downward, and the normal force N, is represented by an arrow pointing upward, having the same length as W.](../resources/Figure_04_03_01.jpg "Different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. (a) Two children push a wagon with a child in it. Arrows representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is the wagon and its rider. The weight ( \\vb{w} ) of the system and the support of the ground ( \\vb{N} ) are also shown for completeness and are assumed to cancel. The vector ( \\vb{f} ) represents the friction acting on the wagon, and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the wagon.
(b) All of the external forces acting on the system add together to produce a net force, ( \\vb{F}_\\text{net} ) . The free-body diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The dot represents the center of mass of the system. Each force vector extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right, we draw the vectors collinearly.
(c) A larger net external force produces a larger acceleration ( a'>a ) when an adult pushes the child.")
{: #Figure1 height="350"}

Now, it seems reasonable that acceleration should be directly proportional to
and in the same direction as the net (
total) external force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified
experimentally and is illustrated in [Figure 1](#Figure1). In part (a), a smaller
force causes a smaller acceleration than the larger force illustrated in part (
c). For completeness, the vertical forces are also shown; they are assumed to
cancel since there is no acceleration in the vertical direction. The vertical
forces are the weight $$ \vb{w} $$ and the support of the ground $$ \vb{N} $$,
and the horizontal force $$ \vb{f} $$ represents the force of friction. These
will be discussed in more detail in later sections. For now, we will define
**friction** as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are
touching. [Figure 1](#Figure1)(b)
shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net
force, $$ \vb{F}\_{\text{net}} $$.

To obtain an equation for Newton’s second law, we first write the relationship
of acceleration and net external force as the proportionality.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{a} \propto \vb{F}_{\text{net}}, $$
</div>

where the symbol $$ \propto $$ means “proportional to,” and $$ \vb{F}\_ {\text{net}} $$ is the **net external force**. (The net external force is the
vector sum of all external forces and can be determined graphically, using the
head-to-tail method, or analytically, using components. The techniques are the
same as for the addition of other vectors, and are covered
in [Two-Dimensional Kinematics](./ch3TwoDimensionalKinematics).)
This proportionality states what we have said in words—_acceleration is directly
proportional to the net external force_. Once the system of interest is chosen,
it is important to identify the external forces and ignore the internal ones. It
is a tremendous simplification not to have to consider the numerous internal
forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within
the child’s body, let alone the myriad of forces between atoms in the objects,
but by doing so, we can easily solve some very complex problems with only
minimal error due to our simplification.

Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional
to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia),
the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. And indeed, as
illustrated in [Figure 2](#Figure2), the same net external force applied to a car
produces a much smaller acceleration than when applied to a basketball. The
proportionality is written as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \mag{a}\propto \frac{1}{m} $$
</div>

where $$ m $$ is the mass of the system. Experiments have shown that
acceleration is exactly inversely proportional to mass, just as it is exactly
linearly proportional to the net external force.

![(a) A basketball player pushes the ball with the force shown by a vector F toward the right and an acceleration a-one represented by an arrow toward the right. M sub one is the mass of the ball. (b) The same basketball player is pushing a car with the same force, represented by the vector F towards the right, resulting in an acceleration shown by a vector a toward the right. The mass of the car is m sub two. The acceleration in the second case, a sub two, is represented by a shorter arrow than in the first case, a sub one.](../resources/Figure_04_03_02.jpg 'The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations.

(b) The same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and produces a far smaller acceleration (even if friction is negligible).
(c) The free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of the two situations. A series of patterns for the free-body diagram will emerge as you do more problems.')
{: #Figure2}

It has been found that the acceleration of an object depends _only_ on the net
external force and the mass of the object. Combining the two proportionalities
just given yields Newton\'s second law of motion.

<div class="title">
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
</div>
The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external 
force acting on the system, and inversely proportional to its mass.

In equation form, Newton’s second law of motion is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{a}=\frac{ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}}{m} . $$
</div>
This is often written in the more familiar form

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m \vb{a} . $$
</div>
When only the magnitude of force and acceleration are considered, this equation is simply

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=ma . $$
</div>
</div>

Although these last two equations are really the same, the first gives more
insight into what Newton’s second law means. The law is a _cause and effect
relationship_ among three quantities that is not simply based on their
definitions. The validity of the second law is completely based on experimental
verification.

### Units of Force

$$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$ is used to define the units of force in terms
of the three basic units for mass, length, and time. The SI unit of force is
called the **newton** (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a
1-kg system at the rate of $$ 1\mss $$. That is, since $$ \vb{F}_ {\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$,

<div class="equation">
 $$ 1 \N =1 \kg \cdot \mss . $$
</div>

While almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in the
United States the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N =
0.225 lb.

### Weight and the Gravitational Force

When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s
second law states that a net force on an object is responsible for its
acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object
is the gravitational force, commonly called its **weight**, $$ \vb{w} $$. Weight
can be denoted as a vector $$ \vb{w} $$ because it has a direction; _down_ is,
by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence weight is a downward force.
The magnitude of weight is denoted as $$ w $$. Galileo was instrumental in
showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same
acceleration $$ g $$. Using Galileo’s result and Newton’s second law, we can
derive an equation for weight.

Consider an object with mass $$ m $$ falling downward toward Earth. It
experiences only the downward force of gravity, which has magnitude $$ w $$.
Newton’s second law states that the magnitude of the net external force on an
object is $$ \mag{F}\_{\text{net}}=m \mag{a} $$.

Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity,$$ F\_ {\text{net}}=w $$. We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is
$$ g $$, or $$ a=g $$. Substituting these into Newton’s second law gives

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Weight
</div>
This is the equation for *weight*—the gravitational force on a mass $$ m $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ w=mg . $$
</div>
Since $$ g=9.80\mss $$ on Earth, the weight of a 1.0 kg object on Earth
is 9.8 N, as we see:

<div class="equation">
 $$ w=mg =\left(1.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)=9.8\N . $$
</div>
Recall that $$ g $$ can take a positive or negative value, depending on the positive direction in
the coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving
problems with weight.

</div>

When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in
**free-fall**. That is, the only force acting on the object is the force of
gravity. In the real world, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are
never truly in free-fall because there is always some upward force from the air
acting on the object.

The acceleration due to gravity $$ g $$ varies slightly over the surface of
Earth, so that the weight of an object depends on location and is not an
intrinsic property of the object. Weight varies dramatically if one leaves
Earth’s surface. On the Moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is
only $$ 1.67\mss $$. A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on Earth and only
about 1.7 N on the Moon.

The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that _the weight of an object
is the gravitational force on it from the nearest large body_, such as Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and so on. This is the most common and useful definition of
weight in physics. It differs dramatically, however, from the definition of
weight used by NASA and the popular media in relation to space travel and
exploration. When they speak of “weightlessness” and “microgravity,” they are
really referring to the phenomenon we call “free-fall” in physics. We shall use
the above definition of weight, and we will make careful distinctions between
free-fall and actual weightlessness.

It is important to be aware that weight and mass are very different physical
quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of matter (
how much “stuff”) and does not vary in classical physics, whereas weight is the
gravitational force and does vary depending on gravity. It is tempting to equate
the two, since most of our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an
object only varies a little with the location of the object. Furthermore, the
terms _mass_ and _weight_ are used interchangeably in everyday language; for
example, our medical records often show our “weight” in kilograms, but never in
the correct units of newtons.

<div class="title">
Common Misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight
</div>
Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language.
However, in science, these terms are distinctly different from one another.
Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. The typical measure of mass
is the kilogram (or the “slug” in English units). Weight, on the other hand,
is a measure of the force of gravity acting on an object. Weight is equal to the
mass of an object ( $$ m $$ ) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity ( $$ g $$).
Like any other force, weight is measured in terms of newtons (or pounds in
English units).

Assuming the mass of an object is kept intact, it will remain the same,
regardless of its location. However, because weight depends on the acceleration
due to gravity, the weight of an object _can change_ when the object enters into
a region with stronger or weaker gravity. For example, the acceleration due to
gravity on the Moon is $$ 1.67\mss $$
(which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, $$ 9.80\mss $$

). If you measured your weight on Earth and then measured your weight on the
Moon, you would find that you “weigh” much less, even though you do not look any
skinnier. This is because the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon. In fact,
when people say that they are “losing weight,” they really mean that they are
losing “mass” (which in turn causes them to weigh less).

Take-Home Experiment: Mass and Weight
</div>
What do bathroom scales measure? When you stand on a bathroom scale, what happens to the scale? It depresses slightly.
The scale contains springs that compress in proportion to your weight—similar to rubber bands expanding when pulled.
The springs provide a measure of your weight (for an object which is not accelerating). This is a force in newtons
(or pounds). In most countries, the measurement is divided by 9.80 to give a reading in mass units of kilograms.
The scale measures weight but is calibrated to provide information about mass. While standing on a bathroom scale,
push down on a table next to you. What happens to the reading? Why? Would your scale measure the same “mass” on
Earth as on the Moon?

What Acceleration Can a Person Produce when Pushing a Lawn Mower?
</div>
Suppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N (about 11 lb) parallel to
the ground. The mass of the mower is 24 kg. What is its acceleration?

![A man pushing a lawnmower to the right. A red vector above the lawnmower is pointing to the right and labeled F sub net.](../resources/Figure_04_03_03.jpg "The net force on a lawn mower is 51 N to the right. At what rate does the lawn mower accelerate to the right?")
{: #Figure3}

**Strategy**

Since $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}} $$ and $$ m $$ are given, the acceleration can be
calculated directly from Newton’s second law as stated in $$ \vb{F}_ {\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$.

**Solution**

The magnitude of the acceleration $$ a $$ is $$ a=\frac{ F_{\text{net}}}{m} $$.
Entering known values gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{51 \N }{24 \kg } $$
</div>
Substituting the units $$ \kg \cdot \mss $$ for N yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{51 \kg \cdot \mss }{24 \kg }=2.13 \mss . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net
force, which is parallel to the ground. There is no information given in this
example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can
say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by
the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the
motion (since we know the mower moves forward), and the vertical forces must
cancel if there is to be no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is
moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be
reasonable for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long
because the person’s top speed would soon be reached.

What Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled?
</div>
Prior to manned space flights, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft, missile equipment, and physiological effects on
human subjects at high speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or two rails and propelled by
several rockets. Calculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust $$ \vb{T} $$, for the
four-rocket propulsion system shown in [Figure 4](#Figure4). The
sled’s initial acceleration is $$ 49\mss $$,
the mass of the system is 2100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion
is known to be 650 N.

![A sled is shown with four rockets, each producing the same thrust, represented by equal length arrows labeled as vector T pushing the sled toward the right. Friction force is represented by an arrow labeled as vector f pointing toward the left on the sled. The weight of the sled is represented by an arrow labeled as vector W, shown pointing downward, and the normal force is represented by an arrow labeled as vector N having the same length as W acting upward on the sled. A free-body diagram is also shown for the situation. Four arrows of equal length representing vector T point toward the right, a vector f represented by a smaller arrow points left, vector N is an arrow pointing upward, and the weight W is an arrow of equal length pointing downward.](../resources/Figure_04_03_04.jpg "A sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right. Each rocket creates an identical thrust \( \vb{T} \) . As in other situations where there is only horizontal acceleration, the vertical forces cancel. The ground exerts an upward for ce \( \vb{N} \) on the system that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight, \( \vb{w} \) . The system here is the sled, its rockets, and rider, so none of the forces between these objects are considered. The arrow representing friction ( \( \vb{f} \) ) is drawn larger than scale.")
{: #Figure4}

**Strategy**

Although there are forces acting vertically and horizontally, we assume the
vertical forces cancel since there is no vertical acceleration. This leaves us
with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional problem. Directions
are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right taken as the positive
direction. See the free-body diagram in the figure.

**Solution**

Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with
Newton’s second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the engines. Since
we have defined the direction of the force and acceleration as acting “to the
right,” we need to consider only the magnitudes of these quantities in the
calculations. Hence, we begin with

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=ma , $$
</div>
where $$ F_{\text{net}} $$ is the net force along the horizontal direction. We can see
from [Example 2](#example2) that the engine thrusts add, while friction
opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=4T-f. $$
</div>
Substituting this into Newton’s second law gives

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=ma =4T-f. $$
</div>
Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust, $$ 4 T $$ :

<div class="equation">
 $$ 4T=ma + f . $$
</div>
Substituting known values yields

<div class="equation">
 $$ 4T=ma +f=\left(2100 \kg \right)\left(49 \mss \right)+650 \N . $$
</div>
So the total thrust is

<div class="equation">
 $$ 4T=1.0\times 10^{5}\N , $$
</div>
and the individual thrusts are

<div class="equation">
 $$ T=\frac{1.0\times 10^{5}\N }{4}=2.6\times 10^{4}\N . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such
as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the limits of human endurance
and the setup designed to protect human subjects in jet fighter emergency
ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45 $$ g $$
\'s. (Recall that $$ g $$, the acceleration due to gravity, is $$ 9.80 \mss $$.
When we say that an acceleration is 45 $$ g $$ \'s, it is $$ 45\times 9.80 \mss $$, which is approximately $$ 440 \mss $$.) While living subjects are not used
any more, land speeds of 10 000 km/h have been obtained with rocket sleds. In
this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We
will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial - and
the choice is not always obvious.

Newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a relationship
among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make predictions. Each of
those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law tells
us something basic and universal about nature. The next section introduces the
third and final law of motion.

#### Section Summary

* Acceleration, $$ \vb{a} $$, is defined as a change in velocity, meaning a
  change in its magnitude or direction, or both.
* An external force is one acting on a system from outside the system, as
  opposed to internal forces, which act between components within the system.
* Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of a system is
  directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force
  acting on the system, and inversely proportional to its mass.
* In equation form, Newton’s second law of motion is $$ \vb{a}=\frac{ \vb{F}_ {\text{net}}}{m} $$.
* This is often written in the more familiar form:
  $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$.
* The weight $$ \vb{w} $$ of an object is defined as the force of gravity acting
  on an object of mass $$ m $$. The object experiences an acceleration due to
  gravity $$ \vb{g} $$:
  <div class="equation">
  $$ \vb{w}=m\vb{g}. $$
  </div>

* If the only force acting on an object is due to gravity, the object is in free
  fall.
* Friction is a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that
  are touching.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A 63.0-kg sprinter starts a race with an acceleration of $$ 4.20 \mss $$.
What is the net external force on him?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Apply Newton's second law directly. Given mass and acceleration, calculate the net force using $$ F_{net} = ma $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Mass: $$ m = 63.0 \kg $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = 4.20 \mss $$

2. Apply Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{net} = ma = (63.0 \kg)(4.20 \mss) = 265 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This force comes from the sprinter pushing backward on the ground, and the ground pushing forward on the sprinter (Newton's third law). The 265 N represents the net horizontal force after accounting for any friction and air resistance.

The net external force on the sprinter is $$ 265 \N $$.

Break the problem into two phases: (1) acceleration phase for 20 m, and (2) constant velocity phase for the remaining 80 m. Calculate time for each phase separately.

**Solution**

**Phase 1: Accelerating for 20 m**

Given: $$ a = 4.20 \mss $$, $$ x = 20 \m $$, $$ v_0 = 0 $$

1. Find the final velocity after accelerating:
<div class="equation">
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ax = 0 + 2(4.20 \mss)(20 \m) = 168 \mmss $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \sqrt{168 \mmss} = 12.96 \ms $$
</div>

2. Find the time for the acceleration phase:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = v_0 + at_1 \Rightarrow t_1 = \frac{v - v_0}{a} = \frac{12.96 \ms}{4.20 \mss} = 3.09 \s $$
</div>

**Phase 2: Constant velocity for 80 m**

3. Calculate the time at constant velocity:
<div class="equation">
$$ t_2 = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{80 \m}{12.96 \ms} = 6.17 \s $$
</div>

**Total time:**

<div class="equation">
$$ t_{total} = t_1 + t_2 = 3.09 \s + 6.17 \s = 9.26 \s $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This time of about 9.3 seconds is close to world-class 100-m dash times, which are under 10 seconds. The model is simplified because real sprinters don't accelerate uniformly and don't maintain exactly constant velocity.

The sprinter's time for the 100-m dash would be approximately $$ 9.26 \s $$.

A cleaner pushes a 4.50-kg laundry cart in such a way that the net external
force on it is 60.0 N. Calculate the magnitude of its acceleration.

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use Newton's second law to find acceleration when force and mass are given. Rearrange $$ F_{net} = ma $$ to solve for $$ a $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Mass: $$ m = 4.50 \kg $$
   - Net external force: $$ F_{net} = 60.0 \N $$

2. Rearrange Newton's second law to solve for acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \frac{60.0 \N}{4.50 \kg} = \frac{60.0 \kg \cdot \mss}{4.50 \kg} = 13.3 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is a fairly large acceleration—about 1.4 times the acceleration due to gravity. The cart would reach a speed of 13.3 m/s (about 48 km/h) after just one second if this acceleration were maintained.

The laundry cart accelerates at $$ 13.3 \mss $$.

Since astronauts in orbit are apparently weightless, a clever method of
measuring their masses is needed to monitor their mass gains or losses to
adjust diets. One way to do this is to exert a known force on an astronaut
and measure the acceleration produced. Suppose a net external force of 50.0 N
is exerted and the astronaut's acceleration is measured to be $$ 0.893 \mss $$.
(a) Calculate her mass.
(b) By exerting a force on the astronaut, the vehicle
in which they orbit experiences an equal and opposite force. Discuss how this
would affect the measurement of the astronaut's acceleration. Propose a method
in which recoil of the vehicle is avoided.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), use Newton's second law rearranged to solve for mass. For part (b), consider the effect of the vehicle's motion on the measurement.

**Solution**

**(a) Calculate the astronaut's mass:**

1. Identify the known values:
   - Net force: $$ F_{net} = 50.0 \N $$
   - Acceleration: $$ a = 0.893 \mss $$

2. Rearrange Newton's second law to solve for mass:
<div class="equation">
$$ m = \frac{F_{net}}{a} = \frac{50.0 \N}{0.893 \mss} = \frac{50.0 \kg \cdot \mss}{0.893 \mss} = 56.0 \kg $$
</div>

**(b) Effect of vehicle recoil:**

By Newton's third law, when the device exerts a 50.0 N force on the astronaut, the astronaut exerts a 50.0 N force back on the device and vehicle. This causes the vehicle to accelerate in the opposite direction.

If the measurement is made relative to the vehicle, the measured acceleration would appear larger than the true acceleration relative to an inertial reference frame, leading to an underestimate of the astronaut's mass.

**Proposed method to avoid recoil:** Anchor the force-exerting device to a very massive part of the spacecraft, or use a spring-loaded chair system where the astronaut oscillates on a spring (Body Mass Measurement Device). The oscillation period depends on mass but doesn't require the vehicle to absorb any net force.

**Discussion**

The actual Space Shuttle and ISS use a device where astronauts sit in a chair attached to springs. The period of oscillation is measured and used to calculate mass, avoiding the recoil problem entirely.

(a) The astronaut's mass is $$ 56.0 \kg $$.

(b) Vehicle recoil would cause errors in the acceleration measurement. Using an oscillating spring system avoids this problem.

In [Figure 3](#Figure3), the net external force on the 24-kg mower is stated to be 51 N.
If the force of friction opposing the motion is 24 N, what force $$ F $$
(in newtons) is the person exerting on the mower? Suppose the mower is moving at
1.5 m/s when the force $$ F $$ is removed. How far will the mower go before
stopping?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First, find the force the person exerts using the relationship between applied force, friction, and net force. Then, when the applied force is removed, use Newton's second law to find the deceleration due to friction alone, and use kinematics to find the stopping distance.

**Solution**

**Part 1: Force exerted by person**

The net force is the applied force minus friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F - f $$
</div>

Solving for $$ F $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = F_{\text{net}} + f = 51 \N + 24 \N = 75 \N $$
</div>

**Part 2: Stopping distance**

When the applied force is removed, only friction acts, so:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = -f = -24 \N $$
</div>

The acceleration (deceleration) is:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{-24 \N}{24 \kg} = -1.0 \mss $$
</div>

Using the kinematic equation $$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ax $$ with $$ v = 0 $$, $$ v_0 = 1.5 \ms $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = (1.5 \ms)^2 + 2(-1.0 \mss)x $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ x = \frac{(1.5 \ms)^2}{2(1.0 \mss)} = \frac{2.25 \mmss}{2.0 \mss} = 1.1 \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The person must exert 75 N to overcome 24 N of friction and produce a net force of 51 N. When pushing stops, friction decelerates the mower at 1.0 m/s², bringing it to rest in about one meter.

**Answer**

The person exerts a force of **75 N** on the mower. After the force is removed, the mower will travel **1.1 m** before stopping.

The same rocket sled drawn in [Figure 5](#Figure5) is decelerated at a rate of
$$ 196 \mss $$.
What force is necessary to produce this deceleration? Assume that the rockets
are off. The mass of the system is 2100 kg.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use Newton's second law to find the force needed to produce the given deceleration. The deceleration is negative acceleration, so the force will be in the direction opposite to the motion.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$ m = 2100 \kg $$
- Deceleration: $$ a = -196 \mss $$ (negative because it opposes motion)

Apply Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = ma = (2100 \kg)(-196 \mss) = -4.12 \times 10^{5} \N $$
</div>

The magnitude of the force is:
<div class="equation">
$$ |F| = 4.12 \times 10^{5} \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is an enormous force—about 412,000 N—needed to decelerate the sled at 20 times the acceleration due to gravity (196 m/s² ÷ 9.8 m/s² ≈ 20g). This force would come from air brakes, parachutes, or other braking mechanisms. The negative sign indicates the force opposes the direction of motion.

**Answer**

A force of **4.12 × 10⁵ N** (or **412 kN**) in the direction opposite to the motion is necessary to produce this deceleration.

(a) If the rocket sled shown in [Figure 6](#Figure6) starts with only one rocket
burning, what is the magnitude of
its acceleration? Assume that the mass of the system is 2100 kg,
the thrust T is $$ 2.59\times 10^{4} \N $$, and the force of friction opposing the motion is known to be 650 N.
(b) Why is the acceleration not one-fourth of what it is with all rockets burning?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), use Newton's second law to find the acceleration. The net force equals thrust minus friction. For part (b), consider how both the driving force and the opposing friction force affect the net force and resulting acceleration.

**Solution**

**(a) Acceleration with one rocket:**

Given:
- Mass of system: $$ m = 2100 \kg $$
- Thrust from one rocket: $$ T = 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N $$
- Friction force: $$ f = 650 \N $$

The net force is the thrust minus friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = T - f = 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N - 650 \N = 25{,}250 \N $$
</div>

Apply Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{25{,}250 \N}{2100 \kg} = 12.0 \mss $$
</div>

**(b) Why not one-fourth of the acceleration with four rockets:**

If all four rockets were burning, the thrust would be $$ 4 \times 2.59 \times 10^{4} \N = 1.036 \times 10^{5} \N $$.

Net force with four rockets:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net, 4}} = 103{,}600 \N - 650 \N = 102{,}950 \N $$
</div>

Acceleration with four rockets:
<div class="equation">
$$ a_4 = \frac{102{,}950 \N}{2100 \kg} = 49.0 \mss $$
</div>

One-fourth of this would be:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{a_4}{4} = \frac{49.0 \mss}{4} = 12.25 \mss $$
</div>

Our calculated acceleration (12.0 m/s²) is close to but slightly less than one-fourth of $$ a_4 $$ because friction remains constant. When we reduce the thrust to one-fourth, the friction becomes proportionally more significant. The friction of 650 N represents 0.63% of the total thrust with four rockets but 2.5% of the thrust with one rocket.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates an important principle: when both driving and opposing forces are present, reducing the driving force doesn't reduce the acceleration proportionally. The friction force remains constant regardless of thrust, so it has a larger relative impact when thrust is reduced. This is why vehicles need disproportionately more power to achieve higher speeds—resistance forces remain significant throughout.

**Answer**

(a) The magnitude of the acceleration with one rocket is **12.0 m/s²**.

(b) The acceleration is not one-fourth of what it was with all rockets burning because the frictional force remains constant at 650 N, which becomes proportionally more significant when the thrust is reduced.

What is the deceleration of the rocket sled if it comes to rest in 1.1 s

(Such deceleration caused one test subject to black out and have temporary blindness.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Convert the initial speed from km/h to m/s, then use the definition of acceleration: $$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - v_0}{t} $$.

**Solution**

1. Convert initial speed to m/s:
<div class="equation">
$$ v_0 = 1000 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{1000 \m}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \s} = 278 \ms $$
</div>

2. Calculate the deceleration:
   - Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 278 \ms $$
   - Final velocity: $$ v = 0 \ms $$
   - Time: $$ t = 1.1 \s $$

<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{v - v_0}{t} = \frac{0 - 278 \ms}{1.1 \s} = -253 \mss $$

The magnitude of the deceleration is:
<div class="equation">
$$ |a| = 253 \mss = 25.8g $$

where $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$.

**Discussion**

This deceleration of about 26g is extremely severe. For comparison, fighter pilots typically experience 3-9g during maneuvers, and anything above 20g can cause serious injury or death. The negative effects mentioned (blackout and temporary blindness) are due to blood being forced away from the brain and eyes under such extreme deceleration.

Suppose two children push horizontally, but in exactly opposite directions, on a third child in a wagon.
The first child exerts a force of 75.0 N, the second a force of 90.0 N, friction is 12.0 N, and the mass of the third child plus wagon is 23.0 kg.
(a) What is the system of interest if the acceleration of the child in the wagon is to be calculated?
(b) Draw a free-body diagram, including all forces acting on the system.
(c) Calculate the acceleration.
(d) What would the acceleration be if friction were 15.0 N?

**Strategy**

Identify the system, draw a free-body diagram showing all forces, find the net force, and apply Newton's second law. The forces include the pushes from both children (in opposite directions), friction (opposing motion), weight, and normal force.

**Solution**

**(a) System of interest:**

The system is the child in the wagon plus the wagon. This is the object whose acceleration we want to calculate, so we must include all external forces acting on it.

**(b) Free-body diagram:**

![An object represented as a dot labeled m is shown at the center. One force represented by an arrow labeled as vector F sub 2 acts toward the right. Another force represented by an arrow labeled as vector F sub 1 having a slightly shorter length in comparison with F sub 2 acts on the object pointing left. A friction force represented by an arrow labeled as vector f having a small length acts on the object toward the left. Weight, represented by an arrow labeled as vector W, acts on the object downward, and normal force, represented by an arrow labeled as vector N, acts upward, having the same length as W.](../resources/Figure_04_03_06.jpg)
{: #Figure7}

The diagram shows:
- $$ F_1 = 75.0 \N $$ (to the left)
- $$ F_2 = 90.0 \N $$ (to the right)
- $$ f = 12.0 \N $$ (friction, opposing motion—to the left since net push is rightward)
- $$ W $$ (weight, downward)
- $$ N $$ (normal force, upward, equal to weight since no vertical acceleration)

**(c) Calculate the acceleration:**

Given:
- First child's force: $$ F_1 = 75.0 \N $$ (leftward)
- Second child's force: $$ F_2 = 90.0 \N $$ (rightward)
- Friction: $$ f = 12.0 \N $$ (opposing motion)
- Mass: $$ m = 23.0 \kg $$

The net horizontal force (taking rightward as positive):
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_2 - F_1 - f = 90.0 \N - 75.0 \N - 12.0 \N = 3.0 \N $$
</div>

Apply Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{3.0 \N}{23.0 \kg} = 0.130 \mss $$
</div>

The acceleration is in the direction of the second child's push (rightward).

**(d) Acceleration if friction were 15.0 N:**

With increased friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = 90.0 \N - 75.0 \N - 15.0 \N = 0 \N $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{0 \N}{23.0 \kg} = 0 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates how multiple forces combine to produce acceleration. The children push in opposite directions, creating a net push of only 15 N (90 N – 75 N). Friction further reduces this to 3 N, resulting in a small acceleration. In part (d), when friction increases to 15 N, it exactly balances the net push, resulting in zero acceleration—the wagon would move at constant velocity if already moving, or remain at rest if initially at rest. This demonstrates the equilibrium condition where $$ F_{\text{net}} = 0 $$.

**Answer**

(a) The system of interest is **the child in the wagon plus the wagon**.

(b) The free-body diagram is shown above in Figure 7.

(c) The acceleration is **0.130 m/s²** in the direction of the second child's push (the stronger push).

(d) If friction were 15.0 N, the acceleration would be **0.00 m/s²** (zero), as the forces would be balanced.

A powerful motorcycle can produce an acceleration of $$ 3.50\mss $$

to air friction. It always opposes the motion of an object.) What is the
magnitude of the force the motorcycle exerts backward on the ground to produce
its acceleration if the mass of the motorcycle with rider is 245 kg?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The net force produces the acceleration. The force the ground exerts on the motorcycle (forward) must overcome the resistive forces and provide the net force for acceleration. By Newton's third law, the motorcycle exerts an equal and opposite force backward on the ground.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$ m = 245 \kg $$
- Acceleration: $$ a = 3.50 \mss $$
- Resistive forces: $$ f = 400 \N $$

1. Calculate the net force using Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = ma = (245 \kg)(3.50 \mss) = 858 \N $$
</div>

2. The net force is the difference between the forward force from the ground $$ F_{\text{ground}} $$ and the resistive forces:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{ground}} - f $$
</div>

3. Solve for the force from the ground:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{ground}} = F_{\text{net}} + f = 858 \N + 400 \N = 1258 \N \approx 1260 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

By Newton's third law, if the ground exerts 1260 N forward on the motorcycle (through the tires), the motorcycle exerts 1260 N backward on the ground. This force must be large enough to both overcome the 400 N of resistance and provide the additional 858 N needed for acceleration.

using a ratio.
(b) Calculate the direction and magnitude of the total force the
seat exerts against his body.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), use Newton's second law to find the horizontal force needed to accelerate the passenger. Compare this to his weight. For part (b), combine the horizontal and vertical components (vertical component equals weight to support the passenger) to find the total force magnitude and direction.

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass of passenger: $$ m = 75.0 \kg $$
- Acceleration: $$ a = 49.0 \mss $$

**(a) Horizontal component of force and comparison to weight:**

The horizontal force needed to accelerate the passenger:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{horizontal}} = ma = (75.0 \kg)(49.0 \mss) = 3675 \N \approx 3.68 \times 10^{3} \N $$
</div>

Calculate the passenger's weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ w = mg = (75.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 735 \N $$
</div>

Compare using a ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F_{\text{horizontal}}}{w} = \frac{3675 \N}{735 \N} = 5.00 $$
</div>

**(b) Total force magnitude and direction:**

The seat must exert two force components:
- Horizontal: $$ F_{\text{horizontal}} = 3675 \N $$ (forward, to accelerate the passenger)
- Vertical: $$ F_{\text{vertical}} = 735 \N $$ (upward, to support the passenger's weight)

Total force magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{F_{\text{horizontal}}^2 + F_{\text{vertical}}^2} = \sqrt{(3675)^2 + (735)^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{13{,}505{,}625 + 540{,}225} = \sqrt{14{,}045{,}850} = 3748 \N \approx 3750 \N $$
</div>

Direction above horizontal:
<div class="equation">
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F_{\text{vertical}}}{F_{\text{horizontal}}}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{735}{3675}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.200) = 11.3^\circ $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The passenger experiences a force 5 times his own weight just from the horizontal acceleration alone. This represents an acceleration of 5g (since 49.0 m/s² ÷ 9.8 m/s² ≈ 5). The total force is only slightly larger than the horizontal component because the vertical component (supporting his weight) is relatively small. The force is directed 11.3° above horizontal, meaning the seat back pushes him forward and slightly upward. This is similar to what you feel when accelerating rapidly in a car—you're pushed back into the seat.

**Answer**

(a) The horizontal component of the force the seat exerts is **3.68 × 10³ N** (or **3675 N**), which is **5.00 times** greater than his weight.

(b) The total force the seat exerts is **3750 N** directed **11.3° above horizontal**.

$$ w = mg = (75.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 735 \N $$
</div>

Ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{F_{\text{horizontal}}}{w} = \frac{15{,}100 \N}{735 \N} = 20.5 $$
</div>

**(b) Total force magnitude and direction:**

The vertical component equals the passenger's weight (upward): $$ F_{\text{vertical}} = 735 \N $$

The horizontal component (backward, opposing motion): $$ F_{\text{horizontal}} = 1.51 \times 10^{4} \N $$

Total force magnitude:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{F_{\text{horizontal}}^2 + F_{\text{vertical}}^2} = \sqrt{(1.51 \times 10^{4})^2 + (735)^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{2.28 \times 10^{8} + 5.40 \times 10^{5}} = \sqrt{2.29 \times 10^{8}} = 1.51 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Direction below horizontal:
<div class="equation">
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F_{\text{vertical}}}{F_{\text{horizontal}}}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{735}{15{,}100}\right) = 2.79^\circ $$
</div>

**Discussion**

During deceleration, the seat and belts must push forward on the passenger (opposite to the sled's motion) with tremendous force—over 20 times the passenger's weight. The vertical component is small compared to the horizontal, so the total force is directed nearly horizontally (only 2.79° below horizontal).

**Answer**

(a) The horizontal component of the force is **1.51 × 10⁴ N**, which is **20.5 times** the passenger's weight.

(b) The total force is **1.51 × 10⁴ N** directed **2.79° below horizontal** (or below the backward direction).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The weight of an astronaut plus his space suit on the Moon is only 250 N.
How much do they weigh on Earth? What is the mass on the Moon? On Earth?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the relationship between weight, mass, and gravitational acceleration: $$ w = mg $$. On the Moon, we know the weight and can find the mass. Mass is invariant (same everywhere), so we can then calculate the Earth weight using Earth's gravitational acceleration.

**Solution**

Given:
- Weight on Moon: $$ w_{\text{Moon}} = 250 \N $$
- Moon's gravity: $$ g_{\text{Moon}} = 1.67 \mss $$
- Earth's gravity: $$ g_{\text{Earth}} = 9.80 \mss $$

**Find the mass:**

From $$ w = mg $$, we can solve for mass:
<div class="equation">
$$ m = \frac{w_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Moon}}} = \frac{250 \N}{1.67 \mss} = 150 \kg $$
</div>

**Mass on the Moon and Earth:**

Mass is an intrinsic property of matter and does not change with location. Therefore:
- Mass on Moon: $$ m = 150 \kg $$
- Mass on Earth: $$ m = 150 \kg $$

**Weight on Earth:**

Using the mass and Earth's gravitational acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ w_{\text{Earth}} = mg_{\text{Earth}} = (150 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 1470 \N \approx 1.5 \times 10^{3} \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the important distinction between mass and weight. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter and remains constant regardless of location. Weight, however, is the gravitational force acting on that mass and depends on the local gravitational field strength. The Moon's gravity is approximately 1/6 that of Earth's (1.67 m/s² compared to 9.80 m/s²), so objects weigh about 1/6 as much on the Moon as they do on Earth. The ratio is: 250 N / 1470 N ≈ 0.17 ≈ 1/6.

**Answer**

The astronaut and space suit weigh **1.5 × 10³ N** (or **1470 N**) on Earth. The mass is **150 kg** on both the Moon and Earth, since mass does not change with location.

Suppose the mass of a fully loaded module in which astronauts take off
from the Moon is 10 000 kg. The thrust of its engines is 30 000 N.
(a) Calculate its the magnitude of acceleration in a vertical takeoff from the Moon.
(b) Could it lift off from Earth? If not, why not? If it could, calculate the magnitude of its acceleration.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For vertical takeoff, the net force is thrust minus weight. Use Newton's second law to find acceleration. Compare the thrust to the weight on the Moon (part a) and on Earth (part b).

**Solution**

Given:
- Mass: $$ m = 10{,}000 \kg $$
- Thrust: $$ T = 30{,}000 \N $$
- Moon's gravity: $$ g_{\text{Moon}} = 1.67 \mss $$
- Earth's gravity: $$ g_{\text{Earth}} = 9.80 \mss $$

**(a) Acceleration on the Moon:**

Weight on Moon:
<div class="equation">
$$ w_{\text{Moon}} = mg_{\text{Moon}} = (10{,}000 \kg)(1.67 \mss) = 1.67 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Net force (upward positive):
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = T - w_{\text{Moon}} = 30{,}000 \N - 16{,}700 \N = 13{,}300 \N $$
</div>

Acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{13{,}300 \N}{10{,}000 \kg} = 1.33 \mss $$
</div>

**(b) Could it lift off from Earth?**

Weight on Earth:
<div class="equation">
$$ w_{\text{Earth}} = mg_{\text{Earth}} = (10{,}000 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 9.80 \times 10^{4} \N $$
</div>

Compare thrust to weight:
- Thrust: $$ 30{,}000 \N $$
- Weight: $$ 98{,}000 \N $$

Since the thrust (30,000 N) is less than the weight (98,000 N), the module **cannot lift off from Earth**.

Net force would be:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = T - w_{\text{Earth}} = 30{,}000 \N - 98{,}000 \N = -68{,}000 \N $$
</div>

The negative net force means the module would remain on the ground.

**Discussion**

The lunar module is specifically designed for the Moon's weak gravity (1/6 of Earth's). Its engines provide enough thrust to overcome lunar gravity with a comfortable margin, producing 1.33 m/s² of upward acceleration. However, on Earth, the same engines would need to produce at least 98,000 N just to hover, and they can only produce 30,000 N—less than one-third of what's needed.

**Answer**

(a) The module's acceleration during takeoff from the Moon is **1.33 m/s²**.

(b) **No, it could not lift off from Earth** because the thrust (30,000 N) is less than the module's weight on Earth (98,000 N).

mathematically as $$ \vb{a}=\frac{ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}}{m} $$

system
: defined by the boundaries of an object or collection of objects being
observed; all forces originating from outside of the system are considered
external forces

weight
: the force $$ \vb{w} $$ due to gravity acting on an object of mass $$ m $$;
defined mathematically as: $$ \vb{w}=m\vb{g} $$, where $$ \vb{g} $$ is the
