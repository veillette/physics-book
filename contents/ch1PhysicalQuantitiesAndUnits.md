The range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the
incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the age of the Earth, from the tiny
sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known
universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth
and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even
the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities
and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more
deeply than does qualitative description alone. To comprehend these vast ranges,
we must also have accepted units in which to express them. And we shall find
that (even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and
seconds) a profound simplicity of nature appears—all physical quantities can be
expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities: length,
mass, time, and electric current.

We define a **physical quantity**
either by _specifying how it is measured_
or by **stating how it is calculated** from other measurements. For example, we
define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, whereas we
define **average speed** by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled
divided by time of travel.

Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of **units**, which
are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical
quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for
distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult
for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way. (
See [Figure 2](#Figure2).)

There are two major systems of units used in the world: **SI units**
(also known as the metric system) and **English units**
(also known as the customary or imperial system).
**English units**
were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still
widely used in the United States. Virtually every other country in the world now
uses SI units as the standard; the metric system is also the standard system
agreed upon by scientists and mathematicians. The acronym “SI” is derived from
the French _Système International_.

### SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units

[Table 1](#Table1) gives the fundamental SI units that are used throughout this
textbook. This text uses non-SI units in a few applications where they are in
very common use, such as the measurement of blood pressure in millimeters of
mercury (mm Hg). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they will be tied to SI
units through conversions.

#### Table 1: Fundamental SI Units

| Length    | Mass          | Time       | Electric Current |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| meter (m) | kilogram (kg) | second (s) | ampere (A)       |

{: #Table1}

It is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than
others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined **only**
in terms of the procedure used to measure them. The units in which they are
measured are thus called **fundamental units**. In this textbook, the
fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length, mass, time, and electric
current. (Note that electric current will not be introduced until much later in
this text.) All other physical quantities, such as force and electric charge,
can be expressed as algebraic combinations of length, mass, time, and current (
for example, speed is length divided by time); these units are called **derived
units**.

### Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram

#### The Second

The SI unit for time, the **second**(
abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86 400 of
a mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater
accuracy and to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant,
physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer due to very gradual
slowing of the Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very
steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967
the second was redefined as the time required for 9 192 631 770 of these
vibrations. (See [Figure 3](#Figure3).) Accuracy in the fundamental units is
essential, because all measurements are ultimately expressed in terms of
fundamental units and can be no more accurate than are the fundamental units
themselves.

The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image is looking down from the top of an atomic fountain nearly 30 feet tall! (credit: Steve Jurvetson/Flickr)')
{: #Figure3 height="225"}

#### The Meter

The SI unit for length is the **meter** (abbreviated m); its definition has also
changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first
defined in 1791 as 1/10 000 000 of the distance from the equator to the North
Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the
distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar now kept near
Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately
in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1 650 763.73
wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was
given its present definition (partly for greater accuracy) as the distance light
travels in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second. (
See [Figure 4](#Figure4).) This change defines the speed of light to be exactly 299
792 458 meters per second. The length of the meter will change if the speed of
light is someday measured with greater accuracy.

#### The Kilogram

The SI unit for mass is the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg); it was previously
defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter
standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact
replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’
National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in
Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around
the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a
comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was
resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its
surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific
community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now
defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, $$h $$ (a
quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).

Electric current and its accompanying unit, the ampere, will be introduced in
later units when electricity and magnetism are covered. The initial modules in
this textbook are concerned with mechanics. In this subject all pertinent
physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the fundamental units of
length, mass, and time.

### Metric Prefixes

SI units are part of the **metric system**. The metric system is convenient for
scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by
factors of 10.
[Table 2](#Table2) gives metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various
factors of 10.

Metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers
of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so
on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system of U.S. customary units, the
relationships are not as simple—there are 12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a
mile, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit
can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by using an appropriate
metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction,
while distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and the tiny
measure of nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system
there is no need to invent new units for particular applications.

The term **order of magnitude**
refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system. Each power of $$ 10 $$ in the metric system represents a different order of magnitude. For
example, $$ 10^{1},10^{2},10^{3} $$, and so forth are all different orders of
magnitude. All quantities that can be expressed as a product of a specific power
of $$ 10 $$ are said to be of the **same** order of magnitude. For example, the
number $$ 800 $$ can be written as $$ 8\times 10^{2} $$, and the number $$ 450 $$ can be written as $$ 4.5\times 10^{2} $$. Thus, the numbers $$ 800 $$ and $$
450 $$ are of the same order of magnitude: $$ 10^{2} $$. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of $$ 10^{-9}\m $$, while the diameter of the Sun is on
the order of $$ 10^{9}\m $$.

The Quest for Microscopic Standards for Basic Units
</div>
The fundamental units described in this chapter are those that produce the greatest accuracy and precision in measurement.
There is a sense among physicists that, because there is an underlying microscopic substructure to matter,
it would be most satisfying to base our standards of measurement on microscopic objects and fundamental physical
phenomena such as the speed of light. A microscopic standard has been accomplished for the standard of time,
which is based on the oscillations of the cesium atom.

The standard for length was once based on the wavelength of light (a small-scale
length) emitted by a certain type of atom, but it has been supplanted by the
more precise measurement of the speed of light. If it becomes possible to
measure the mass of atoms or a particular arrangement of atoms such as a silicon
sphere to greater precision than the kilogram standard, it may become possible
to base mass measurements on the small scale. There are also possibilities that
electrical phenomena on the small scale may someday allow us to base a unit of
charge on the charge of electrons and protons, but at present current and charge
are related to large-scale currents and forces between wires.

### Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time

The vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are
illustrated by the wide range of examples of known lengths, masses, and times
in [Table 3](#Table3). Examination of this table will give you some feeling for
the range of possible topics and numerical values. (
See [Figure 5](#Figure5) and [Figure 6](#Figure6).)

### Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis

It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example,
if you are reading a European cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in
units of liters, and you need to convert them to cups. Or, perhaps you are
reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested
in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you will need to convert
units of feet to miles.

Let us consider a simple example of how to convert units. Let us say that we
want to convert 80 meters (m) to kilometers (km).

The first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you
want to convert to. In this case, we have units in **meters** and we want to
convert to **kilometers**.

Next, we need to determine a **conversion factor** relating meters to
kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are
equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100
centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute, and so on. In this case, we know
that there are 1 000 meters in 1 kilometer.

Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and
then multiply them by the conversion factor so that the units cancel out, as
shown:

<div class="equation">
  $$ 80 \m ×\frac{1 \text{km}}{1000\m }=0.080\text{km}.
 $$
</div>

Note that the unwanted m unit cancels, leaving only the desired km unit. You can
use this method to convert between any types of unit.

The [Appendix](./appendixA) has a more complete list of
conversion factors.

Unit Conversions: A Short Drive Home
</div>
Suppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your university to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed
(a) in kilometers per hour (km/h) and
(b) in meters per second (m/s).
(Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)

**Strategy**

First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the
average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factor
and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the
unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time
of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now—average speed and other
motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form,

<div class="equation">
  $$ \text{average speed =}\frac{ \text{distance}}{\text{time}}.  $$
</div>
(2) Substitute the given values for distance and time.

<div class="equation">
  $$ \text{average speed} =\frac{10.0\text{km}}{20.0\text{min}}=0.500\frac{ \text{km}}{\text{min}}.  $$
</div>
(3) Convert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours.
That conversion factor is  $$ 60 \text{min/hr}  $$. Thus,

<div class="equation">
  $$ \text{average speed} = 0.500\frac{ \text{km}}{\text{min}}×\frac{60 \text
{ min}}{1\text{h}}=30.0\frac{ \text{km}}{\text{h}}.  $$
</div>

**Discussion for (a)**

To check your answer, consider the following:

(1) Be sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion.
If you have written the unit conversion factor upside down, the units will not
cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down,
then the units will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as
follows:

<div class="equation">
  $$ \frac{ \text{km}}{\text{min}}×\frac{1\text{hr}}{60 \text{min}}
=\frac{1}{60}\frac{ \text{km}\cdot \text{hr}}{ {\text{min}}^{2}},  $$
</div>
which are obviously not the desired units of km/h.

(2) Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem
asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained
these units.

(3) Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the
problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three
significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/hr does indeed have three significant
figures, so this is appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the
conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is
_defined_ to be 60 minutes, so the precision of the conversion factor is
perfect.

(4) Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some
information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min),
you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem
reasonable.

**Solution for (b)**

There are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second.

(1) Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors
are needed—one to convert hours to seconds, and another to convert kilometers to
meters.

(2) Multiplying by these yields

<div class="equation">
  $$ \text{Average speed}=30.0\frac{ \text{km}}{\text{h}}×\frac{1\text{h}}{3 600 \s  }×\frac{1 000 \m }{1 \text{km}},  $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
  $$ \text{Average speed}=8.33\frac{ \m }{\s}.  $$
</div>

**Discussion for (b)**

If we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion
factors, but the answer would have been the same: 8.33 m/s.

You may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were
given to three digits. Why? When do you need to be concerned about the number of
digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits your
calculator produces? The

Nonstandard Units
</div>
While there are numerous types of units that we are all familiar with, there are
others that are much more obscure. For example, a **firkin** is a unit of volume
that was once used to measure beer. One firkin equals about 34 liters. To learn
more about nonstandard units, use a dictionary or encyclopedia to research different
“weights and measures.” Take note of any unusual units, such as a barleycorn,
that are not listed in the text.

### Summary

- Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be
  measured or calculated from other measurements.
- Units are standards for expressing and comparing the measurement of physical
  quantities. All units can be expressed as combinations of four fundamental
  units.
- The four fundamental units we will use in this text are the meter (for length)
  , the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric
  current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10
  to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature.
- The four fundamental units are abbreviated as follows: meter, m; kilogram, kg;
  second, s; and ampere, A. The metric system also uses a standard set of
  prefixes to denote each order of magnitude greater than or lesser than the
  fundamental unit itself.
- Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to
  another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are
  ratios relating equal quantities of different units.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
The speed limit on some interstate highways is roughly 100 km/h.
(a) What is this in meters per second?
(b) How many miles per hour is this?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Use conversion factors to convert between units. Remember: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 hour = 3600 s, and 1 km = 0.6214 miles.

**Solution**

**(a) Convert 100 km/h to m/s:**

<div class="equation">
$$ 100 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{1000 \m}{1 \text{km}} \times \frac{1 \text{h}}{3600 \s} = \frac{100 \times 1000}{3600} \frac{\m}{\s} = 27.8 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Convert 100 km/h to miles per hour:**

<div class="equation">
$$ 100 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{0.6214 \text{ mi}}{1 \text{km}} = 62.1 \text{ mph} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The conversion from km/h to m/s requires two conversion factors that work together to change both the distance and time units. The result of 27.8 m/s means the car travels about 28 meters in one second, which is reasonable for highway speeds. Both answers maintain three significant figures, matching the precision of the original measurement of 100 km/h.

(a) $$ 27.8 \ms $$

(b) $$ 62.1 \text{mph} $$

A car is traveling at a speed of  $$ 33  \ms  $$.
(a) What is its speed in kilometers per hour?
(b) Is it exceeding the  $$ 90 \text{km/h}  $$
speed limit?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Convert the speed from m/s to km/h using appropriate conversion factors, then compare with the speed limit.

**Solution**

**(a) Convert 33 m/s to km/h:**

<div class="equation">
$$ 33 \frac{\m}{\s} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \m} \times \frac{3600 \s}{1 \text{ h}} = \frac{33 \times 3600}{1000} \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} = 119 \text{ km/h} $$
</div>

Alternatively, using the conversion factor from Problem 3: 1.0 m/s = 3.6 km/h:

<div class="equation">
$$ 33 \ms \times 3.6 = 119 \text{ km/h} \approx 120 \text{ km/h} $$
</div>

**(b) Comparison with speed limit:**

Since 119 km/h > 90 km/h, yes, the car is exceeding the speed limit by 29 km/h.

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates the utility of the conversion factor 1.0 m/s = 3.6 km/h, which is commonly used in physics. The car's speed of 119 km/h is significantly over the 90 km/h limit, exceeding it by about 32%. This speed of 33 m/s means the car travels the length of a basketball court in less than one second, which helps put the speed in perspective.

**Answer**

(a) The car's speed is **120 km/h** (or 119 km/h to three significant figures).

(b) Yes, the car is exceeding the 90 km/h speed limit.

 $$ =3.6 \text{km/h}  $$.

**Discussion**

This conversion factor is particularly useful because it relates the SI unit of speed (m/s) to the more common everyday unit of km/h. The factor of 3.6 arises from the combination of 3600 seconds per hour and 1000 meters per kilometer (3600/1000 = 3.6). Memorizing this simple relationship allows for quick mental conversions between these common speed units.

American football is played on a 100-yd-long field, excluding the end zones. How long is the field in meters? (Assume that 1 meter equals 3.281 feet.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Convert from yards to feet, then from feet to meters using the given conversion factor.

**Solution**

1. Convert yards to feet (1 yard = 3 feet):
<div class="equation">
$$ 100 \text{ yd} \times \frac{3 \text{ ft}}{1 \text{ yd}} = 300 \text{ ft} $$
</div>

2. Convert feet to meters (1 m = 3.281 ft):
<div class="equation">
$$ 300 \text{ ft} \times \frac{1 \m}{3.281 \text{ ft}} = 91.4 \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The result shows that an American football field is slightly less than 100 meters long, which provides a useful reference point for estimating distances. The conversion required using two factors: first yards to feet (3 ft/yd), then feet to meters. The answer of 91.4 m is given to three significant figures, matching the precision of the original 100-yard measurement.

Soccer fields vary in size. A large soccer field is 115 m long and 85 m wide. What are its dimensions in feet and inches?
(Assume that 1 meter equals 3.281 feet.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Convert from meters to feet using the conversion factor 1 m = 3.281 ft, then convert feet to inches using 1 ft = 12 in.

**Solution**

**Length (115 m):**

<div class="equation">
$$ 115 \m \times \frac{3.281 \text{ ft}}{1 \m} = 377 \text{ ft} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 377 \text{ ft} \times \frac{12 \text{ in.}}{1 \text{ ft}} = 4.53 \times 10^{3} \text{ in.} $$
</div>

**Width (85 m):**

<div class="equation">
$$ 85 \m \times \frac{3.281 \text{ ft}}{1 \m} = 279 \text{ ft} \approx 280 \text{ ft} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 280 \text{ ft} \times \frac{12 \text{ in.}}{1 \text{ ft}} = 3.3 \times 10^{3} \text{ in.} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The soccer field dimensions in feet (377 ft by 280 ft) show that it is larger than an American football field in both length and width. Using scientific notation for the inch measurements (4.53 × 10³ in. and 3.3 × 10³ in.) is appropriate because these are large numbers that would be cumbersome to write out. The significant figures reflect the precision of the original metric measurements, with the width rounded to two significant figures based on the value 85 m.

**Answer**

Length: $$ 377 \text{ft} $$; $$ 4.53 \times 10^{3}\text{in.} $$

Width: $$ 280 \text{ft} $$; $$ 3.3\times 10^{3}\text{in.} $$

What is the height in meters of a person who is 6 ft 1.0 in. tall? (Assume that 1 meter equals 39.37 in.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

First convert the total height to inches, then convert to meters using the given conversion factor.

**Solution**

1. Convert 6 ft 1.0 in. to total inches:
<div class="equation">
$$ 6 \text{ ft} \times \frac{12 \text{ in.}}{1 \text{ ft}} + 1.0 \text{ in.} = 72 \text{ in.} + 1.0 \text{ in.} = 73.0 \text{ in.} $$
</div>

2. Convert inches to meters (1 m = 39.37 in.):
<div class="equation">
$$ 73.0 \text{ in.} \times \frac{1 \m}{39.37 \text{ in.}} = 1.85 \m $$
</div>

**Discussion**

A height of 1.85 m (or 185 cm) is reasonable for a person who is 6 ft 1 in. tall, representing a height above average for most populations. The conversion from English units to SI units demonstrates the importance of first combining mixed units (feet and inches) into a single unit before converting. The result is given to three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the original measurement.

**Answer**

The person's height is **1.85 m**.

**Strategy**

Convert from feet to kilometers using the given conversion factor: 1 km = 3281 ft.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
$$ 29028 \text{ ft} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{3281 \text{ ft}} = 8.847 \text{ km} $$

**Discussion**

Mount Everest's height of approximately 8.8 km helps put the mountain's scale into perspective—it reaches nearly 9 kilometers into the atmosphere. This height is significant because it places the summit in the "death zone" where atmospheric pressure is only about one-third that at sea level. The precision to four significant figures (8.847 km) reflects the accuracy of modern surveying techniques used to measure this iconic peak.

The speed of sound is measured to be  $$ 342  \ms  $$
on a certain day. What is this in km/h?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Convert the speed from m/s to km/h using the conversion factors: 1 km = 1000 m and 1 h = 3600 s.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
$$ 342 \frac{\m}{\s} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \m} \times \frac{3600 \s}{1 \text{ h}} = \frac{342 \times 3600}{1000} \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} = 1231 \text{ km/h} \approx 1230 \text{ km/h} $$
</div>

Alternatively, using the conversion 1.0 m/s = 3.6 km/h:

<div class="equation">
$$ 342 \ms \times 3.6 = 1231 \text{ km/h} \approx 1.23 \times 10^{3} \text{ km/h} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The speed of sound at approximately 1230 km/h is much faster than typical highway speeds (around 100 km/h) but still much slower than the speed of light. This value varies with temperature and atmospheric conditions, which is why the problem states it was "measured on a certain day." Expressing the answer with three significant figures (1230 km/h or 1.23 × 10³ km/h) properly reflects the precision of the original measurement of 342 m/s.

**Answer**

The speed of sound is **1230 km/h** (or **1.23 × 10³ km/h** in scientific notation).

(a) What distance does it move in 1 s at this speed?
(b) What is its speed in kilometers per million years?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Convert the speed of 4.0 cm/year to the requested units using appropriate conversion factors.

**Solution**

**(a) Distance moved in 1 second:**

First convert 4.0 cm/year to meters per second:

<div class="equation">
$$ 4.0 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{year}} \times \frac{1 \m}{100 \text{ cm}} \times \frac{1 \text{ year}}{365 \text{ days}} \times \frac{1 \text{ day}}{24 \text{ h}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ = \frac{4.0}{100 \times 365 \times 24 \times 3600} \frac{\m}{\s} = 1.27 \times 10^{-9} \frac{\m}{\s} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-9} \frac{\m}{\s} $$
</div>

In 1 second, the plate moves: $$ 1.3 \times 10^{-9} \m $$

**(b) Speed in km per million years:**

<div class="equation">
$$ 4.0 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{year}} \times \frac{1 \m}{100 \text{ cm}} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \m} \times \frac{10^{6} \text{ years}}{1 \text{ My}} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ = \frac{4.0 \times 10^{6}}{100 \times 1000} \frac{\text{km}}{\text{My}} = 40 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{My}} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The extremely small distance of 1.3 × 10⁻⁹ m per second illustrates why tectonic motion is imperceptible in everyday life—this is about one nanometer per second, roughly the size of a few atoms. However, over geological time scales of millions of years, this slow movement accumulates to 40 km per million years, which is significant enough to create mountains and move continents. This problem demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate time scales when describing processes that occur at vastly different rates.

**Strategy**

From Table 3, find the Earth-Sun distance. Calculate the circumference of Earth's orbit, divide by the time for one orbit (1 year), then convert to the requested units.

**Solution**

1. From Table 3, the distance from Earth to Sun is approximately $$ 10^{11} \m $$ (more precisely, about $$ 1.5 \times 10^{11} \m $$).

2. The circumference of Earth's orbit (assuming circular):
<div class="equation">
$$ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi(1.5 \times 10^{11} \m) = 9.42 \times 10^{11} \m $$
</div>

3. Time for one orbit is 1 year. From Table 3, one year = $$ 3.16 \times 10^{7} \s $$.

**(a) Speed in km/s:**

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{C}{t} = \frac{9.42 \times 10^{11} \m}{3.16 \times 10^{7} \s} = 2.98 \times 10^{4} \frac{\m}{\s} $$
</div>

Convert to km/s:

<div class="equation">
$$ v = 2.98 \times 10^{4} \frac{\m}{\s} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \m} = 29.8 \text{ km/s} \approx 30 \text{ km/s} $$
</div>

**(b) Speed in m/s:**

From above: $$ v = 2.98 \times 10^{4} \ms \approx 3.0 \times 10^{4} \ms $$

**Discussion**

Earth's orbital speed of approximately 30 km/s (or 30,000 m/s) is remarkably fast—about 108,000 km/h—yet we don't feel this motion because we're moving along with the Earth. This speed is much greater than the speed of sound (about 0.34 km/s) and represents the velocity needed to maintain a stable orbit around the Sun at Earth's distance. The calculation assumes a circular orbit, which is a good approximation since Earth's orbit is nearly circular with an eccentricity of only 0.017.

**Answer**

(a) The average speed of Earth in its orbit is approximately **30 km/s**.

(b) This is approximately **3.0 × 10⁴ m/s** (or 30,000 m/s).
