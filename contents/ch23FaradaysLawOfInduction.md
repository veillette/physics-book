### Faraday’s and Lenz’s Law

Faraday’s experiments showed that the emf **induced** by a change in magnetic flux
depends on only a few factors. First, _emf_ is directly proportional to the
change in flux $$\Delta \Phi $$ . Second, *emf* is greatest when the change in
time $$\Delta t $$ is smallest—that is, *emf* is inversely proportional to
$$\Delta t $$ . Finally, if a coil has $$N $$ turns, an emf will be produced
that is $$N $$ times greater than for a single coil, so that _emf_ is directly
proportional to $$N $$ . The equation for the emf induced by a change in
magnetic flux is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{emf}=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t}\text{.} $$
</div>

This relationship is known as **Faraday’s law of induction**. The units for emf
are volts, as is usual.

The minus sign in Faraday’s law of induction is very important. The minus means
that _the emf creates a current I and magnetic field B that oppose the change in
flux $$\Delta \Phi $$ —this is known as Lenz’s law_. The direction (given by the
minus sign) of the _emf_ is so important that it is called **Lenz’s law** after
the Russian Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865), who, like Faraday and Henry,independently
investigated aspects of induction. Faraday was aware of the direction, but Lenz
stated it so clearly that he is credited for its discovery. (
See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

![Part a of the figure shows a bar magnet held horizontal and moved into a coil held in the same plane. The magnet is moved in such a way that the north pole of the magnet is shown to face the coil. The magnetic lines of force are shown to emerge out from the North Pole. The magnetic field associated with the bar magnet is given as B mag. The strength of the magnetic field increases in the coil. The current induced in the coil I creates another field B coil, in the opposite direction of the bar magnet to oppose the increase. So B mag and B coil are in opposite directions. In part b of the diagram, the magnet is moved away from the coil. The magnet is moved in such a way that the north pole of the magnet is shown to face the coil. The magnetic lines of force are shown to emerge out from the North Pole. The magnetic field associated with the bar magnet is given as B mag. The current induced in the coil I creates another field B coil, in the same direction as the field of the bar magnet. So B mag and B coil are in same directions. Part c of the figure shows a bar magnet held horizontal and moved into a coil held in the same plane. The magnet is moved in such a way that the south pole of the magnet is shown to face the coil. The magnetic lines of force are shown to merge into the South Pole. The magnetic field associated with the bar magnet is given as B mag. The current induced in the coil I, creates another field B coil, in the opposite direction of field of the bar magnet. So B mag and B coil are in opposite directions.](../resources/Figure_23_02_01.jpg '(a) When this bar magnet is thrust into the coil, the strength of the magnetic field increases in the coil. The current induced in the coil creates another field, in the opposite direction of the bar magnet’s to oppose the increase. This is one aspect of Lenz’s law—induction opposes any change in flux. (b) and (c) are two other situations. Verify for yourself that the direction of the induced ( B_\\text{coil} ) shown indeed opposes the change in flux and that the current direction shown is consistent with RHR-2. ')

Problem-Solving Strategy for Lenz’s Law
</div>
To use Lenz’s law to determine the directions of the induced magnetic fields, currents, and emfs:

1. Make a sketch of the situation for use in visualizing and recording
   directions.
2. Determine the direction of the magnetic field B.
3. Determine whether the flux is increasing or decreasing.
4. Now determine the direction of the induced magnetic field B. It opposes
   the **change** in flux by adding or subtracting from the original field.
5. Use RHR-2 to determine the direction of the induced current I that is
   responsible for the induced magnetic field B.
6. The direction (or polarity) of the induced emf will now drive a current in
   this direction and can be represented as current emerging from the positive
   terminal of the emf and returning to its negative terminal.

For practice, apply these steps to the situations shown
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) and to others that are part of the following text
material.

### Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

There are many applications of Faraday’s Law of induction, as we will explore in
this chapter and others. At this juncture, let us mention several that have to
do with data storage and magnetic fields. A very important application has to do
with audio and video _recording tapes_. A plastic tape, coated with iron oxide,
moves past a recording head. This recording head is basically a round iron ring
about which is wrapped a coil of wire—an electromagnet ([[Figure 2]](#Figure2)).
A signal in the form of a varying input current from a microphone or camera goes
to the recording head. These signals (which are a function of the signal
amplitude and frequency) produce varying magnetic fields at the recording head.
As the tape moves past the recording head, the magnetic field orientations of
the iron oxide molecules on the tape are changed thus recording the signal. In
the playback mode, the magnetized tape is run past another head, similar in
structure to the recording head. The different magnetic field orientations of
the iron oxide molecules on the tape induces an emf in the coil of wire in the
playback head. This signal then is sent to a loudspeaker or video player.

![Photograph of the electronic components of playback heads used with audio and video magnetic tapes.](../resources/Figure_23_02_02.jpg 'Recording and playback heads used with audio and video magnetic tapes. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)')
{: #Figure2}

Similar principles apply to computer hard drives, except at a much faster rate.
Here recordings are on a coated, spinning disk. Read heads historically were
made to work on the principle of induction. However, the input information is
carried in digital rather than analog form – a series of 0’s or 1’s are written
upon the spinning hard drive. Today, most hard drive readout devices do not work
on the principle of induction, but use a technique known as _giant
magnetoresistance_. (The discovery that weak changes in a magnetic field in a
thin film of iron and chromium could bring about much larger changes in
electrical resistance was one of the first large successes of nanotechnology.)
Another application of induction is found on the magnetic stripe on the back of
your personal credit card as used at the grocery store or the ATM. This
works on the same principle as the audio or videotape mentioned in the last
paragraph in which a head reads personal information from your card.

Another application of electromagnetic induction is when electrical signals need
to be transmitted across a barrier. Consider the _cochlear implant_ shown below.
Sound is picked up by a microphone on the outside of the skull and is used to
set up a varying magnetic field. A current is induced in a receiver secured in
the bone beneath the skin and transmitted to electrodes in the inner ear.
Electromagnetic induction can be used in other instances where electric signals
need to be conveyed across various media.

![Photograph of a baby with a device attached on its lower part of the head, just above the right ear.](../resources/Figure_23_02_03.jpg 'Electromagnetic induction used in transmitting electric currents across mediums. The device on the baby’s head induces an electrical current in a receiver secured in the bone beneath the skin. (credit: Bjorn Knetsch)')
{: #Figure3}

Another contemporary area of research in which electromagnetic induction is
being successfully implemented (and with substantial potential) is transcranial
magnetic simulation. A host of disorders, including depression and
hallucinations can be traced to irregular localized electrical activity in the
brain. In _transcranial magnetic stimulation_, a rapidly varying and very
localized magnetic field is placed close to certain sites identified in the
brain. Weak electric currents are induced in the identified sites and can result
in recovery of electrical functioning in the brain tissue.

_Sleep apnea_ (“the cessation of breath”) affects both adults and infants (
especially premature babies and it may be a cause of sudden infant deaths
\[SID\]). In such individuals, breath can stop repeatedly during their sleep. A
cessation of more than 20 seconds can be very dangerous. Stroke, heart failure,
and tiredness are just some of the possible consequences for a person having
sleep apnea. The concern in infants is the stopping of breath for these longer
times. One type of monitor to alert parents when a child is not breathing uses
electromagnetic induction. A wire wrapped around the infant’s chest has an
alternating current running through it. The expansion and contraction of the
infant’s chest as the infant breathes changes the area through the coil. A
pickup coil located nearby has an alternating current induced in it due to the
changing magnetic field of the initial wire. If the child stops breathing, there
will be a change in the induced current, and so a parent can be alerted.

Making Connections: Conservation of Energy
</div>
Lenz’s law is a manifestation of the conservation of energy. The induced emf produces a current that opposes the change in flux, because a change in flux means a change in energy. Energy can enter or leave, but not instantaneously. Lenz’s law is a consequence. As the change begins, the law says induction opposes and, thus, slows the change. In fact, if the induced emf were in the same direction as the change in flux, there would be a positive feedback that would give us free energy from no apparent source—conservation of energy would be violated.

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Emf: How Great Is the Induced Emf?
</div>
Calculate the magnitude of the induced emf when the magnet in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)(a) is thrust into the coil, given the following information: the single loop coil has a radius of 6.00 cm and the average value of  $$B \cos \theta  $$
 (this is given, since the bar magnet’s field is complex) increases from 0.0500 T to 0.250 T in 0.100 s.

**Strategy**

To find the **magnitude** of emf, we use Faraday’s law of induction as stated by
$$\text{emf}=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t} $$ , but without the minus sign
that indicates direction:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{emf}=N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Solution**

We are given that $$N=1 $$ and $$\Delta t= 0.100 \text{s} $$ , but we must
determine the change in flux $$\Delta \Phi $$ before we can find emf. Since the
area of the loop is fixed, we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta \Phi =\Delta \left(BA \cos \theta \right)=A\Delta \left(B \cos \theta \right). $$
</div>
Now  $$\Delta \left(B \cos \theta \right)=0.200 \text{T} $$ ,
 since it was given that  $$B \cos \theta  $$
 changes from 0.0500 to 0.250 T. The area of the loop is  $$A=\pi r^2=\left( 3.14\text{...}\right){\left(0.060 \text{m}\right)}^{2}= 1.13 \times 10^{-2}  {\text{m}}^{2} $$ .
 Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta \Phi =\left( 1.13 \times 10^{-2} {\text{m}}^{2}\right)\left(0.200 \text{T}\right). $$
</div>
Entering the determined values into the expression for emf gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Emf}=N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t}=\frac{\left( 1.13 \times 10^{-2}  {\text{m}}^{2}\right)\left( 0.200 \text{T}\right)}{ 0.100 \text{s}}= 22.6 \text{mV} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

While this is an easily measured voltage, it is certainly not large enough for
most practical applications. More loops in the coil, a stronger magnet, and
faster movement make induction the practical source of voltages that it is.

### Section Summary

- Faraday’s law of induction states that the emf\*\*induced by a change in
  magnetic flux is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\text{emf}=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t} $$
  </div>

when flux changes by $$\Delta \Phi $$ in a time $$\Delta t $$ .

- If emf is induced in a coil, $$N $$ is its number of turns.
- The minus sign means that the emf \**creates a current $$I $$ and magnetic
  field $$B $$ that *oppose the change in flux\*
  $$\Delta \Phi $$ —this opposition is known as Lenz’s law.

{: #Figure4}

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We follow the problem-solving strategy for Lenz's Law: First, identify the direction of the magnetic field from coil 1. Then determine whether the flux through coil 2 is increasing or decreasing. Next, find the direction of the induced field in coil 2 that opposes this change. Finally, use RHR-2 to determine the induced current direction.

**Solution for (a): Current in coil 1 increases**

Following the steps:

1. Sketch: Coil 1 has current I flowing counterclockwise (as shown in Figure 4a)
2. By RHR-2, the magnetic field from coil 1 points out of the page through coil 2
3. If current in coil 1 increases, the magnetic flux through coil 2 increases (field pointing out increases)
4. The induced magnetic field in coil 2 must oppose this increase by pointing into the page
5. By RHR-2, a clockwise current in coil 2 produces a field into the page

**Answer for (a):** The induced current in coil 2 is clockwise (CW).

**Solution for (b): Current in coil 1 decreases**

Following the steps:

1. The magnetic field from coil 1 still points out of the page
2. If current in coil 1 decreases, the flux through coil 2 decreases
3. The induced field in coil 2 must oppose this decrease by pointing out of the page (same direction as original field)
4. By RHR-2, a counterclockwise current in coil 2 produces a field out of the page

**Answer for (b):** The induced current in coil 2 is counterclockwise (CCW).

**Solution for (c): Current in coil 1 is constant**

Following the steps:

1. If current is constant, the magnetic field from coil 1 is constant
2. The magnetic flux through coil 2 is not changing ($$\Delta\Phi = 0$$)
3. By Faraday's law: $$\text{emf} = -N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = 0$$
4. No emf means no induced current

**Answer for (c):** No current is induced in coil 2.

**Discussion**

This problem demonstrates the key principle of electromagnetic induction: only a *changing* magnetic flux induces an emf. A steady magnetic field, no matter how strong, produces no induced current. Lenz's law ensures that the induced current always opposes the change that produces it, which is a manifestation of energy conservation.

**Final Answer**

(a) Clockwise (CW); (b) Counterclockwise (CCW); (c) No current induced.

Referring to [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b), what is the direction of the current induced in the coil: (a) If the current in the wire increases? (b) If the current in the wire decreases? (c) If the current in the wire suddenly changes direction?
Explicitly show how you follow the steps in the [Problem-Solving Strategy for Lenz's Law](#Note1).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We follow the problem-solving strategy for Lenz's law: identify the direction of the magnetic field from the wire, determine whether flux through the coil is increasing or decreasing, find the direction of the induced field that opposes this change, and use RHR-2 to find the induced current direction.

**Solution for (a)**

Following the steps:

1. The wire is vertical with current flowing upward
2. By RHR-2, the magnetic field from the wire circles the wire counterclockwise when viewed from above
3. If current increases, flux through the horizontal coil increases (field points up through coil)
4. The induced field must oppose this increase by pointing downward through the coil
5. By RHR-2, a clockwise current (viewed from above) produces a downward field

**Answer:** The induced current is clockwise when viewed from above.

**Solution for (b)**

If current decreases:

1. Flux through the coil decreases
2. The induced field must oppose this decrease by pointing upward through the coil (same direction as original field)
3. By RHR-2, a counterclockwise current (viewed from above) produces an upward field

**Answer:** The induced current is counterclockwise when viewed from above.

**Solution for (c)**

If current suddenly reverses:

1. The magnetic field reverses direction
2. This is equivalent to the original field decreasing to zero and a new field in the opposite direction increasing
3. Initially, the induced current will be counterclockwise (to oppose decrease of original field)
4. Then clockwise (to oppose increase of reversed field)

**Answer:** The induced current initially flows counterclockwise, then clockwise when viewed from above.

**Discussion**

In all cases, Lenz's law ensures the induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the change in flux, consistent with energy conservation.

**Final Answer**

(a) Clockwise; (b) Counterclockwise; (c) First counterclockwise, then clockwise (when viewed from above).

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Referring to [[Figure 5]](#Figure5), what are the directions of the currents in coils 1, 2, and 3 (assume that the coils are lying in the plane of the circuit): (a) When the switch is first closed? (b) When the switch has been closed for a long time? (c) Just after the switch is opened?

![The figure shows a closed circuit consisting of a main coil with many loops connected to a cell through a switch. Three single loop coils named one, two and three are also shown. Coil one is on left of the main coil, coil two on the right and coil three on top of the main coil.](../resources/Figure_23_02_05.jpg ' ')
{: #Figure5}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We apply Lenz's law to each coil. When the switch closes, current begins flowing in the main coil, creating a magnetic field. When the switch has been closed for a long time, the current and field are constant. When the switch opens, the current and field decrease to zero. Each nearby coil (1, 2, and 3) experiences a change in magnetic flux, inducing currents that oppose these changes.

**Solution for (a): When the switch is first closed**

When the switch closes, current starts flowing through the main coil (clockwise as viewed from above based on battery polarity). This creates a magnetic field.

For **Coil 1** (to the left of main coil):
- Flux through coil 1 is increasing (field pointing right through it)
- Induced field must oppose this increase by pointing left
- By RHR-2, a counterclockwise current (viewed from the main coil) creates a field pointing left
- **Coil 1: CCW**

For **Coil 2** (to the right of main coil):
- Flux through coil 2 is increasing (field pointing left through it)
- Induced field must oppose this increase by pointing right
- By RHR-2, a counterclockwise current (viewed from the main coil) creates a field pointing right
- **Coil 2: CCW**

For **Coil 3** (above main coil):
- Flux through coil 3 is increasing (field pointing up through it from the loops of the main coil)
- Induced field must oppose this increase by pointing down
- By RHR-2, a clockwise current (viewed from above) creates a field pointing down
- **Coil 3: CW**

**Solution for (b): When the switch has been closed for a long time**

After a long time, the current in the main coil is constant (steady state).
- The magnetic field is constant
- No change in flux: $$\Delta\Phi = 0$$
- By Faraday's law: $$\text{emf} = -N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = 0$$
- **All coils (1, 2, and 3): No current induced**

**Solution for (c): Just after the switch is opened**

When the switch opens, current in the main coil drops to zero rapidly. The magnetic field decreases.

For **Coil 1**:
- Flux through coil 1 is decreasing (field pointing right is decreasing)
- Induced field must oppose this decrease by pointing right (same direction as original)
- By RHR-2, a clockwise current creates a field pointing right
- **Coil 1: CW**

For **Coil 2**:
- Flux through coil 2 is decreasing (field pointing left is decreasing)
- Induced field must oppose this decrease by pointing left (same direction as original)
- By RHR-2, a clockwise current creates a field pointing left
- **Coil 2: CW**

For **Coil 3**:
- Flux through coil 3 is decreasing (field pointing up is decreasing)
- Induced field must oppose this decrease by pointing up (same direction as original)
- By RHR-2, a counterclockwise current (viewed from above) creates a field pointing up
- **Coil 3: CCW**

**Discussion**

Notice that when the field is increasing (switch closes), the induced currents create fields that oppose the increase. When the field is decreasing (switch opens), the induced currents create fields that oppose the decrease—trying to maintain the original field. This is Lenz's law in action: induced effects always oppose the change causing them. This is consistent with energy conservation—if induced currents aided the change, we would have a runaway positive feedback system.

**Final Answer**

(a) Coil 1: CCW, Coil 2: CCW, Coil 3: CW; (b) All coils: no current induced; (c) Coil 1: CW, Coil 2: CW, Coil 3: CCW.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

With the battery reversed, currents in all three coils from the previous problem will be in opposite directions.

From the previous problem with normal battery orientation:
- (a) Coil 1: CCW, Coil 2: CCW, Coil 3: CW (when switch closes)
- (b) No currents when switch remains closed
- (c) Coil 1: CW, Coil 2: CW, Coil 3: CCW (when switch opens)

With battery reversed, all currents reverse:

**(a) When switch is first closed:**
- Coil 1: CW
- Coil 2: CW
- Coil 3: CCW

**(b) When switch has been closed for a long time:**
- Coil 1: No current
- Coil 2: No current
- Coil 3: No current

**(c) Just after switch is opened:**
- Coil 1: CCW
- Coil 2: CCW
- Coil 3: CW

**Discussion**

Reversing the battery reverses the magnetic field direction in the main coil, which reverses all induced currents by Lenz's law.

**Final Answer**

(a) Coil 1: CW, Coil 2: CW, Coil 3: CCW; (b) All no current; (c) Coil 1: CCW, Coil 2: CCW, Coil 3: CW.

Verify that the units of  $$\Delta \Phi  $$
/  $$\Delta t $$
 are volts. That is, show that  $$1 \text{T}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/\text{s}=1 \text{V} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We express tesla in fundamental units and show the equivalence to volts.

**Solution**

Starting with the magnetic flux units:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{\text{T} \cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}}$$
</div>

The tesla is defined as:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{T} = \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{V} \cdot \text{s}}{\text{m}^2}$$
</div>

Alternatively, from the magnetic force on a moving charge:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{T} = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{m}}$$
</div>

Substituting into the flux rate:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\text{T} \cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}} = \frac{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{A} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}} = \frac{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{s}}$$
</div>

Since work/energy is force times distance:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{s}} = \frac{\text{J}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{s}} = \frac{\text{J}}{\text{C}} = \text{V}$$
</div>

Therefore: $$1 \text{ T} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s} = 1 \text{ V}$$

**Discussion**

This confirms that Faraday's law correctly gives emf in volts when magnetic flux (in T·m²) changes over time (in seconds).

**Final Answer**

Verified: $$1 \text{ T} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s} = 1 \text{ V}$$.

The change in flux is:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\Phi = \Phi_{\text{final}} - \Phi_{\text{initial}} = B(0) - B(0.250) = -1.50 \text{ T}(0.250 \text{ m}^2) = -0.375 \text{ Wb}$$
</div>

The magnitude of induced emf is:

<div class="equation">
$$|\text{emf}| = N\left|\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}\right| = 50\left|\frac{-0.375 \text{ Wb}}{0.100 \text{ s}}\right| = 50(3.75) = 188 \text{ V}$$
</div>

For direction: The flux into the page is decreasing. By Lenz's law, the induced current must create a field into the page to oppose this decrease. By RHR-2, a clockwise current (viewed from above) creates a field into the page.

**Discussion**

The relatively large emf results from the rapid change in area combined with the 50-turn coil. This principle is used in various sensors and measuring devices.

**Final Answer**

The induced emf is 188 V, and the induced current flows clockwise when viewed from the front of the page.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) An MRI technician moves his hand from a region of very low magnetic field strength into an MRI scanner’s 2.00 T field with his fingers pointing in the direction of the field. Find the average emf induced in his wedding ring, given its diameter is 2.20 cm and assuming it takes 0.250 s to move it into the field. (b) Discuss whether this current would significantly change the temperature of the ring.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The ring moves from near-zero field into a 2.00 T field. The magnetic flux through the ring changes from approximately zero to $$\Phi = BA$$, where $$A$$ is the ring's area. We use Faraday's law $$\text{emf} = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$ to find the induced emf. For part (b), we estimate the current using Ohm's law and calculate the heating using $$Q = I^2 R t$$.

**Solution for (a)**

The ring's radius is:

<div class="equation">
$$r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{0.0220 \text{ m}}{2} = 0.0110 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The ring's area is:

<div class="equation">
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.0110)^2 = 3.80 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

The change in magnetic flux is:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\Phi = B_{\text{final}}A - B_{\text{initial}}A = (2.00)(3.80 \times 10^{-4}) - 0 = 7.60 \times 10^{-4} \text{ Wb}$$
</div>

The magnitude of induced emf is:

<div class="equation">
$$|\text{emf}| = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{7.60 \times 10^{-4}}{0.250} = 3.04 \times 10^{-3} \text{ V} = 3.04 \text{ mV}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

To estimate heating, we need to know the ring's resistance. For a gold wedding ring, a reasonable lower estimate is $$R = 1.00 \text{ m}\Omega = 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \Omega$$.

The induced current during the 0.250 s interval is:

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{\text{emf}}{R} = \frac{3.04 \times 10^{-3}}{1.00 \times 10^{-3}} = 3.04 \text{ A}$$
</div>

The energy dissipated as heat is:

<div class="equation">
$$Q = I^2 R t = (3.04)^2(1.00 \times 10^{-3})(0.250) = 2.31 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} = 2.31 \text{ mJ}$$
</div>

This is a very small amount of energy. To put it in perspective, the specific heat of gold is about 129 J/(kg·°C). For a typical 5-gram ring:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc} = \frac{2.31 \times 10^{-3}}{(0.005)(129)} \approx 0.0036 \text{ °C}$$
</div>

This temperature rise is negligible and would not be noticeable.

**Discussion**

While the induced emf is measurable (3.04 mV), the actual heating effect is negligible due to the ring's low resistance and the brief duration. However, MRI technicians are still advised to remove all metal jewelry because:
1. Faster movements or stronger field gradients could induce larger currents
2. The ring could experience mechanical forces in the strong magnetic field
3. The ring could distort the MRI images
4. In some cases with thin rings or people with poor circulation, even small heating could be uncomfortable

**Final Answer**

(a) The average induced emf is 3.04 mV. (b) The heat transferred would be approximately 2.31 mJ, causing a negligible temperature rise of about 0.004 °C. This is not a significant amount of heat and would not be noticed by the wearer.

**Integrated Concepts**

Referring to the situation in the previous problem: (a) What current is induced
in the ring if its resistance is 0.0100 $$\Omega $$ ?
(b) What average power is dissipated? (c) What magnetic field is induced at the
center of the ring? (d) What is the direction of the induced magnetic field
relative to the MRI's field?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From the previous problem, the induced emf is 3.04 mV. We use Ohm's law to find current, $$P = I^2R$$ for power, and the equation for magnetic field at the center of a circular loop: $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2r}$$.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
$$I = \frac{\text{emf}}{R} = \frac{3.04 \times 10^{-3} \text{ V}}{0.0100 \Omega} = 0.304 \text{ A}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

<div class="equation">
$$P = I^2 R = (0.304)^2(0.0100) = 9.24 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W} = 0.924 \text{ mW}$$
</div>

Alternatively: $$P = \frac{\text{emf}^2}{R} = \frac{(3.04 \times 10^{-3})^2}{0.0100} = 9.24 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W}$$

**Solution for (c)**

The radius is $$r = d/2 = 0.0220/2 = 0.0110 \text{ m}$$:

<div class="equation">
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2r} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7})(0.304)}{2(0.0110)} = 1.74 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T} = 17.4 \text{ μT}$$
</div>

**Solution for (d)**

By Lenz's law, the induced field opposes the change. Since the MRI field (into which the hand moves) is increasing through the ring, the induced field points opposite to the MRI field.

**Discussion**

The small power dissipation (less than 1 mW) explains why the ring doesn't heat significantly. The induced field is much weaker than the 2.00 T MRI field, about 10,000 times smaller.

**Final Answer**

(a) 0.304 A; (b) 0.924 mW; (c) 17.4 μT; (d) opposite to the MRI field direction.

An emf is induced by rotating a 1000-turn, 20.0 cm diameter coil in the Earth's  $$ 5.00 \times 10^{-5}  \text{T} $$
 magnetic field. What average emf is induced, given the plane of the coil is originally perpendicular to the Earth's field and is rotated to be parallel to the field in 10.0 ms?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When the coil plane is perpendicular to the Earth's field, maximum flux passes through it: $$\Phi_i = BA\cos(0°) = BA$$. When rotated to be parallel to the field, no flux passes through: $$\Phi_f = BA\cos(90°) = 0$$. We use Faraday's law $$\text{emf} = N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$ to find the average induced emf.

**Solution**

The coil radius is:

<div class="equation">
$$r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{0.200 \text{ m}}{2} = 0.100 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The coil area is:

<div class="equation">
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.100)^2 = 0.0314 \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

The initial flux (perpendicular orientation):

<div class="equation">
$$\Phi_i = BA = (5.00 \times 10^{-5})(0.0314) = 1.57 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Wb}$$
</div>

The final flux (parallel orientation):

<div class="equation">
$$\Phi_f = 0$$
</div>

The change in flux:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\Phi = \Phi_f - \Phi_i = 0 - 1.57 \times 10^{-6} = -1.57 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Wb}$$
</div>

The magnitude of average induced emf:

<div class="equation">
$$|\text{emf}| = N\frac{|\Delta\Phi|}{\Delta t} = 1000 \times \frac{1.57 \times 10^{-6}}{10.0 \times 10^{-3}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$|\text{emf}| = 1000 \times 1.57 \times 10^{-4} = 0.157 \text{ V}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Despite the Earth's weak magnetic field (only 50 μT), a measurable emf of 157 mV is produced due to the large number of turns (1000) in the coil. This demonstrates the principle behind generators: even weak magnetic fields can produce useful voltages when combined with multiple coil turns and rapid rotation. The rapid 10 ms rotation time (equivalent to 100 rotations per second) also contributes significantly to the induced emf.

**Final Answer**

The average induced emf is 0.157 V (or 157 mV).

A 0.250 m radius, 500-turn coil is rotated one-fourth of a revolution in 4.17 ms, originally having its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. (This is 60 rev/s.) Find the magnetic field strength needed to induce an average emf of 10 000 V.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When rotated one-fourth revolution from perpendicular to parallel, $$\Delta(BA\cos\theta) = BA$$ (changes from BA to 0). We use $$\text{emf} = N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = N\frac{BA}{\Delta t}$$ and solve for $$B$$.

**Solution**

The area of the coil is:

<div class="equation">
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.250)^2 = 0.196 \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

From Faraday's law:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{emf} = N\frac{BA}{\Delta t}$$
</div>

Solving for $$B$$:

<div class="equation">
$$B = \frac{\text{emf} \cdot \Delta t}{NA}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$B = \frac{(10000 \text{ V})(4.17 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s})}{(500)(0.196 \text{ m}^2)} = \frac{41.7}{98.0} = 0.425 \text{ T}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This field strength is achievable with strong permanent magnets or electromagnets, making this a practical generator design. The high emf results from the combination of many turns and rapid rotation.

**Final Answer**

The required magnetic field strength is 0.425 T.

Approximately how does the emf induced in the loop in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b)
depend on the distance of the center of the loop from the wire?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The magnetic field from a long straight wire is $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$, where $$r$$ is the distance from the wire. For a small loop at distance $$r$$, the flux is approximately $$\Phi \approx BA$$, where $$A$$ is the loop area. When the current changes, the induced emf depends on how the flux changes: $$\text{emf} = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$.

**Solution**

The magnetic field from the wire at distance $$r$$ is:

<div class="equation">
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$
</div>

For a loop of area $$A$$ positioned at distance $$r$$ from the wire (assuming the loop is small compared to $$r$$):

<div class="equation">
$$\Phi \approx BA = \frac{\mu_0 I A}{2\pi r}$$
</div>

When the current changes by $$\Delta I$$ in time $$\Delta t$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\Phi = \frac{\mu_0 A \Delta I}{2\pi r}$$
</div>

The induced emf is:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{emf} = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{\mu_0 A}{2\pi r} \cdot \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}$$
</div>

Since $$\mu_0$$, $$A$$, and $$\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}$$ are constants (or specified parameters), we can write:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{emf} \propto \frac{1}{r}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The induced emf is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire. This makes physical sense because:
1. The magnetic field from the wire decreases as $$1/r$$
2. The flux through the loop therefore also decreases as $$1/r$$
3. The rate of change of flux (which determines emf) follows the same $$1/r$$ dependence

This means that if you double the distance from the wire, the induced emf is halved. If you move 10 times farther away, the induced emf becomes 1/10 of its original value. This inverse relationship is characteristic of fields produced by long straight wires and is important for understanding electromagnetic induction in practical situations like power lines and electrical circuits.

**Final Answer**

The induced emf is approximately proportional to $$\frac{1}{r}$$, where $$r$$ is the distance from the center of the loop to the wire.

(a) A lightning bolt produces a rapidly varying magnetic field. If the bolt

will induce a voltage in a loop aligned like that in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b).
What voltage is induced in a 1.00 m diameter loop 50.0 m from a $$ 2.00 \times 10^{6} \text{A} $$ lightning strike, if the current falls to zero in $$25.0 \mu
\text{s} $$ ?
(b) Discuss circumstances under which such a voltage would produce noticeable
consequences.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The magnetic field from a long straight wire is $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$. The flux through a horizontal loop of area $$A$$ is approximately $$\Phi \approx BA$$. The induced emf is $$\text{emf} = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$.

**Solution for (a)**

The magnetic field at distance $$r = 50.0 \text{ m}$$ from the lightning bolt:

<div class="equation">
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7})(2.00 \times 10^6)}{2\pi(50.0)} = \frac{8.00 \times 10^{-1}}{100\pi} = 2.55 \times 10^{-3} \text{ T}$$
</div>

The loop area is:

<div class="equation">
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi(0.500)^2 = 0.785 \text{ m}^2$$
</div>

The change in flux as current drops to zero:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\Phi = BA = (2.55 \times 10^{-3})(0.785) = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ Wb}$$
</div>

The induced emf:

<div class="equation">
$$\text{emf} = \frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{2.00 \times 10^{-3}}{25.0 \times 10^{-6}} = 80.0 \text{ V}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

This 80 V induced emf could produce noticeable consequences in several situations:
- If the loop is part of electrical wiring in a building, it could damage sensitive electronic equipment
- It could cause currents large enough to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
- In underground metal pipes or cables, it could cause sparking or heating
- For a person forming a conducting loop (e.g., touching two metal objects), it could deliver a dangerous shock
- The voltage is sufficient to break down small air gaps, causing arcing

**Discussion**

This demonstrates why lightning strikes can damage electrical systems even at considerable distances. Proper grounding and surge protection are essential.

**Final Answer**

(a) The induced voltage is 80.0 V. (b) This voltage could damage electronics, trip breakers, cause dangerous shocks, or create arcing in nearby conductors.
