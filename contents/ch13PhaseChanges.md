Up to now, we have considered the behavior of ideal gases. Real gases are like
ideal gases at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, however, the
interactions between the molecules and their volumes cannot be ignored. The
molecules are very close (condensation occurs) and there is a dramatic decrease
in volume, as seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The substance changes from a gas
to a liquid. When a liquid is cooled to even lower temperatures, it becomes a
solid. The volume never reaches zero because of the finite volume of the
molecules.

![Line graph of volume versus temperature showing the relationship for an ideal gas and a real gas. The line for an ideal gas is linear starting at absolute zero showing a linear increase in volume with temperature. The line for a real gas is linear above a temperature of negative one hundred ninety degrees Celsius and follows that of the ideal gas. But below that temperature, the graph shows an almost vertical drop in volume with temperature as the temperature drops and the gas condenses.](../resources/Figure_13_05_01.jpg 'A sketch of volume versus temperature for a real gas at constant pressure. The linear (straight line) part of the graph represents ideal gas behavior—volume and temperature are directly and positively related and the line extrapolates to zero volume at ( -273.15 \\text{ºC} ), or absolute zero. When the gas becomes a liquid, however, the volume actually decreases precipitously at the liquefaction point. The volume decreases slightly once the substance is solid, but it never becomes zero.')
{: #Figure1}

High pressure may also cause a gas to change phase to a liquid. Carbon dioxide,
for example, is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, but becomes
a liquid under sufficiently high pressure. If the pressure is reduced, the
temperature drops and the liquid carbon dioxide solidifies into a snow-like
substance at the temperature $$-78\text{ºC} $$ . Solid $${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ is
called “dry ice.” Another example of a gas that can be in a liquid phase is
liquid nitrogen $$\left({\text{LN}}_{2}\right) $$ . $${\text{LN}}_{2} $$ is made
by liquefaction of atmospheric air (through compression and cooling). It boils
at 77 K $$\left(-196\text{ºC}\right) $$ at atmospheric pressure. $${\text{LN}}_ {2} $$ is useful as a refrigerant and allows for the preservation of blood,
sperm, and other biological materials. It is also used to reduce noise in
electronic sensors and equipment, and to help cool down their current-carrying
wires. In dermatology, $${\text{LN}}_{2} $$ is used to freeze and painlessly
remove warts and other growths from the skin.

### _PV_ Diagrams

We can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a graph of
pressure versus volume, called a ** PV diagram**. When the substance behaves
like an ideal gas, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its
pressure and volume. That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $$ PV= Nk_{B}T \left(\text{ideal gas}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>

Now, assuming the number of molecules and the temperature are fixed,

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=\text{constant} \left(\text{ideal gas, constant temperature}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>

For example, the volume of the gas will decrease as the pressure increases. If
you plot the relationship $$PV=\text{constant} $$ on a $$PV $$ diagram, you find
a hyperbola. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a graph of pressure versus volume. The
hyperbolas represent ideal-gas behavior at various fixed temperatures, and are
called _isotherms_. At lower temperatures, the curves begin to look less like
hyperbolas—the gas is not behaving ideally and may even contain liquid. There is
a **critical point**—that is, a **critical temperature**—above which liquid
cannot exist. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas
will have the density of a liquid but will not condense. Carbon dioxide, for
example, cannot be liquefied at a temperature above $$ 31.0\text{ºC} $$ .
**Critical pressure** is the minimum pressure needed for liquid to exist at the
critical temperature. [[Table 1]](#Table1) lists representative critical
temperatures and pressures.

![Graphs of pressure versus volume at six different temperatures, T one through T five and T critical. T one is the lowest temperature and T five is the highest. T critical is in the middle. Graphs show that pressure per unit volume is greater for greater temperatures. Pressure decreases with increasing volume for all temperatures, except at low temperatures when pressure is constant with increasing volume during a phase change.](../resources/Figure_13_05_04.jpg '( PV ) diagrams.

The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the ( PV ) diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.

### Phase Diagrams

The plots of pressure versus temperatures provide considerable insight into
thermal properties of substances. There are well-defined regions on these graphs
that correspond to various phases of matter, so $$\text{PT} $$ graphs are
called **phase diagrams**. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows the phase diagram for
water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature you can
determine the phase of water. The solid lines—boundaries between phases—indicate
temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist (that is, they exist
together in ratios, depending on pressure and temperature). For example, the
boiling point of water is $$100\text{ºC} $$ at 1.00 atm. As the pressure
increases, the boiling temperature rises steadily to $$374\text{ºC} $$ at a
pressure of 218 atm. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) will cook food
faster because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than
$$100\text{ºC} $$ without all boiling away. The curve ends at a point called
the _critical point_, because at higher temperatures the liquid phase does not
exist at any pressure. The critical point occurs at the critical temperature, as
you can see for water from [[Table 1]](#Table1). The critical temperature for
oxygen is $$-118\text{ºC} $$ , so oxygen cannot be liquefied above this
temperature.

![Graph of pressure versus temperature showing the boundaries of the three phases of water, along with the triple point and critical point. The triple point, where all three phases exist, is at 0 point 006 atmospheres and 0 point 01 degrees C. The critical point is at two hundred eighteen atmospheres and three hundred seventy four degrees C. Solid water is in the P T region generally to the left (lower temperature, lower or higher pressure, from the triple point). Liquid water is generally above and to the right of the triple point (higher pressure, higher temperature). The region of water vapor is to the lower right of the triple point (lower pressure and temperature to higher temperature and pressure).](../resources/Figure_13_05_05.jpg 'The phase diagram (( PT ) graph) for water. Note that the axes are nonlinear and the graph is not to scale. This graph is simplified—there are several other exotic phases of ice at higher pressures.')
{: #Figure3}

Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) gives the melting temperature at various pressures.
For example, the melting point is $$0\text{ºC} $$ at 1.00 atm, as expected. Note
that, at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid (ice) to
liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. Ice melts from pressure in the hands
of a snowball maker. From the phase diagram, we can also say that the melting
temperature of ice rises with increased pressure. When a car is driven over
snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards the
water refreezes and forms an ice layer.

At sufficiently low pressures there is no liquid phase, but the substance can
exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures
below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called **sublimation**.
It accounts for large losses of snow pack that never make it into a river, the
routine automatic defrosting of a freezer, and the freeze-drying process applied
to many foods. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sublimates at standard
atmospheric pressure of 1 atm. (The solid form of $${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ is known
as dry ice because it does not melt. Instead, it moves directly from the solid
to the gas state.)

All three curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point, the **triple
point**, where all three phases exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple
point occurs at 273.16 K $$\left( 0.01\text{ºC}\right) $$ , and is a more
accurate calibration temperature than the melting point of water at 1.00 atm, or
273.15 K $$\left( 0.0\text{ºC}\right) $$ . See [[Table 2]](#Table2) for the
triple point values of other substances.

### Equilibrium

Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).) If a substance is in a closed container at the
boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same
rate without net change in their relative amount. Molecules in the liquid escape
as a gas at the same rate at which gas molecules stick to the liquid, or form
droplets and become part of the liquid phase. The combination of temperature and
pressure has to be “just right”; if the temperature and pressure are increased,
equilibrium is maintained by the same increase of boiling and condensation
rates.

![Figure a shows a closed system containing a liquid and a gas. A thermometer with one end in the liquid indicates an unspecified temperature, and a pressure gauge indicates an unspecified pressure. A vector from the liquid to the gas represents the rate of vaporization, and a vector from the gas into the liquid represents the rate of condensation. The two vectors are equal in length, illustrating that the two rates are equal. Figure b is essentially the same as figure a, except that the pressure, temperature, and rates of condensation and vaporization are all greater than in figure a. The rates of vaporization and condensation in figure b are equal to each other, even though they are greater than the rates in figure a.](../resources/Figure_13_05_06.jpg 'Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher temperature, the boiling rate is faster and the rates at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas are also faster. Because there are more molecules in the gas, the gas pressure is higher and the rate at which gas molecules condense and enter the liquid is faster. As a result the gas and liquid are in equilibrium at this higher temperature.')

One example of equilibrium between liquid and gas is that of water and steam at
$$100\text{ºC} $$ and 1.00 atm. This temperature is the boiling point at that
pressure, so they should exist in equilibrium. Why does an open pot of water at
$$100\text{ºC} $$ boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not
pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water and steam are in a closed
container at $$100\text{ºC} $$ and 1.00 atm, they would coexist—but with air
over the pot, there are fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils. What
about water at $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ and 1.00 atm? This temperature and pressure
correspond to the liquid region, yet an open glass of water at this temperature
will completely evaporate. Again, the gas around it is air and not pure water
vapor, so that the reduced evaporation rate is greater than the condensation
rate of water from dry air. If the glass is sealed, then the liquid phase
remains. We call the gas phase a **vapor** when it exists, as it does for water
at $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ , at a temperature below the boiling temperature.

### Vapor Pressure, Partial Pressure, and Dalton’s Law

**Vapor pressure** is defined as the pressure at which a gas coexists with its
solid or liquid phase. Vapor pressure is created by faster molecules that break
away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase. The vapor pressure of a
substance depends on both the substance and its temperature—an increase in
temperature increases the vapor pressure.

**Partial pressure** is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it
occupied the total volume available. In a mixture of gases, _the total pressure
is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases_, assuming ideal gas
behavior and no chemical reactions between the components. This law is known
as **Dalton’s law of partial pressures**, after the English scientist John
Dalton (1766–1844), who proposed it. Dalton’s law is based on kinetic theory,
where each gas creates its pressure by molecular collisions, independent of
other gases present. It is consistent with the fact that pressures add according
to [Pascal’s Principle](../contents/ch11PascalsPrinciple). Thus water evaporates and ice
sublimates when their vapor pressures exceed the partial pressure of water vapor
in the surrounding mixture of gases. If their vapor pressures are less than the
partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding gas, liquid droplets or ice
crystals (frost) form.

Is energy transfer involved in a phase change? If so, will energy have to be supplied to change phase from solid to liquid and liquid to gas? What about gas to liquid and liquid to solid? Why do they spray the orange trees with water in Florida when the temperatures are near or just below freezing?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
Yes, energy transfer is involved in a phase change. We know that atoms and molecules in solids and liquids are bound to each other because we know that force is required to separate them. So in a phase change from solid to liquid and liquid to gas, a force must be exerted, perhaps by collision, to separate atoms and molecules. Force exerted through a distance is work, and energy is needed to do work to go from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. This is intuitively consistent with the need for energy to melt ice or boil water. The converse is also true. Going from gas to liquid or liquid to solid involves atoms and molecules pushing together, doing work and releasing energy.

### Section Summary

- Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid.
- Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and
  pressure.
- The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can
  be described in a phase diagram.
- Two phases coexist (i.e., they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of
  pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram.
- The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known
  as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram.
- A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor.
- Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or
  liquid phase.
- Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone.
- Dalton’s law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial
  pressures of all of the gases present.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A pressure cooker contains water and steam in equilibrium at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. How does this greater pressure increase cooking speed?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the relationship between pressure and boiling point, and how temperature affects cooking.

**Solution:**
Greater pressure increases the boiling point of water. At atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water boils at 100ºC. In a pressure cooker operating at higher pressure (typically 2 atm), water doesn't boil until it reaches approximately 120ºC.

This higher temperature significantly increases cooking speed because chemical reactions (including those that cook food) proceed faster at higher temperatures. The rate of most chemical reactions roughly doubles for every 10ºC increase in temperature. Therefore, cooking at 120ºC instead of 100ºC can reduce cooking time by half or more.

**Discussion:**
The pressure cooker takes advantage of the phase diagram for water—moving along the liquid-gas boundary to higher pressures allows liquid water to exist at higher temperatures. This is particularly useful for cooking foods that normally require long cooking times, such as tough cuts of meat, dried beans, or root vegetables. The elevated temperature breaks down proteins and softens fibers much faster than boiling at atmospheric pressure.

Condensation forms most rapidly on the coldest object because that object's surface temperature is most likely to be at or below the dew point of the surrounding air. The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor (100% relative humidity).

When warm, humid air comes into contact with a cold surface (like a glass of ice water), the air immediately adjacent to the surface cools down. As this air cools, its capacity to hold water vapor decreases. If the surface temperature is below the dew point, the water vapor in the air adjacent to the surface becomes supersaturated and must condense into liquid droplets on the surface.

The colder the object, the lower its surface temperature, and the more likely it is to be below the dew point. Additionally, a colder surface creates a larger temperature gradient, which can cool more of the adjacent air below the dew point, resulting in more rapid condensation.

**Discussion:**
This is why glasses of cold drinks "sweat" on humid days, why bathroom mirrors fog up during hot showers, and why dew forms on grass during cool nights. The coldest surfaces act as condensation nuclei, extracting water vapor from the air and converting it to liquid.

What is the vapor pressure of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at  $$ - 78.5\text{ºC} $$ ?

![The phase diagram (pressure versus temperature graph showing the three phases) for carbon dioxide. The triple point is five point one one atmospheres and negative fifty-six point six degrees Celsius. The critical point is seventy-three atmospheres and thirty-one degrees C.

{: #Figure5}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the phase diagram for carbon dioxide. At −78.5ºC, find where the solid-gas boundary intersects this temperature.

**Solution:**
From Figure 5, at −78.5ºC, the phase diagram shows that solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimes directly to gas at standard atmospheric pressure of **1.0 atmosphere** (or approximately $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa).

This means the vapor pressure of solid CO₂ at −78.5ºC is exactly 1.0 atm. At this temperature and pressure, solid and gas phases coexist in equilibrium on the solid-gas boundary line.

**Discussion:**
This is why dry ice sublimes (converts directly from solid to gas) at atmospheric pressure and this temperature, rather than melting. The triple point of CO₂ is at 5.11 atm and −56.6ºC, which is above atmospheric pressure. This means at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), there is no liquid phase—CO₂ exists only as solid below −78.5ºC and as gas above this temperature. This property makes dry ice useful for cooling without creating liquid mess, as it goes directly from solid to gas.

Can carbon dioxide be liquefied at room temperature ( $$20\text{ºC} $$)? If so, how? If not, why not? (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Examine the phase diagram for CO₂ and determine if liquid phase exists at 20ºC. Compare this temperature to the critical temperature.

**Solution:**
Yes, carbon dioxide can be liquefied at room temperature (20ºC), but only by applying sufficient pressure. From Figure 5, the critical temperature of CO₂ is 31ºC. Since room temperature (20ºC) is below the critical temperature, a liquid phase can exist.

To liquefy CO₂ at 20ºC, you would need to increase the pressure significantly. Following the 20ºC vertical line on the phase diagram upward, you would need to apply a pressure of approximately 56-57 atmospheres (about $$ 5.7 \times 10^{6} $$ Pa) to reach the liquid phase region.

**Discussion:**
This is exactly how CO₂ fire extinguishers work—they store liquid CO₂ at room temperature under high pressure (typically around 60 atm). When released, the pressure drops to atmospheric, and the liquid CO₂ rapidly converts to gas and solid (the white "snow" you see), which helps suppress fires. If the temperature were above 31ºC (the critical temperature), no amount of pressure could liquefy the CO₂—it would exist only as a supercritical fluid.

Oxygen cannot be liquefied at room temperature by placing it under a large enough pressure to force its molecules together. Explain why this is.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the concept of critical temperature and what it means for phase transitions.

**Solution:**
Oxygen cannot be liquefied at room temperature because room temperature (about 20-25ºC or 293-298 K) is well above oxygen's critical temperature of −118.4ºC (154.8 K).

The critical temperature is the temperature above which a substance cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of how much pressure is applied. Above the critical temperature, the thermal kinetic energy of the molecules is so high that no amount of pressure can force them to remain close enough together in the orderly arrangement characteristic of a liquid. Instead, above the critical temperature and critical pressure, the substance exists as a supercritical fluid—a state that has properties intermediate between liquid and gas.

**Discussion:**
This is why oxygen must be cooled below 154.8 K (−118.4ºC) before it can be liquefied, even under high pressure. Liquid oxygen (LOX) used in rockets and medical applications must be stored at cryogenic temperatures well below its critical temperature. The same principle applies to other gases with low critical temperatures, such as nitrogen (−146.9ºC) and helium (−267.9ºC), which all require significant cooling before they can be liquefied.

What is the distinction between gas and vapor?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the relationship between the gas phase and the boiling temperature of a substance.

**Solution:**
The distinction between gas and vapor relates to temperature relative to the boiling point:

- A **vapor** is a gas that exists at a temperature **below** its boiling point (at the given pressure). A vapor can be condensed to a liquid simply by increasing the pressure at constant temperature, without cooling.

- A **gas** is used more generally, and often refers to a substance that exists at a temperature **above** its boiling point (at the given pressure). A gas cannot be liquefied merely by increasing pressure at that temperature—it must be cooled below its boiling point first.

For example, at 20ºC and atmospheric pressure:
- Water exists as a vapor (since 20ºC < 100ºC, water's boiling point)
- Nitrogen exists as a gas (since 20ºC >> −196ºC, nitrogen's boiling point)

**Discussion:**
This distinction is useful because vapors are relatively close to their liquid phase and can be liquefied more easily than gases. In everyday usage, "gas" is often used generically to refer to any substance in the gaseous state, but technically "vapor" is more precise when discussing a substance below its boiling point. The phase diagram helps clarify this: a vapor exists in the region where a small increase in pressure or decrease in temperature would cause condensation to liquid.
