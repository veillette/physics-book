</div>

The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the **Doppler effect**. The high-pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch
roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer. The closer the
motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle
moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in
frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. It is so familiar that
it is used to imply motion and children often mimic it in play.

The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to
motion of either the source or the observer. Although less familiar, this effect
is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For example, if
you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s
frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. The actual change in frequency
due to relative motion of source and observer is called a **Doppler shift**. The
Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and
mathematician Christian Johann Doppler (1803–1853), who did experiments with
both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example, had musicians
play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks
as a train passed by. Their music was observed both on and off the train, and
changes in frequency were measured.

What causes the Doppler shift? [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), [[Figure 2]](#Figure2),
and [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) compare sound waves emitted by stationary and moving
sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from
the point where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of
the spheres representing the air compressions in the sound wave centered on the
same point, and the stationary observers on either side see the same wavelength
and frequency as emitted by the source, as in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). If the
source is moving, as in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), then the situation is different.
Each compression of the air moves out in a sphere from the point where it was
emitted, but the point of emission moves. This moving emission point causes the
air compressions to be closer together on one side and farther apart on the
other. Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on
the right in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)), and longer in the opposite direction (on
the left in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). Finally, if the observers move, as
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), the frequency at which they receive the compressions
changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher
frequency, and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower
frequency.

![Sound waves coming out of a car stopped on a road are shown as spherical areas of compression. The waves are shown to reach two observers, X and Y, standing on opposite sides of the car.](../resources/Figure_17_04_02.jpg 'Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.')
{: #Figure1}

![Two observers X and Y are standing at two ends of a road. A car is shown to move from observer X on the left toward observer Y on the right. The sound waves are shown as spherical air compressions spreading out from points from which they are emitted marked from one through five. The air compressions are shown to arrive more frequently for the observer Y toward whom the car moves, compared to the compressions reaching X.](../resources/Figure_17_04_03.jpg 'Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.')
{: #Figure2}

![A car is shown stopped on a road. Two observers are shown crossing the road from behind the car. The observer X on the left is moving away from the car, and observer Y on the right is approaching the car. The sound waves coming from a point in the car are shown as spherical air compressions that reach the observers at different frequencies.](../resources/Figure_17_04_04.jpg 'The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.')
{: #Figure3}

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by $${v}_{w}=f\lambda $$ ,
where $${v}_{w} $$ is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and
has the same speed $${v}_{w} $$ in that medium whether the source is moving or
not. Thus $$f $$ multiplied by $$\lambda $$ is a constant. Because the observer
on the right in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) receives a shorter wavelength, the
frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left
receives a longer wavelength, and hence he hears a lower frequency. The same
thing happens in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). A higher frequency is received by the
observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is received by an
observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of
source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency.
Relative motion apart decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed is,
the greater the effect.

<div class="title">
The Doppler Effect
</div>
The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source. There are Doppler shifts in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for example. Doppler shifts can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a medical diagnostic. The recession of galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from them and has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by observations of Doppler shifts.

</div>

For a stationary observer and a moving source, the frequency _f_<sub>obs</sub>
received by the observer can be shown to be

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right), $$
</div>

where $${f}_{s} $$ is the frequency of the source, $${v}_{s} $$ is the speed of
the source along a line joining the source and observer, and $${v}_{w} $$ is the
speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the
plus sign for motion away from the observer, producing the appropriate shifts up
and down in frequency. Note that the greater the speed of the source, the
greater the effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the
frequency received by the observer $${f}_{\text{obs}} $$ is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}}\right), $$
</div>

where $${v}_{\text{obs}} $$ is the speed of the observer along a line joining
the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the source, and
the minus is for motion away from the source.

Calculate Doppler Shift: A Train Horn
</div>
Suppose a train that has a 150-Hz horn is moving at 35.0 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/s.

(a) What frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the
tracks as the train approaches and after it passes?

(b) What frequency is observed by the train’s engineer traveling on the train?

**Strategy**

To find the observed frequency in (a), $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{
{v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right), $$ must be used because the source is moving.
The minus sign is used for the approaching train, and the plus sign for the
receding train. In (b), there are two Doppler shifts—one for a moving source and
the other for a moving observer.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Enter known values into $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{
{v}_{w} - {v}_{s}}\right). $$

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(\frac{340 \text{m/s}}{340 \text{m/s} - 35.0 \text{m/s}}\right) $$
</div>
(2) Calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train approaches.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{obs}=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(1.11\right)=167 \text{Hz} $$
</div>
(3) Use the same equation with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train recedes.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(\frac{340 \text{m/s}}{340 \text{m/s}+35.0 \text{m/s}}\right) $$
</div>
(4) Calculate the second frequency.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{obs}=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(0.907\right)=136 \text{Hz} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (a)**

The numbers calculated are valid when the train is far enough away that the
motion is nearly along the line joining train and observer. In both cases, the
shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is 17.0 Hz for
motion toward and 14.0 Hz for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric.

**Solution for (b)**

(1) Identify knowns:

- It seems reasonable that the engineer would receive the same frequency as
  emitted by the horn, because the relative velocity between them is zero.
- Relative to the medium (air), the speeds are $${v}_{s}={v}_{\text{obs}}=35.0
  m/s. $$
- The first Doppler shift is for the moving observer; the second is for the
  moving source.

(2) Use the following equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left[{f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}}\right)\right]\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right). $$
</div>
The quantity in the square brackets is the Doppler-shifted frequency due to a moving observer. The factor on the right is the effect of the moving source.

(3) Because the train engineer is moving in the direction toward the horn, we
must use the plus sign for $${v}_{obs}; $$ however, because the horn is also
moving in the direction away from the engineer, we also use the plus sign for
$${v}_{s} $$ . But the train is carrying both the engineer and the horn at the
same velocity, so $${v}_{s}={v}_{obs} $$ . As a result, everything but $${f}_{s}

$$
cancels, yielding

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}. $$
</div>
**Discussion for (b)**

We may expect that there is no change in frequency when source and observer move
together because it fits your experience. For example, there is no Doppler shift
in the frequency of conversations between driver and passenger on a motorcycle.
People talking when a wind moves the air between them also observe no Doppler
shift in their conversation. The crucial point is that source and observer are
not moving relative to each other.

### Sonic Booms to Bow Wakes

What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane,
that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? The answer to this question
applies not only to sound but to all other waves as well.

Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of
frequency $${f}_{s} $$ . The greater the plane’s speed $${v}_{s} $$ , the
greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value observed for $${f}_
{\text{obs}} $$ . Now, as $${v}_{s} $$ approaches the speed of sound, $${f}_
{\text{obs}} $$ approaches infinity, because the denominator in $${f}_
{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w} ± {v}_{s}}\right)
$$

approaches zero. At the speed of sound, this result means that in front of the
source, each successive wave is superimposed on the previous one because the
source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the
same instant, and so the frequency is infinite. (Before airplanes exceeded the
speed of sound, some people argued it would be impossible because such
constructive superposition would produce pressures great enough to destroy the
airplane.) If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the
observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the approaching
source are mixed with those from it when receding. This mixing appears messy,
but something interesting happens—a sonic boom is created. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).)

![The diagram shows a sound wave with spherical air compressions emerging from a source moving toward the right. The source is shown to move with a velocity v sub s. The spherical air compressions are shown to move with velocity v sub w. The interference of sound waves is shown along two lines, one on each side of the waves. The angle between these two lines is labeled theta.](../resources/Figure_17_04_05.jpg 'Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the point where they are emitted, but the source moves ahead of each. Constructive interference along the lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions) creates a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed of the source, the smaller the angle ( \\theta ).')
{: #Figure4}

There is constructive interference along the lines shown (a cone in three
dimensions) from similar sound waves arriving there simultaneously. This
superposition forms a disturbance called a **sonic boom**, a constructive
interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the
cone, the interference is mostly destructive, and so the sound intensity there
is much less than on the shock wave. An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one
from its nose and one from its tail. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) During
television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be
heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to
pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating
the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as
seen in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude,
pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as
rattle nerves. Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights
are banned over populated areas of the United States.

![An airplane is shown to fly above three observers on the ground. There are two conical shock waves or sonic booms created by the nose and tail of the aircraft. The observer on the left is shown to receive the conical shock wave from the tail of the aircraft, the observer in the middle receives the conical shock wave from the nose of the aircraft, and the observer on the right has not heard any sound, she is just wondering what is happening.](../resources/Figure_17_04_06.jpg 'Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.')
{: #Figure5}

Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A **bow
wake**, such as the one in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6), is created when the wave
source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in
circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped
wake trailing the source. A more exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic
particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light travels in that
medium. In a vacuum, the maximum speed of light will be $$c= 3.00 \times 10^{8}
\text{m/s} $$ ; in the medium of water, the speed of light is closer to $$0.75c

$$
. If the particle creates light in its passage, that light spreads on a cone
with an angle indicative of the speed of the particle, as illustrated
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). Such a bow wake is called Cerenkov radiation and is
commonly observed in particle physics.

![Photograph of a black duck swimming in water. The path left behind by the duck in water shows a near cone shape.](../resources/Figure_17_04_07.jpg "Bow wake created by a duck. Constructive interference produces the rather structured wake, while there is relatively little wave action inside the wake, where interference is mostly destructive. (credit: Horia Varlan, Flickr)")

{: #Figure7}

Doppler shifts and sonic booms are interesting sound phenomena that occur in all
types of waves. They can be of considerable use. For example, the Doppler shift
in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, while police use the
Doppler shift in radar (a microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology,
the Doppler shift is used to track the motion of storm clouds; such “Doppler
Radar” can give velocity and direction and rain or snow potential of imposing
weather fronts. In astronomy, we can examine the light emitted from distant
galaxies and determine their speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away from
us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer
wavelength—the so-called red shift. Such information from galaxies far, far away
has allowed us to estimate the age of the universe (from the Big Bang) as about
14 billion years.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Is the Doppler shift real or just a sensory illusion?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
The Doppler shift is a **real physical phenomenon**, not a sensory illusion. The frequency of the sound waves arriving at the observer is physically different from the frequency emitted by the source. The relative motion between the source and observer causes the wavefronts to be compressed (higher frequency) or stretched (lower frequency). This change in frequency can be measured by instruments, so it is not just a product of our perception. For example, police radar guns use the Doppler shift of radio waves to measure the speed of vehicles.

Due to efficiency considerations related to its bow wake, the supersonic transport aircraft must maintain a cruising speed that is a constant ratio to the speed of sound (a constant Mach number). If the aircraft flies from warm air into colder air, should it increase or decrease its speed? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
The aircraft should **decrease** its speed.

The speed of sound is lower in colder air. To maintain a constant Mach number (which is the ratio of the aircraft's speed to the speed of sound), the aircraft must decrease its speed proportionally as the speed of sound decreases.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
When you hear a sonic boom, you often cannot see the plane that made it. Why is that?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
This is because the airplane is traveling faster than the speed of sound, while the sonic boom (the shock wave) travels at the speed of sound. By the time the shock wave reaches an observer on the ground, the airplane that created it has already traveled a significant distance ahead of the boom.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What frequency is received by a person watching an oncoming ambulance moving at 110 km/h and emitting a steady 800-Hz sound from its siren? The speed of sound on this day is 345 m/s. (b) What frequency does she receive after the ambulance has passed?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This problem involves a moving source (ambulance) and a stationary observer. We must use the formula for a moving source: $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right)$$. For part (a), the ambulance is approaching, so we use the minus sign in the denominator. For part (b), the ambulance is receding, so we use the plus sign. First, we must convert the ambulance speed from km/h to m/s to match the units of the speed of sound.

**Solution**

Part (a): First, convert the ambulance speed to m/s:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{s}=110 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \text{ s}}=30.56 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

For the approaching ambulance, use the Doppler shift formula with the minus sign:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{345 \text{ m/s}-30.56 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{314.44 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(1.0971\right)=878 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

Part (b): For the receding ambulance, use the plus sign:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{345 \text{ m/s}+30.56 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{375.56 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(0.9186\right)=735 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The approaching ambulance produces a frequency shift of +78 Hz (about 9.8% higher), while the receding ambulance produces a shift of -65 Hz (about 8.1% lower). These shifts are quite noticeable to the human ear, which is why emergency vehicles sound distinctly different when approaching versus receding. Note that the shifts are asymmetric—the increase when approaching is larger than the decrease when receding, even though the speed is the same. This asymmetry arises from the mathematical form of the Doppler equation. The observer hears a frequency of 878 Hz when the ambulance approaches, which is significantly higher than the emitted 800 Hz, and 735 Hz when it recedes. This dramatic change helps pedestrians and drivers identify the location and motion of emergency vehicles.

(a) At an air show a jet flies directly toward the stands at a speed of 1200 km/h, emitting a frequency of 3500 Hz, on a day when the speed of sound is 342 m/s. What frequency is received by the observers? (b) What frequency do they receive as the plane flies directly away from them?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This is a moving source (jet) with stationary observers problem. We use the formula $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right)$$, with the minus sign for approach and plus sign for recession. First, we must convert the jet speed from km/h to m/s. An important feature of this problem is that the jet is traveling at nearly the speed of sound, which will produce a dramatic Doppler shift.

**Solution**

First, convert the jet speed to m/s:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{s}=1200 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \text{ s}}=333.3 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Note that this is very close to the speed of sound (342 m/s), so the jet is traveling at approximately Mach 0.97.

Part (a): For the approaching jet, use the minus sign:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{342 \text{ m/s}}{342 \text{ m/s}-333.3 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{342 \text{ m/s}}{8.7 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(39.3\right)=1.38 \times 10^{5} \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

Part (b): For the receding jet, use the plus sign:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{342 \text{ m/s}}{342 \text{ m/s}+333.3 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{342 \text{ m/s}}{675.3 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(0.506\right)=1.77 \times 10^{3} \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The results are dramatic! When approaching, the frequency shifts from 3500 Hz to 138,000 Hz—an increase by a factor of about 39. This enormous shift occurs because the jet is traveling at nearly the speed of sound, making the denominator $${v}_{w}-{v}_{s}$$ very small. This is why the Doppler formula predicts an infinite frequency when the source travels exactly at the speed of sound (the denominator becomes zero). When receding, the frequency drops to 1770 Hz, about half the emitted frequency. The massive asymmetry between approach and recession frequencies is characteristic of sources moving at near-sonic speeds. In reality, much of this shifted sound would be outside the range of human hearing (20-20,000 Hz), but the jet's engine produces a wide spectrum of frequencies, so observers would still hear an intense, high-pitched sound on approach and a much lower rumble as it recedes.

**Strategy**

This problem involves a moving source (the hawk) approaching a stationary observer (the mouse).

Since the hawk is approaching the mouse, we use the minus sign in the denominator, which increases the observed frequency.

**Solution**

The hawk is moving toward the mouse, so we apply the formula with the minus sign:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{331 \text{ m/s}}{331 \text{ m/s}-25.0 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{331 \text{ m/s}}{306 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(3500 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(1.082\right)=3790 \text{ Hz}=3.79 \times 10^{3} \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The mouse perceives a frequency about 8.2% higher than the hawk actually emits. This frequency shift of 290 Hz is readily audible and represents a shift of about 4 musical semitones. From an evolutionary perspective, many prey animals have developed acute hearing to detect approaching predators through such Doppler shifts—the rising pitch of a predator's call provides crucial information about whether the predator is approaching. The relatively modest speed of the hawk (25.0 m/s, or about 90 km/h) compared to the speed of sound (331 m/s) means the Doppler shift is noticeable but not extreme. The perceived frequency of 3790 Hz is well within the hearing range of most small mammals, which typically extends to much higher frequencies than human hearing.

A spectator at a parade receives an 888-Hz tone from an oncoming trumpeter who is playing an 880-Hz note. At what speed is the musician approaching if the speed of sound is 338 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This problem involves a moving source (trumpeter) and a stationary observer (spectator). We know the source frequency $${f}_{s}=880$$ Hz, the observed frequency $${f}_{\text{obs}}=888$$ Hz, and the speed of sound $${v}_{w}=338$$ m/s. We need to find the source speed $${v}_{s}$$. Since the musician is approaching, we use the Doppler formula $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)$$ and solve for $${v}_{s}$$.

**Solution**

Start with the Doppler shift formula for an approaching source:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right) $$
</div>

Substitute the known values:

<div class="equation" >
 $$888 \text{ Hz}=\left(880 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{338 \text{ m/s}}{338 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}}\right) $$
</div>

Divide both sides by 880 Hz:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{888}{880}=\frac{338 \text{ m/s}}{338 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00909=\frac{338 \text{ m/s}}{338 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}} $$
</div>

Cross-multiply:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00909\left(338 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}\right)=338 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$341.07 \text{ m/s}-1.00909{v}_{s}=338 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Solve for $${v}_{s}$$:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00909{v}_{s}=341.07 \text{ m/s}-338 \text{ m/s}=3.07 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{s}=\frac{3.07 \text{ m/s}}{1.00909}=3.04 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The trumpeter is moving at approximately 3.0 m/s (about 11 km/h or 7 mph), which is a reasonable walking/marching speed for a parade. The frequency shift is only 8 Hz (about 0.9%), which is quite small but still noticeable to a trained ear—musicians can typically detect pitch differences of about 0.5% or less. This small shift corresponds to the modest speed of the source relative to the speed of sound. The calculation demonstrates an important application of the Doppler effect: if we can measure the frequency shift, we can determine the speed of the source. This principle is used in radar guns (for measuring vehicle speeds), Doppler weather radar (for measuring wind speeds), and medical ultrasound (for measuring blood flow velocity).

A commuter train blows its 200-Hz horn as it approaches a crossing. The speed of sound is 335 m/s. (a) An observer waiting at the crossing receives a frequency of 208 Hz. What is the speed of the train? (b) What frequency does the observer receive as the train moves away?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Part (a) requires finding the source velocity from the observed Doppler shift. We know $${f}_{s}=200$$ Hz, $${f}_{\text{obs}}=208$$ Hz (approaching), and $${v}_{w}=335$$ m/s. We use the approaching source formula and solve for $${v}_{s}$$. For part (b), we use the same source speed but apply the receding source formula to find the new observed frequency.

**Solution**

Part (a): Start with the Doppler formula for an approaching source:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right) $$
</div>

Substitute known values:

<div class="equation" >
 $$208 \text{ Hz}=\left(200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{335 \text{ m/s}}{335 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}}\right) $$
</div>

Divide by 200 Hz:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.04=\frac{335 \text{ m/s}}{335 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}} $$
</div>

Cross-multiply and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.04\left(335 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}\right)=335 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$348.4 \text{ m/s}-1.04{v}_{s}=335 \text{ m/s} $$

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.04{v}_{s}=13.4 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{s}=12.9 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Part (b): Now use the receding source formula with $${v}_{s}=12.9$$ m/s:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{335 \text{ m/s}}{335 \text{ m/s}+12.9 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{335 \text{ m/s}}{347.9 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(0.963\right)=193 \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The train is traveling at 12.9 m/s (about 46 km/h or 29 mph), which is a reasonable speed for a commuter train approaching a crossing—trains typically slow down near crossings for safety. The frequency increases by 8 Hz (4%) when approaching and decreases by 7 Hz (3.5%) when receding. The asymmetry in the shifts (+8 Hz vs. -7 Hz) is characteristic of the Doppler effect. A person waiting at the crossing would clearly hear the pitch drop from 208 Hz to 193 Hz as the train passes—a change of 15 Hz. This distinctive pitch change is one of the most familiar examples of the Doppler effect in everyday life. The calculation in part (a) demonstrates an inverse Doppler problem, where we work backward from the observed frequency shift to determine the source speed—this is exactly how police radar guns work, though they use electromagnetic waves instead of sound.

Can you perceive the shift in frequency produced when you pull a tuning fork toward you at 10.0 m/s on a day when the speed of sound is 344 m/s? To answer this question, calculate the factor by which the frequency shifts and see if it is greater than 0.300%.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

When you pull a tuning fork toward yourself, you create relative motion between the source and observer. We can analyze this as a moving source approaching a stationary observer (considering the sound waves emitted by the fork). We use the formula $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)$$ to find the shift factor, then calculate the percentage change. If this percentage exceeds 0.300%, the shift is perceptible.

**Solution**

For a source moving toward the observer at $${v}_{s}=10.0$$ m/s:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)={f}_{s}\left(\frac{344 \text{ m/s}}{344 \text{ m/s}-10.0 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{344 \text{ m/s}}{334 \text{ m/s}}\right)={f}_{s}\left(1.0299\right) $$
</div>

The shift factor is 1.0299, meaning the observed frequency is 1.0299 times the source frequency.

Calculate the percentage shift:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Percentage shift}=\left(1.0299-1\right) \times 100\%=0.0299 \times 100\%=2.99\% $$
</div>

Since 2.99% >> 0.300%, yes, you can perceive the shift.

**Discussion**

The frequency shift of approximately 3.0% is about ten times larger than the 0.300% threshold for perceptibility, so it would be clearly audible. To put this in musical terms, a 3% shift corresponds to about half a semitone (one semitone is about 6%), which musicians can easily detect. This demonstrates that even relatively modest speeds (10 m/s is about 36 km/h or 22 mph) can produce noticeable Doppler shifts when the motion is along the line connecting source and observer. The 0.300% threshold mentioned in the problem represents the approximate limit of human pitch discrimination—most people can detect frequency differences of about 0.3% to 0.5%, while trained musicians can often detect even smaller differences. This problem illustrates why you can hear pitch changes when waving a sound source (like a buzzer or whistle) back and forth, and why the Doppler effect is so prominent in everyday experience with moving sound sources.

Two eagles fly directly toward one another, the first at 15.0 m/s and the second at 20.0 m/s. Both screech, the first one emitting a frequency of 3200 Hz and the second one emitting a frequency of 3800 Hz. What frequencies do they receive if the speed of sound is 330 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

This problem involves both a moving source and a moving observer, since both eagles are moving and both are emitting and receiving sound. We must use the general Doppler formula: $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}∓{v}_{s}}\right)$$. Since both eagles are flying toward each other, we use the plus sign for $${v}_{\text{obs}}$$ (observer moving toward source) and the minus sign for $${v}_{s}$$ (source moving toward observer). We need to calculate two separate frequencies: what the first eagle hears from the second, and what the second eagle hears from the first.

**Solution**

For the first eagle hearing the second eagle's screech:
- Observer (first eagle): $${v}_{\text{obs}}=15.0$$ m/s toward the source
- Source (second eagle): $${v}_{s}=20.0$$ m/s toward the observer, $${f}_{s}=3800$$ Hz

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(3800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{330 \text{ m/s}+15.0 \text{ m/s}}{330 \text{ m/s}-20.0 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(3800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{345 \text{ m/s}}{310 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(3800 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(1.113\right)=4230 \text{ Hz}=4.23 \times 10^{3} \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

For the second eagle hearing the first eagle's screech:
- Observer (second eagle): $${v}_{\text{obs}}=20.0$$ m/s toward the source
- Source (first eagle): $${v}_{s}=15.0$$ m/s toward the observer, $${f}_{s}=3200$$ Hz

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(3200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{330 \text{ m/s}+20.0 \text{ m/s}}{330 \text{ m/s}-15.0 \text{ m/s}}\right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left(3200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(\frac{350 \text{ m/s}}{315 \text{ m/s}}\right)=\left(3200 \text{ Hz}\right)\left(1.111\right)=3560 \text{ Hz}=3.56 \times 10^{3} \text{ Hz} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Both eagles hear significantly higher frequencies than what is being emitted because they are approaching each other. The first eagle hears a frequency 430 Hz higher (an 11.3% increase), while the second eagle hears a frequency 360 Hz higher (an 11.1% increase). These shifts are quite substantial and demonstrate that when both source and observer are moving toward each other, the Doppler shift is enhanced—the combined effect is greater than either motion alone would produce. This is why head-on collisions between vehicles with sirens produce the most dramatic pitch changes. The fact that the two shifts are similar (both around 11%) despite different speeds reflects the symmetry in their relative motion. In nature, such bidirectional Doppler shifts are important for predator-prey interactions and for communication between animals in flight. The general Doppler formula used here combines both effects multiplicatively: the observer's motion changes the rate at which wave crests are encountered, while the source's motion changes the spacing between crests.

What is the minimum speed at which a source must travel toward you for you to be able to hear that its frequency is Doppler shifted? That is, what speed produces a shift of 0.300% on a day when the speed of sound is 331 m/s?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to find the source speed that produces exactly a 0.300% frequency shift, which represents the threshold of human pitch perception. A 0.300% shift means the observed frequency is 1.00300 times the source frequency (or a shift factor of 1.003). We use the approaching source formula $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)$$ and solve for $${v}_{s}$$ when $${f}_{\text{obs}}/{f}_{s}=1.003$$.

**Solution**

A 0.300% increase means:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {f}_{\text{obs}}}{ {f}_{s}}=1+\frac{0.300}{100}=1.00300 $$
</div>

Using the Doppler formula for an approaching source:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {f}_{\text{obs}}}{ {f}_{s}}=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}} $$
</div>

Substitute the shift factor:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00300=\frac{331 \text{ m/s}}{331 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}} $$
</div>

Cross-multiply:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00300\left(331 \text{ m/s}-{v}_{s}\right)=331 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $$331.99 \text{ m/s}-1.00300{v}_{s}=331 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Solve for $${v}_{s}$$:

<div class="equation" >
 $$1.00300{v}_{s}=0.99 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{s}=\frac{0.99 \text{ m/s}}{1.00300}=0.99 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

Therefore, the minimum perceptible speed is approximately 1.0 m/s.

**Discussion**

The minimum speed of about 1.0 m/s (3.6 km/h or 2.2 mph) is quite slow—roughly a leisurely walking pace. This demonstrates that the human ear is remarkably sensitive to pitch changes. Even at this slow speed, a trained listener can detect the Doppler shift in the frequency of a sound source. This sensitivity explains why we can easily hear Doppler shifts in everyday situations: a person walking past you while talking on a phone, a cyclist ringing a bell as they pass, or a car driving slowly down a residential street. The 0.300% threshold represents the just-noticeable difference (JND) for pitch perception in most people—trained musicians can often detect even smaller differences, down to about 0.1% to 0.2%. This remarkable auditory acuity evolved as a survival mechanism, helping our ancestors detect the motion of both predators and prey. The calculation shows that perceptible Doppler shifts occur at speeds far below those typically associated with dramatic pitch changes (like emergency vehicles), making the Doppler effect a ubiquitous phenomenon in our acoustic environment.
