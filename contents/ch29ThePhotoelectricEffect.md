When light strikes materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called
the **photoelectric effect**, meaning that light (_photo_) produces electricity.
One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those
that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras. In a similar way,
another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have
seen on a roof top or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric
effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices.

![An image of a vacuum tube is shown.](../resources/Figure_29_02_01.jpg 'The photoelectric effect can be observed by allowing light to fall on the metal plate in this evacuated tube. Electrons ejected by the light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the collector wire and plate can then be adjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. For example, if it is sufficiently negative, no electrons will reach the wire. (credit: P.P. Urone)')

This effect has been known for more than a century and can be studied using a
device such as that shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). This figure shows an
evacuated tube with a metal plate and a collector wire that are connected by a
variable voltage source, with the collector more negative than the plate. When
light (or other EM radiation) strikes the plate in the evacuated tube, it may
eject electrons. If the electrons have energy in electron volts (eV) greater
than the potential difference between the plate and the wire in volts, some
electrons will be collected on the wire. Since the electron energy in eV is $$qV $$ , where $$q $$ is the electron charge and $$V $$ is the potential difference,
the electron energy can be measured by adjusting the retarding voltage between
the wire and the plate. The voltage that stops the electrons from reaching the
wire equals the energy in eV. For example, if $$-3.00 \text{V} $$ barely stops
the electrons, their energy is 3.00 eV. The number of electrons ejected can be
determined by measuring the current between the wire and plate. The more light,
the more electrons; a little circuitry allows this device to be used as a light
meter.

What is really important about the photoelectric effect is what Albert Einstein
deduced from it. Einstein realized that there were several characteristics of
the photoelectric effect that could be explained only if _EM radiation is itself
quantized_\: the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is
actually composed of energy quanta called photons. In his explanation of the
photoelectric effect, Einstein defined a quantized unit or quantum of EM energy,
which we now call a **photon**, with an energy proportional to the frequency of
EM radiation. In equation form, the **photon energy** is

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf, $$
</div>

where $$E $$ is the energy of a photon of frequency $$f $$ and $$h $$ is
Planck’s constant. This revolutionary idea looks similar to Planck’s
quantization of energy states in blackbody oscillators, but it is quite
different. It is the quantization of EM radiation itself. EM waves are composed
of photons and are not continuous smooth waves as described in previous chapters
on optics. Their energy is absorbed and emitted in lumps, not continuously. This
is exactly consistent with Planck’s quantization of energy levels in blackbody
oscillators, since these oscillators increase and decrease their energy in steps
of $$ hf $$ by absorbing and emitting photons having $$E= hf $$ . We do not
observe this with our eyes, because there are so many photons in common light
sources that individual photons go unnoticed. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) The
next section of the
text ([Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum](../contents/ch29PhotonEnergiesAndTheElectromagneticSpectrum)) is devoted to
a discussion of photons and some of their characteristics and implications. For
now, we will use the photon concept to explain the photoelectric effect, much as
Einstein did.

![Light rays coming out of a flashlight. The photons are depicted as small ellipses enclosing a wave each and moving in the direction of the rays. Energies of photons are labeled as E and E prime, where E is equal to h f and E prime is equal to h f prime.](../resources/Figure_29_02_02.jpg 'An EM wave of frequency ( f ) is composed of photons, or individual quanta of EM radiation. The energy of each photon is ( E=hf ), where ( h ) is Planck’s constant and ( f ) is the frequency of the EM radiation. Higher intensity means more photons per unit area. The flashlight emits large numbers of photons of many different frequencies, hence others have energy ( E{^\\prime}=hf{^\\prime} ), and so on. ')
{: #Figure2}

The photoelectric effect has the properties discussed below. All these
properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation
are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining
the photon’s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea
that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens
with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy $$ hf $$

.

1. If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a material, we find
   the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency $${f}_{0}

for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of
intensity. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the
photon energy is too small to break an electron away, no electrons will be
ejected. If EM radiation was a simple wave, sufficient energy could be
obtained by increasing the intensity. 2. _Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay_.
As soon as an individual photon of a sufficiently high frequency is absorbed
by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were
a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be
deposited to the metal surface to eject an electron. 3. The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the
intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity
EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all
photons having the same characteristic energy $$ hf $$ .

4. If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of
   ejected electrons, we find the following: _The maximum kinetic energy of
   ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation_. Since
   there are so many electrons in a material, it is extremely unlikely that two
   photons will interact with the same electron at the same time, thereby
   increasing the energy given it. Instead (as noted in 3 above), increased
   intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM
   radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could give more energy, and
   higher-energy electrons would be ejected.
5. The kinetic energy of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the
   binding energy of the electron in the specific material. An individual photon
   can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon’s energy is partly used
   to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the
   ejected electron’s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given by
   <div class="equation" >
   $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf-\text{BE}, $$
   </div>

   where $${\text{KE}}_{e} $$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected
   electron, $$ hf $$ is the photon’s energy, and BE is the **binding energy**
   of the electron to the particular material. (BE is sometimes called the *work function* of the material.) This equation, due to Einstein in 1905, explains
   the properties of the photoelectric effect quantitatively. An individual
   photon of EM radiation (it does not come any other way) interacts with an
   individual electron, supplying enough energy, BE, to break it away, with the
   remainder going to kinetic energy. The binding energy is $$\text{BE}=hf_{0} $$ , where $${f}_{0} $$ is the threshold frequency for the particular
   material. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a graph of maximum $${\text{KE}}\_{e} $$

   versus the frequency of incident EM radiation falling on a particular
   material.

![A graph of frequency verses kinetic energy of an electron is shown, where frequency is along x axis and kinetic energy is along the y axis. The plot is a straight line having an inclination with x axis and meets the x axis at f sub zero, known as threshold frequency, given by B E divided by h. The threshold kinetic energy is written as equal to h f minus B E.](../resources/Figure_29_02_03.jpg 'Photoelectric effect. A graph of the kinetic energy of an ejected electron, ( \\text{KE}_\\text{e} ), versus the frequency of EM radiation impinging on a certain material.

Above the threshold energy, ( \\text{KE}_\\text{e} ) increases linearly with ( f ) , consistent with ( \\text{KE}_\\text{e}=hf -\\text{BE} ). The slope of this line is ( h ) —the data can be used to determine Planck’s constant experimentally. Einstein gave the first successful explanation of such data by proposing the idea of photons—quanta of EM radiation.  ')
{: #Figure3}

Einstein’s idea that EM radiation is quantized was crucial to the beginnings of
quantum mechanics. It is a far more general concept than its explanation of the
photoelectric effect might imply. All EM radiation can also be modeled in the
form of photons, and the characteristics of EM radiation are entirely consistent
with this fact. (As we will see in the next section, many aspects of EM
radiation, such as the hazards of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, can be explained _
only_ by photon properties.) More famous for modern relativity, Einstein planted
an important seed for quantum mechanics in 1905, the same year he published his
first paper on special relativity. His explanation of the photoelectric effect
was the basis for the Nobel Prize awarded to him in 1921. Although his other
contributions to theoretical physics were also noted in that award, special and
general relativity were not fully recognized in spite of having been partially
verified by experiment by 1921. Although hero-worshipped, this great man never
received Nobel recognition for his most famous work—relativity.

Calculating Photon Energy and the Photoelectric Effect: A Violet Light
</div>
(a) What is the energy in joules and electron volts of a photon of 420-nm violet light? (b) What is the maximum kinetic energy of electrons ejected from calcium by 420-nm violet light, given that the binding energy (or work function) of electrons for calcium metal is 2.71 eV?

**Strategy**

To solve part (a), note that the energy of a photon is given by $$E= hf $$ . For
part (b), once the energy of the photon is calculated, it is a straightforward
application of $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE} $$ to find the ejected
electron’s maximum kinetic energy, since BE is given.

__Solution for (a)__

Photon energy is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf $$
</div>
Since we are given the wavelength rather than the frequency, we solve the familiar relationship  $$c=f\lambda  $$  for the frequency, yielding

<div class="equation" >
 $$f=\frac{c}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Combining these two equations gives the useful relationship

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Now substituting known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{\left( 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{J}\cdot \text{s}\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)}{420 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}}=4.74 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}. $$
</div>
Converting to eV, the energy of the photon is

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left( 4.74 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}\right)\frac{1 \text{eV}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}}=2.96 \text{eV}. $$
</div>
__Solution for (b)__

Finding the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is now a simple application
of the equation $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE} $$ . Substituting the photon
energy and binding energy yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE}=2.96 \text{eV} - 2.71 \text{eV}=0.246 \text{eV}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The energy of this 420-nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule,
and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense
directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking
at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy
to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of
energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order
of eV, so that the UV photon in this example could have biological effects. The
ejected electron (called a _photoelectron_) has a rather low energy, and it
would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a
retarding potential of but 0.26 eV. In fact, if the photon wavelength were
longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative
kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420-nm photons with
their 2.96-eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can show
for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 459 nm (blue light). This means
that if calcium metal is used in a light meter, the meter will be insensitive to
wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be
completely insensitive to red light, for example.

### Section Summary

- The photoelectric effect is the process in which EM radiation ejects electrons
  from a material.
- Einstein proposed photons to be quanta of EM radiation having energy $$E= hf $$ , where $$f $$ is the frequency of the radiation.
- All EM radiation is composed of photons. As Einstein explained, all
  characteristics of the photoelectric effect are due to the interaction of
  individual photons with individual electrons.
- The maximum kinetic energy $${\text{KE}}_{e} $$ of ejected electrons (
photoelectrons) is given by $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf\text{- BE} $$ , where $$ hf $$
  is the photon energy and BE is the binding energy (or work function) of the
  electron to the particular material.

What is the longest-wavelength EM radiation that can eject a photoelectron from silver, given that the binding energy is 4.73 eV? Is this in the visible range?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The longest wavelength corresponds to the minimum photon energy needed to eject an electron, which equals the binding energy. We use $$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$ with $$E = \text{BE}$$.

**Solution**

At the threshold for photoemission, the photon energy equals the binding energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{BE} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
</div>

Solving for wavelength:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{hc}{\text{BE}}$$
</div>

Using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{4.73 \text{ eV}} = 262 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This wavelength of 262 nm is in the ultraviolet range, well below the visible spectrum which extends from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 760 nm (red). Silver requires UV radiation for the photoelectric effect because its binding energy (4.73 eV) is higher than the photon energies of visible light (1.63-3.26 eV). Photons with wavelengths shorter than 262 nm (higher energy) can eject electrons from silver, while longer wavelengths cannot. This high binding energy makes silver less suitable for photoelectric devices that operate with visible light but useful for UV detection applications.

**Discussion**

This wavelength of 554 nm is in the visible range, specifically in the green-yellow part of the spectrum. Visible light ranges from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 760 nm (red), so this threshold wavelength is indeed visible. Photons with wavelengths shorter than 554 nm (higher energy) can eject electrons from potassium, while longer wavelengths cannot. This makes potassium useful in photoelectric devices sensitive to visible light.

What is the binding energy in eV of electrons in magnesium, if the longest-wavelength photon that can eject electrons is 337 nm?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The longest wavelength that can eject electrons corresponds to photons with energy equal to the binding energy. We use $$\text{BE} = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$.

**Solution**

The binding energy equals the photon energy at threshold:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{BE} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
</div>

Using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{BE} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{337 \text{ nm}} = 3.68 \text{ eV}$$

**Discussion**

Magnesium has a binding energy of 3.68 eV, which falls between that of potassium (2.24 eV) and silver (4.73 eV). The threshold wavelength of 337 nm is in the ultraviolet range, just below the visible spectrum. This means magnesium requires UV light to exhibit the photoelectric effect and will not respond to visible light. This binding energy reflects the strength with which electrons are held in magnesium's outer shell and is important for applications in UV photodetectors and understanding magnesium's chemical properties.

What is the maximum kinetic energy in eV of electrons ejected from sodium metal by 450-nm EM radiation, given that the binding energy is 2.28 eV?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the photoelectric equation $${\text{KE}}_e = hf - \text{BE}$$, where the photon energy is $$hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$. Calculate the photon energy first, then subtract the binding energy.

**Solution**

First, calculate the photon energy using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{450 \text{ nm}} = 2.76 \text{ eV}$$

Now apply the photoelectric equation:

<div class="equation">
 $${\text{KE}}_e = E_{\text{photon}} - \text{BE} = 2.76 \text{ eV} - 2.28 \text{ eV} = 0.48 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The 450-nm blue light photons have just barely enough energy (2.76 eV) to overcome sodium's binding energy (2.28 eV) and eject electrons with a small kinetic energy of 0.48 eV. This demonstrates that sodium is sensitive to visible light, making it useful for photoelectric applications. The small kinetic energy means these photoelectrons won't travel far and can be stopped by a retarding potential of only 0.48 V.

UV radiation having a wavelength of 120 nm falls on gold metal, to which electrons are bound by 4.82 eV. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons?

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the photoelectric equation $${\text{KE}}_e = hf - \text{BE}$$, where the photon energy is $$hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$. The maximum kinetic energy is the photon energy minus the binding energy.

**Solution**

First, calculate the photon energy using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{120 \text{ nm}} = 10.33 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Now apply the photoelectric equation:

<div class="equation">
 $${\text{KE}}_e = E_{\text{photon}} - \text{BE} = 10.33 \text{ eV} - 4.82 \text{ eV} = 5.51 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The UV photon has sufficient energy (10.33 eV) to overcome the binding energy of gold (4.82 eV) and still impart 5.51 eV of kinetic energy to the ejected electron. This is a relatively high kinetic energy for a photoelectron, more than twice the binding energy. Such energetic photoelectrons could travel significant distances in a vacuum before being stopped. Gold's relatively high binding energy makes it less suitable for visible-light photoelectric applications but useful for UV detection.

Violet light of wavelength 400 nm ejects electrons with a maximum kinetic energy of 0.860 eV from sodium metal. What is the binding energy of electrons to sodium metal?

**Strategy**

Use the photoelectric equation $${\text{KE}}_e = hf - \text{BE}$$ and solve for the binding energy. First calculate the photon energy, then use the given kinetic energy to find BE.

**Solution**

Calculate the photon energy using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{400 \text{ nm}} = 3.10 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Rearrange the photoelectric equation to solve for binding energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{BE} = E_{\text{photon}} - {\text{KE}}_e = 3.10 \text{ eV} - 0.860 \text{ eV} = 2.24 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This value of 2.24 eV matches the known work function of sodium within experimental uncertainty. The 400-nm violet photons carry 3.10 eV of energy, of which 2.24 eV is needed to overcome the binding and 0.860 eV goes into the electron's kinetic energy. This relatively low binding energy makes sodium highly sensitive to visible light, which is why sodium-based photocells are common in practical photoelectric devices. The measurement demonstrates how the photoelectric effect can be used to determine the work function of materials.

**Discussion**

Uranium metal has a binding energy of 3.63 eV for its outermost electrons. This value is intermediate between the alkali metals (around 2-2.3 eV) and more tightly bound metals like silver (4.73 eV). The 300-nm UV photon provides 4.13 eV of energy, which is sufficient to overcome the binding and give the electron 0.500 eV of kinetic energy.

The photon energy must equal the sum of binding energy and kinetic energy: $$E_{\text{photon}} = \text{BE} + {\text{KE}}_e$$. We then use $$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}}$$ to find the wavelength.

This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Discussion**

The 263-nm UV photons carry 4.71 eV of energy, with 2.71 eV used to overcome calcium's binding energy and 2.00 eV transferred to the electron as kinetic energy. This is well into the UV range (below 400 nm), meaning calcium requires UV radiation to produce photoelectrons with this much kinetic energy. Visible light photons lack sufficient energy for this process. The relatively high photon energy requirement demonstrates why UV radiation is more effective at causing the photoelectric effect than visible light for most metals.

Find the wavelength of photons that eject 0.100-eV electrons from potassium, given that the binding energy is 2.24 eV. Are these photons visible?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The photon energy must equal the sum of binding energy and kinetic energy: $$E_{\text{photon}} = \text{BE} + {\text{KE}}_e$$. We then use $$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}}$$ to find the wavelength.

**Solution**

The total photon energy needed is:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \text{BE} + {\text{KE}}_e = 2.24 \text{ eV} + 0.100 \text{ eV} = 2.34 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Now find the wavelength using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{2.34 \text{ eV}} = 530 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

These photons have a wavelength of 530 nm, which is in the visible spectrum—specifically, green light. The visible spectrum ranges from about 380 nm (violet) to 760 nm (red), so 530 nm falls well within this range. Photons of this wavelength can eject electrons from potassium with a small kinetic energy of 0.100 eV, demonstrating that potassium is sensitive to visible light and is useful for photoelectric applications with visible radiation.

530 nm, yes these photons are visible (green light)

What is the maximum velocity of electrons ejected from a material by 80-nm photons, if they are bound to the material by 4.73 eV?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First find the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons using $${\text{KE}}_e = hf - \text{BE}$$, then use $${\text{KE}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ to find velocity.

**Solution**

Calculate the photon energy using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{80 \text{ nm}} = 15.5 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Find the kinetic energy of ejected electrons:

<div class="equation">
 $${\text{KE}}_e = E_{\text{photon}} - \text{BE} = 15.5 \text{ eV} - 4.73 \text{ eV} = 10.77 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Convert to joules: $${\text{KE}}_e = 10.77 \text{ eV} \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} = 1.72 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J}$$

Use $${\text{KE}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ to find velocity:

<div class="equation">
 $$v = \sqrt{\frac{2{\text{KE}}}{m_e}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(1.72 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J})}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}}} = 1.94 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The 80-nm UV photons carry significant energy (15.5 eV), producing fast-moving photoelectrons with velocities near 2 million m/s—about 0.6% of the speed of light. This is fast enough that we're approaching the regime where relativistic effects begin to matter (though still well within the non-relativistic approximation). The high electron velocity demonstrates the substantial energy transfer possible with short-wavelength UV radiation, which is why UV photodetectors can produce strong electrical signals.

Photoelectrons from a material with a binding energy of 2.71 eV are ejected by 420-nm photons. Once ejected, how long does it take these electrons to travel 2.50 cm to a detection device?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First, find the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons using $${\text{KE}}_e = hf - \text{BE}$$. Then convert this to velocity using $${\text{KE}}_e = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$, assuming nonrelativistic speeds. Finally, use $$t = \frac{d}{v}$$ to find the time.

**Solution**

Calculate the photon energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{420 \text{ nm}} = 2.95 \text{ eV}$$
</div>

Find the kinetic energy of ejected electrons:

<div class="equation">

</div>

Solve for velocity from $${\text{KE}}_e = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$v = \sqrt{\frac{2{\text{KE}}_e}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(3.84 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J})}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}}} = 2.90 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

Calculate the time to travel 2.50 cm:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{0.0250 \text{ m}}{2.90 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s}} = 8.62 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s} = 86.2 \text{ ns}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The photoelectrons travel at about 0.1% the speed of light (290 km/s), which is fast but well below relativistic speeds. They reach the detector in only 86.2 nanoseconds. This rapid transit time is important in photoelectric devices where quick response is essential. The relatively low kinetic energy (0.24 eV) results because the 420-nm photon energy (2.95 eV) is only slightly above the binding energy threshold (2.71 eV).

A laser with a power output of 2.00 mW at a wavelength of 400 nm is projected onto calcium metal. (a) How many electrons per second are ejected? (b) What power is carried away by the electrons, given that the binding energy is 2.71 eV?

**Strategy**

(a) Find the photon energy, then divide the total power by energy per photon to get photons/second. Assuming each photon ejects one electron gives electrons/second. (b) Find the kinetic energy per electron using the photoelectric equation, then multiply by the electron ejection rate.

**Solution for (a)**

Calculate the photon energy using $$hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{400 \text{ nm}} = 3.10 \text{ eV} = 4.96 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Discussion**

The laser produces about 4 trillion electrons per second, but the electrons carry away only 0.251 mW—about 12.6% of the input power. The rest (1.75 mW, or 87.4%) goes into overcoming the binding energy and is converted to heat in the calcium metal. This illustrates the inefficiency of the photoelectric effect for power conversion: most of the photon energy is "wasted" overcoming the work function rather than creating useful kinetic energy in the photoelectrons.

This energy goes into heating the sodium metal. It can be recovered as thermal energy or used to keep the metal at operating temperature.

**Discussion**

Only about 8% of the incident photon energy is carried away as kinetic energy of the electrons; the remaining 92% goes into overcoming the binding energy and heats the metal.

</div>

**Strategy**

Calculate the photon energy, then use the photoelectric equation to find the binding energy. Examine whether the result is physically reasonable.

**Solution for (a)**

Calculate the photon energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{400 \text{ nm}} = 3.10 \text{ eV}$$

**Solution for (b)**

A negative binding energy is physically impossible. Binding energy represents the energy required to remove an electron from a material, which must be positive. A negative value would imply the electron is repelled by the material, contradicting the definition of binding.

**Solution for (c)**

The assumption that is unreasonable is that 400-nm photons can eject electrons with 4.00 eV of kinetic energy. The photon energy (3.10 eV) is less than the claimed kinetic energy of the ejected electrons (4.00 eV). By conservation of energy, this is impossible—the electron cannot have more kinetic energy than the total energy provided by the photon. Either the photon wavelength must be shorter (higher energy), or the electron kinetic energy must be less than 3.10 eV.

(a) −0.90 eV

(b) Negative binding energy is physically impossible

(c) The assumption that 400-nm photons (3.10 eV) can produce 4.00-eV electrons violates energy conservation
