The oscillations of a system in which the net force can be described by Hooke’s
law are of special importance, because they are very common. They are also the
simplest oscillatory systems. **Simple Harmonic Motion** (SHM) is the name given
to oscillatory motion for a system where the net force can be described by
Hooke’s law, and such a system is called a **simple harmonic oscillator**. If
the net force can be described by Hooke’s law and there is no **damping** (by
friction or other non-conservative forces), then a simple harmonic oscillator
will oscillate with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium
position, as shown for an object on a spring in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The
maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the **amplitude** $$X $$ . The
units for amplitude and displacement are the same, but depend on the type of
oscillation. For the object on the spring, the units of amplitude and
displacement are meters; whereas for sound oscillations, they have units of
pressure (and other types of oscillations have yet other units). Because
amplitude is the maximum displacement, it is related to the energy in the
oscillation.

Take-Home Experiment: SHM and the Marble
</div>
Find a bowl or basin that is shaped like a hemisphere on the inside. Place a marble inside the bowl and tilt the bowl periodically so the marble rolls from the bottom of the bowl to equally high points on the sides of the bowl. Get a feel for the force required to maintain this periodic motion. What is the restoring force and what role does the force you apply play in the simple harmonic motion (SHM) of the marble?

![The figure a shows a spring on a frictionless surface attached to a bar or wall from the left side. On the right side of the spring, an object attached to it with mass m, its amplitude is given by X, and X is equal to zero at the equilibrium level. Force F is applied to it from the right side, shown with left direction pointed red arrow and velocity v is equal to zero. A direction point showing the north and west direction is also given alongside this figure as well as with other four figures. In figure b, after the force has been applied the object moves to the left compressing the spring a bit. And the displaced area of the object from its initial point is shown in sketched dots. The F here is equal to zero and the v is max in negative direction. In figure c, the spring has been compressed to the maximum level, and the amplitude is negative X. Now the direction of force changes to the rightward direction, shown with right direction pointed red arrow and the velocity v is zero. In figure d the spring is shown released from the compressed level and the object has moved toward the right side up to the equilibrium level. The F is zero, and the velocity v is maximum. In figure e the spring has been stretched loose to the maximum level and the object has moved to the far right. Now again the velocity here is equal to zero and the direction of force again is to the left hand side, shown here as F is equal to zero.](../resources/Figure_16_03_01.jpg 'An object attached to a spring sliding on a frictionless surface is an uncomplicated simple harmonic oscillator. When displaced from equilibrium, the object performs simple harmonic motion that has an amplitude ( X ) and a period ( T ) . The object’s maximum speed occurs as it passes through equilibrium. The stiffer the spring is, the smaller the period ( T ) . The greater the mass of the object is, the greater the period ( T ) .')
{: #Figure1}

What is so significant about simple harmonic motion? One special thing is that
the period $$T $$ and frequency $$f $$ of a simple harmonic oscillator are
independent of amplitude. The string of a guitar, for example, will oscillate
with the same frequency whether plucked gently or hard. Because the period is
constant, a simple harmonic oscillator can be used as a clock.

Two important factors do affect the period of a simple harmonic oscillator. The
period is related to how stiff the system is. A very stiff object has a large
force constant $$k $$ , which causes the system to have a smaller period. For
example, you can adjust a diving board’s stiffness—the stiffer it is, the faster
it vibrates, and the shorter its period. Period also depends on the mass of the
oscillating system. The more massive the system is, the longer the period. For
example, a heavy person on a diving board bounces up and down more slowly than a
light one.

In fact, the mass $$m $$ and the force constant $$k $$ are the _only_ factors
that affect the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion.

Calculate the Frequency and Period of Oscillations: Bad Shock Absorbers in a Car
</div>
If the shock absorbers in a car go bad, then the car will oscillate at the least provocation, such as when going over bumps in the road and after stopping (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). Calculate the frequency and period of these oscillations for such a car if the car’s mass (including its load) is 900 kg and the force constant ( $$k $$ ) of the suspension system is  $$ 6.53 \times 10^{4}  \text{N/m} $$.

**Strategy**

The frequency of the car’s oscillations will be that of a simple harmonic
oscillator as given in the equation $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} $$ .
The mass and the force constant are both given.

**Solution**

1. Enter the known values of _k_ and _m_\:
   <div class="equation" >
    $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}=\frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{\frac{ 6.53 \times 10^{4}  \text{N/m}}{900 \text{kg}}}. $$
   </div>

2. Calculate the frequency:
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{72.6/{\text{s}}^{2}}=
   1.3656/{\text{s}} \approx 1.36/\text{s}=1.36 \text{Hz}. $$
   </div>

3. You could use $$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} $$ to calculate the period, but it
   is simpler to use the relationship $$T=1/f $$ and substitute the value just
   found for $$f $$ \:
   <div class="equation" >
   $$T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{ 1.356 \text{Hz}}= 0.738 \text{s}. $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

The values of $$T $$ and $$f $$ both seem about right for a bouncing car. You
can observe these oscillations if you push down hard on the end of a car and let
go.

</div>

### The Link between Simple Harmonic Motion and Waves

If a time-exposure photograph of the bouncing car were taken as it drove by, the
headlight would make a wavelike streak, as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).
Similarly, [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows an object bouncing on a spring as it
leaves a wavelike trace of its position on a moving strip of paper. Both waves
are sine functions. All simple harmonic motion is intimately related to sine and
cosine waves.

![The figure shows the front right side of a running car on an uneven rough surface which also shows the driver in the driving seat. There is an oscillating sine wave drawn from left to the right side horizontally throughout the figure.](../resources/Figure_16_03_02.jpg 'The bouncing car makes a wavelike motion. If the restoring force in the suspension system can be described only by Hooke’s law, then the wave is a sine function. (The wave is the trace produced by the headlight as the car moves to the right.)')
{: #Figure2}

![There are two iron paper roll bars standing vertically with a paper strip stitched from one bar to the other. There is a vertical hanging spring just over the middle of the two bars, perpendicular to the strip of the paper, having an object with mass m tied to it. There is a line graph with amplitude scale as X, zero and negative X on the left side of the paper strip, vertically over each other with their points marked. A perpendicular line is drawn through this amplitude scale toward the right with a point T marked over it, showing the time duration of the amplitude. This line has an oscillating wave drawn through it.](../resources/Figure_16_03_03.jpg 'The vertical position of an object bouncing on a spring is recorded on a strip of moving paper, leaving a sine wave.')
{: #Figure3}

The displacement as a function of time _t_ in any simple harmonic motion—that
is, one in which the net restoring force can be described by Hooke’s law, is
given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$x\left(t\right)=X \cos\frac{2 \pi t}{T}, $$
</div>

where $$X $$ is amplitude. At $$t=0 $$ , the initial position is $${x}_{0}=X $$
, and the displacement oscillates back and forth with a period $$T $$.
(When $$t=T $$ , we get $$x=X $$ again because $$\cos 2\pi =1 $$ .)
Furthermore, from this expression for $$x $$ , the velocity $$v $$ as a function
of time is given by:

<div class="equation" >
 $$v\left(t\right)=-{v}_{\text{max}} \sin \left(\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right), $$
</div>

where $${v}_{\text{max}}=2\pi X/T=X\sqrt{k/m} $$ . The object has zero velocity
at maximum displacement—for example, $$v=0 $$ when $$t=0 $$ , and at that time
$$x=X $$ . The minus sign in the first equation for $$v\left(t\right) $$ gives
the correct direction for the velocity. Just after the start of the motion, for
instance, the velocity is negative because the system is moving back toward the
equilibrium point. Finally, we can get an expression for acceleration using
Newton’s second law. \[Then we have $$x\left(t\right), v\left(t\right), t, $$
and $$a\left(t\right) $$ , the quantities needed for kinematics and a
description of simple harmonic motion.\] According to Newton’s second law, the
acceleration is $$a=F/m=kx/m $$. So, $$a\left(t\right) $$ is also a cosine
function:

<div class="equation" >
 $$a\left(t\right)=-\frac{kX}{m}\cos\frac{2\pi t}{T}. $$
</div>

Hence, $$a\left(t\right) $$ is directly proportional to and in the opposite
direction to $$x\left(t\right) $$.

[[Figure 4]](#Figure4) shows the simple harmonic motion of an object on a spring and
presents graphs of $$x\left(t\right),v\left(t\right), $$ and $$a\left(t\right)

$$
versus time.

![In the figure at the top there are ten springboards with objects of different mass values tied to them. This makes some springs highly compressed some as loosely stretched and some at equilibrium, which are shown as red spherical shaped. Alongside the figure there is a scale given for different amplitude values as x equal to positive X, zero and negative X. the upward and downward pointing arrows are shown with a few springboards. In the second figure there are three graphs. The first graph shows distance covered in form of a sine wave starting from a point x units on positive y-axis. The height of the wave above x-axis is marked as amplitude. The gap between two consecutive crests is marked as T. Below first graph there is another graph showing velocity in form of a sine wave starting from the origin downward. In the third graph below the second one, acceleration is shown in the form of sine wave starting from x units on the negative y-axis upward. In the last figure three position of a spring are shown. The first position shows the unstretched length of a spring pendulum. A hand is holding the bob of the pendulum. In the second position the equilibrium position of the spring and bob is shown. This position is lower the first one. In the third case the up and down oscillations of the spring pendulum are shown. The bob is moving x units in upward and downward directions alternatively.](../resources/Figure_16_03_04.jpg "Graphs of \( x(t),v(t) \) and\( a(t) \) versus \( t \) for the motion of an object on a spring. The net force on the object can be described by Hooke&#x2019;s law, and so the object undergoes simple harmonic motion. Note that the initial position has the vertical displacement at its maximum value \( X \) ; \( v \) is initially zero and then negative as the object moves down; and the initial acceleration is negative, back toward the equilibrium position and becomes zero at that point.")

The most important point here is that these equations are mathematically
straightforward and are valid for all simple harmonic motion. They are very
useful in visualizing waves associated with simple harmonic motion, including
visualizing how waves add with one another.

  \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} $$ and $$f=\frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} $$ , where $$m
  $$ is the mass of the system.

* Displacement in simple harmonic motion as a function of time is given by
  $$x\left(t\right)=X \cos \frac{2\pi t}{T}. $$
* The velocity is given by $$v\left(t\right)=-{v}_{\text{max}}\sin\frac{2\pi
  t}{T} $$ , where $${v}_{\text{max}}=\sqrt{k/m}X $$ .

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A type of cuckoo clock keeps time by having a mass bouncing on a spring, usually something cute like a cherub in a chair. What force constant is needed to produce a period of 0.500 s for a 0.0150-kg mass?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a mass-spring system, the period of simple harmonic motion is given by $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$, where $$m$$ is the mass and $$k$$ is the spring constant. We solve this equation for $$k$$ using the given period and mass.

**Solution**

Starting with the period formula:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
</div>

Squaring both sides:

<div class="equation">
 $$T^2 = 4\pi^2\frac{m}{k}$$
</div>

Solving for $$k$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4\pi^2 m}{T^2}$$
</div>

Substituting the given values ($$m = 0.0150$$ kg, $$T = 0.500$$ s):

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4\pi^2(0.0150 \text{ kg})}{(0.500 \text{ s})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4(9.870)(0.0150)}{0.250} = \frac{0.592}{0.250} = 2.37 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

**The spring constant needed is 2.37 N/m.**

**Discussion**

The spring constant of 2.37 N/m is quite small, indicating a very soft spring. This makes sense for a cuckoo clock mechanism—the spring needs to be soft enough that a small 15-gram mass (about half an ounce) can oscillate with a relatively long period of 0.5 seconds.

A stiffer spring would require either a heavier mass or would oscillate too quickly to keep accurate time. The 0.5-second period means the mass completes one full oscillation (up and down) twice per second, or 120 complete cycles per minute. This regular oscillation can be used to drive the clock's timekeeping mechanism.

To put this in perspective, if you hung the 15-gram cherub from this spring, it would stretch only $$x = \frac{mg}{k} = \frac{(0.015)(9.8)}{2.37} = 0.062$$ m or about 6.2 cm under its own weight—a reasonable deflection for a decorative clock ornament.

If the spring constant of a simple harmonic oscillator is doubled, by what factor will the mass of the system need to change in order for the frequency of the motion to remain the same?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The frequency of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by $$f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$. We need to find how mass must change when $$k$$ is doubled such that $$f$$ remains constant.

**Solution**

The initial frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_1 = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k_1}{m_1}}$$
</div>

After doubling the spring constant, we have $$k_2 = 2k_1$$. For the frequency to remain the same ($$f_2 = f_1$$):

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k_1}{m_1}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2k_1}{m_2}}$$
</div>

Squaring both sides and simplifying:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{k_1}{m_1} = \frac{2k_1}{m_2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$m_2 = 2m_1$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The mass must be doubled to keep the frequency constant when the spring constant is doubled. This makes physical sense: a stiffer spring (larger $$k$$) tends to increase the frequency, but a larger mass tends to decrease it. The frequency depends on the ratio $$k/m$$, so to keep this ratio constant when $$k$$ doubles, $$m$$ must also double.

**Answer**

The mass must be increased by a factor of 2.

A 0.500-kg mass suspended from a spring oscillates with a period of 1.50 s. How much mass must be added to the object to change the period to 2.00 s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The period of a mass-spring system is $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$. The spring constant $$k$$ remains the same, so we can find it from the initial conditions, then use it to find the final mass needed for the new period.

**Solution**

From the initial conditions, solve for $$k$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4\pi^2 m_1}{T_1^2} = \frac{4\pi^2(0.500)}{(1.50)^2} = \frac{19.74}{2.25} = 8.77 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

For the new period $$T_2 = 2.00$$ s, find the total mass needed:

<div class="equation">
 $$m_2 = \frac{kT_2^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(8.77)(2.00)^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{35.08}{39.48} = 0.889 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

The mass to be added is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta m = m_2 - m_1 = 0.889 - 0.500 = 0.389 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Adding 0.389 kg (about 78% more mass) to the original 0.500 kg increases the period from 1.50 s to 2.00 s (a 33% increase). This makes physical sense: the period is proportional to $$\sqrt{m}$$, so to increase the period by a factor of 2.00/1.50 = 1.33, we need to increase the mass by a factor of $$(1.33)^2 = 1.78$$. The total mass increases from 0.500 kg to 0.889 kg, which is indeed a factor of 1.78.

0.389 kg

By how much leeway (both percentage and mass) would you have in the selection of the mass of the object in the previous problem if you did not wish the new period to be greater than 2.01 s or less than 1.99 s?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

From the previous problem, we found that adding 0.389 kg to the 0.500 kg mass gives a period of 2.00 s (total mass = 0.889 kg). We need to find the range of total mass that produces periods between 1.99 s and 2.01 s. Since $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$, we first find $$k$$, then calculate the mass range.

**Solution**

From the previous problem, $$T_1 = 1.50$$ s with $$m_1 = 0.500$$ kg. Using $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4\pi^2 m_1}{T_1^2} = \frac{4\pi^2(0.500)}{(1.50)^2} = 8.77 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

For $$T = 1.99$$ s:

<div class="equation">
 $$m_{\text{min}} = \frac{kT^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(8.77)(1.99)^2}{4\pi^2} = 0.878 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

For $$T = 2.01$$ s:

<div class="equation">
 $$m_{\text{max}} = \frac{kT^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(8.77)(2.01)^2}{4\pi^2} = 0.896 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

The target mass is 0.889 kg, so the leeway is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\Delta m = 0.896 - 0.878 = 0.018 \text{ kg} = 18 \text{ g}$$
</div>

This is $$\pm 0.009$$ kg from the target. The percentage leeway is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{0.009}{0.889} \times 100\% = 1.0\%$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The relatively small leeway of ±9 g (±1.0%) shows that the period is quite sensitive to changes in mass. This precision requirement is important in applications where accurate timing is needed, such as in mechanical clocks. The symmetric range around the target value (±9 g) reflects the quadratic relationship between period and mass.

**Answer**

Mass leeway: ±9 g or ±0.009 kg

Percentage leeway: ±1.0%

Suppose you attach the object with mass  $$m $$
 to a vertical spring originally at rest, and let it bounce up and down. You release the object from rest at the spring's original rest length. (a) Show that the spring exerts an upward force of  $$2.00 \mathrm{mg} $$
 on the object at its lowest point. (b) If the spring has a force constant of  $$ 10.0 \text{N/m} $$
 and a 0.25-kg-mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations. (c) Find the maximum velocity.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), we use energy conservation and force analysis. The object starts at the spring's natural length and falls to a lowest point where all gravitational potential energy converts to elastic potential energy. For part (b), we find the amplitude using the equilibrium position. For part (c), we use the relationship $${v}_{\text{max}} = X\sqrt{k/m}$$.

**Solution**

(a) When attached to the vertical spring, the object settles to an equilibrium position where $$kx_0 = mg$$. From the natural length (release point) to the lowest point, the object falls a distance $$x_{\text{low}}$$. Using energy conservation with the release point as the reference:

<div class="equation">
 $$0 = -mg x_{\text{low}} + \frac{1}{2}k x_{\text{low}}^2$$
</div>

Solving for $$x_{\text{low}}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$x_{\text{low}} = \frac{2mg}{k}$$
</div>

At this point, the spring force is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{spring}} = kx_{\text{low}} = k\left(\frac{2mg}{k}\right) = 2mg$$
</div>

This proves the spring exerts an upward force of $$2mg$$ at the lowest point.

(b) The equilibrium position is at $$x_0 = \frac{mg}{k}$$ below the natural length. The amplitude is the distance from equilibrium to either extreme. The lowest point is at $$\frac{2mg}{k}$$ from the natural length, so:

<div class="equation">
 $$X = \frac{2mg}{k} - \frac{mg}{k} = \frac{mg}{k}$$

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">

(c) The maximum velocity is:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{\text{max}} = X\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 0.245\sqrt{\frac{10.0}{0.25}} = 0.245\sqrt{40.0} = 1.55 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The result in part (a) is remarkable: regardless of the mass or spring constant, the spring force at the lowest point is always exactly twice the weight. This occurs because the object falls twice as far as the equilibrium displacement. The amplitude equals the equilibrium displacement for this particular release condition (from the natural length). The maximum velocity of 1.55 m/s occurs as the mass passes through the equilibrium position.

**Answer**

(a) Proven: $$F_{\text{spring}} = 2mg$$ at the lowest point

(b) 0.245 m or 24.5 cm

(c) 1.55 m/s

A diver on a diving board is undergoing simple harmonic motion. Her mass is 55.0 kg and the period of her motion is 0.800 s. The next diver is a male whose period of simple harmonic oscillation is 1.05 s. What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?

</div>
<div class="solution"  markdown="1">
**Strategy**

Since both divers use the same diving board, the spring constant $$k$$ is the same for both. We can use the first diver's data to find $$k$$, then use it with the second diver's period to find his mass.

**Solution**

From the female diver's data, find the spring constant:

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{4\pi^2 m_1}{T_1^2} = \frac{4\pi^2(55.0)}{(0.800)^2} = \frac{2168}{0.640} = 3387 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

Now use this spring constant with the male diver's period:

<div class="equation">
 $$m_2 = \frac{kT_2^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(3387)(1.05)^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{3734}{39.48} = 94.6 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The male diver's mass of 94.6 kg is significantly larger than the female diver's 55.0 kg, which explains his longer period of oscillation (1.05 s vs. 0.800 s). The ratio of periods is 1.05/0.800 = 1.31, and since period is proportional to $$\sqrt{m}$$, the ratio of masses should be $$(1.31)^2 = 1.72$$. Indeed, 94.6/55.0 = 1.72, confirming our calculation. A heavier person causes the diving board to oscillate more slowly.

**Answer**

94.7 kg

Suppose a diving board with no one on it bounces up and down in a simple harmonic motion with a frequency of 4.00 Hz. The board has an effective mass of 10.0 kg. What is the frequency of the simple harmonic motion of a 75.0-kg diver on the board?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We can find the spring constant of the diving board from its initial frequency and mass. Then, we calculate the new frequency when the diver's mass is added to the system.

**Solution**

First, find the spring constant using the board's frequency without a diver. From $$f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$k = 4\pi^2 f^2 m = 4\pi^2(4.00)^2(10.0) = 6320 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

When the 75.0-kg diver stands on the board, the total mass becomes:

<div class="equation">
 $$m_{\text{total}} = 10.0 + 75.0 = 85.0 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

The new frequency is:

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m_{\text{total}}}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{6320}{85.0}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$f_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{74.35} = \frac{8.62}{2\pi} = 1.37 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The frequency decreases significantly from 4.00 Hz to 1.37 Hz when the diver stands on the board. This makes physical sense: the added mass makes the system oscillate more slowly. The ratio of frequencies is $$\frac{f_{\text{new}}}{f_{\text{old}}} = \sqrt{\frac{m_{\text{old}}}{m_{\text{new}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{10.0}{85.0}} = 0.343$$, which confirms our calculation. A diver can feel this slower bouncing when standing on a diving board.

**Answer**

1.37 Hz

![The figure shows a little kid, about ten to twelve months old, standing in a toy jolly jumper, which is tied to the ceiling hook by its four spring belts.](../resources/Figure_16_03_05.jpg "This child&#x2019;s toy relies on springs to keep infants entertained. (credit: By Humboldthead, Flickr)"){: #Figure5}

The device pictured in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) entertains infants while keeping
them from wandering. The child bounces in a harness suspended from a door frame
by a spring.

(a) If the spring stretches 0.250 m while supporting an 8.0-kg child, what is
its spring constant?

(b) What is the time for one complete bounce of this child? (c) What is the
child's maximum velocity if the amplitude of her bounce is 0.200 m?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For part (a), at equilibrium the spring force equals the child's weight, so we can use Hooke's law. For part (b), we use the period formula for a simple harmonic oscillator. For part (c), we use the relationship between maximum velocity, amplitude, and the system parameters.

**Solution**

(a) At equilibrium, the spring force balances the weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$kx = mg$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k = \frac{mg}{x} = \frac{(8.0)(9.80)}{0.250} = \frac{78.4}{0.250} = 314 \text{ N/m}$$
</div>

(b) The period of oscillation is:

<div class="equation">
 $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{8.0}{314}} = 2\pi\sqrt{0.0255} = 2\pi(0.160) = 1.00 \text{ s}$$
</div>

(c) The maximum velocity is:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_{\text{max}} = X\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 0.200\sqrt{\frac{314}{8.0}} = 0.200\sqrt{39.25} = 0.200(6.27) = 1.25 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The spring constant of 314 N/m is reasonable for a child's toy—stiff enough to support the weight without excessive stretching, but not so stiff as to make bouncing uncomfortable. The period of 1.00 s means the child completes one full bounce per second, which is an enjoyable bouncing rate for a young child. The maximum velocity of 1.25 m/s (about 4.5 km/h) occurs as the child passes through the equilibrium position and is safe for this type of toy. Note that this maximum velocity depends on how vigorously the child bounces (the amplitude), while the period does not.

**Answer**

(a) 314 N/m

(b) 1.00 s

(c) 1.25 m/s

A 90.0-kg skydiver hanging from a parachute bounces up and down with a period of 1.50 s. What is the new period of oscillation when a second skydiver, whose mass is 60.0 kg, hangs from the legs of the first, as seen in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).

![The figure shows two skydivers midway through the air, with both with open having their parachutes open.](../resources/Figure_16_03_06.jpg 'The oscillations of one skydiver are about to be affected by a second skydiver. (credit: U.S. Army, www.army.mil)')
{: #Figure6}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

The parachute-skydiver system acts like a spring with constant $$k$$. When the mass increases from $$m_1$$ to $$m_2 = m_1 + 60.0$$ kg, the period changes. We can use the ratio relationship for periods.

**Solution**

Since $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$, the ratio of periods is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{m_2}{m_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{m_1 + 60.0}{m_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{90.0 + 60.0}{90.0}} = \sqrt{\frac{150.0}{90.0}} = \sqrt{1.667} = 1.291$$
</div>

The new period is:

<div class="equation">
 $$T_2 = T_1 \times 1.291 = 1.50 \times 1.291 = 1.94 \text{ s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

When the second skydiver grabs onto the first, the total mass increases from 90.0 kg to 150.0 kg (a 67% increase). The period increases from 1.50 s to 1.94 s (a 29% increase). This makes physical sense because period is proportional to $$\sqrt{m}$$, not directly to $$m$$. The parachute suspension lines act like springs, and adding more mass causes the system to oscillate more slowly. This effect is noticeable to skydivers who perform formations—when skydivers link together, the oscillations become slower.

**Answer**

1.94 s
