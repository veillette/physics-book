When you rise from lounging in a warm bath, your arms feel strangely heavy. This
is because you no longer have the buoyant support of the water. Where does this
buoyant force come from? Why is it that some things float and others do not? Do
objects that sink get any support at all from the fluid? Is your body buoyed by
the atmosphere, or are only helium balloons affected? (
See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

![In figures a and b, an anchor and submarine experience buoyancy due to water. In figure c, helium-filled balloons float due to the buoyancy of air.](../resources/Figure_11_07_01.jpg '(a) Even objects that sink, like this anchor, are partly supported by water when submerged. (b) Submarines have adjustable density (ballast tanks) so that they may float or sink as desired. (credit: Allied Navy) (c) Helium-filled balloons tug upward on their strings, demonstrating air’s buoyant effect. (credit: Crystl)')
{: #Figure1}

Answers to all these questions, and many others, are based on the fact that
pressure increases with depth in a fluid. This means that the upward force on
the bottom of an object in a fluid is greater than the downward force on the top
of the object. There is a net upward, or **buoyant force** on any object in any
fluid. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) If the buoyant force is greater than the
object’s weight, the object will rise to the surface and float. If the buoyant
force is less than the object’s weight, the object will sink. If the buoyant
force equals the object’s weight, the object will remain suspended at that
depth. The buoyant force is always present whether the object floats, sinks, or
is suspended in a fluid.

Buoyant Force
</div>
The buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid.

</div>

![A cylinder of cross-sectional area A experiences an upward force F sub 2 on the bottom of the cylinder and a downward force F sub 1 on its top. Buoyant force is due to the difference between the upward force on the bottom of the cylinder and the downward force on its top.](../resources/Figure_11_07_02.jpg 'Pressure due to the weight of a fluid increases with depth since ( P=h\\rho g ) . This pressure and associated upward force on the bottom of the cylinder are greater than the downward force on the top of the cylinder. Their difference is the buoyant force ( F_{B} ). (Horizontal forces cancel.)')
{: #Figure2}

Just how great is this buoyant force? To answer this question, think about what
happens when a submerged object is removed from a fluid, as
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

![An object immersed in a fluid rises if its buoyant force is greater than its weight and sinks if its buoyant force is less than its weight. By Archimedes’ principle the buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced.](../resources/Figure_11_07_03.jpg '(a) An object submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force ( F_{B} ). If ( F_{B} ) is greater than the weight of the object, the object will rise. If ( F_{B} ) is less than the weight of the object, the object will sink. (b) If the object is removed, it is replaced by fluid having weight ( w_\\text{fl} ). Since this weight is supported by surrounding fluid, the buoyant force must equal the weight of the fluid displaced. That is, ( F_B= w_\\text{fl} ) ,a statement of Archimedes’ principle.')
{: #Figure3}

The space it occupied is filled by fluid having a weight $${w}_{\text{fl}} $$ .
This weight is supported by the surrounding fluid, and so the buoyant force must
equal $${w}_{\text{fl}} $$ , the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. It
is a tribute to the genius of the Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes (
ca. 287–212 B.C.) that he stated this principle long before concepts of force
were well established. Stated in words, **Archimedes’ principle** is as follows:
The buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces. In
equation form, Archimedes’ principle is

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{\text{B}}={w}_{\text{fl}}, $$
</div>

where $${F}_{\text{B}} $$ is the buoyant force and $${w}_{\text{fl}} $$ is the
weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Archimedes’ principle is valid in
general, for any object in any fluid, whether partially or totally submerged.

The density of aluminum foil is 2.7 times the density of water. Take a piece of foil, roll it up into a ball and drop it into water. Does it sink? Why or why not? Can you make it sink?

</div>

### Floating and Sinking

Drop a lump of clay in water. It will sink. Then mold the lump of clay into the
shape of a boat, and it will float. Because of its shape, the boat displaces
more water than the lump and experiences a greater buoyant force. The same is
true of steel ships.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating buoyant force: dependency on shape
</div>
(a) Calculate the buoyant force on 10 000 metric tons  $$\left( 1.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{kg}\right) $$
 of solid steel completely submerged in water, and compare this with the steel’s weight. (b) What is the maximum buoyant force that water could exert on this same steel if it were shaped into a boat that could displace  $$ 1.00 \times 10^{5}  {\text{m}}^{3} $$
 of water?

**Strategy for (a)**

To find the buoyant force, we must find the weight of water displaced. We can do
this by using the densities of water and steel given
in [[Table 1]](../contents/ch11Density#Table1). We note that, since the steel is
completely submerged, its volume and the water’s volume are the same. Once we
know the volume of water, we can find its mass and weight.

**Solution for (a)**

First, we use the definition of density $$\rho =\frac{m}{V} $$ to find the
steel’s volume, and then we substitute values for mass and density. This gives

<div class="equation" >
 $${V}_{\text{st}}=\frac{ {m}_{\text{st}}}{ {\rho }_{\text{st}}}=\frac{ 1.00 \times 10^{7}  \text{kg}}{ 7.8 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}}= 1.28 \times 10^{3}  {\text{m}}^{3}. $$
</div>
Because the steel is completely submerged, this is also the volume of water displaced,  $${V}_{\text{w}} $$ .
 We can now find the mass of water displaced from the relationship between its volume and density, both of which are known. This gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{m}_{w}& =& {\rho }_{w}{V}_{w}=\left( 1.000 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 1.28 \times 10^{3}  {m}^{3}\right)\\ & =&  1.28 \times 10^{6}  \text{kg} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
By Archimedes’ principle, the weight of water displaced is  $${m}_{\text{w}}g $$ ,
 so the buoyant force is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{F}_{B}& =& {w}_{w}={m}_{w}g=\left( 1.28 \times 10^{6}  \text{kg}\right)\left(9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\\ & =&  1.3 \times 10^{7}  \text{N} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
The steel’s weight is  $${m}_{\text{s}}g= 9.80 \times 10^{7}  \text{N} $$ ,
 which is much greater than the buoyant force, so the steel will remain submerged. Note that the buoyant force is rounded to two digits because the density of steel is given to only two digits.

**Strategy for (b)**

Here we are given the maximum volume of water the steel boat can displace. The
buoyant force is the weight of this volume of water.

**Solution for (b)**

The mass of water displaced is found from its relationship to density and
volume, both of which are known. That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{m}_{w}& =& {\rho }_{w}{V}_{w}=\left( 1.000 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 1.00 \times 10^{5}  {m}^{3}\right)\\ & =&  1.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{kg} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
The maximum buoyant force is the weight of this much water, or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{F}_{B}& =& {w}_{w}={m}_{w}g=\left( 1.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{kg}\right)\left(9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\\ & =&  9.80 \times 10^{8}  \text{N} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The maximum buoyant force is ten times the weight of the steel, meaning the ship
can carry a load nine times its own weight without sinking.

### Density and Archimedes’ Principle

Density plays a crucial role in Archimedes’ principle. The average density of an
object is what ultimately determines whether it floats. If its average density
is less than that of the surrounding fluid, it will float. This is because the
fluid, having a higher density, contains more mass and hence more weight in the
same volume. The buoyant force, which equals the weight of the fluid displaced,
is thus greater than the weight of the object. Likewise, an object denser than
the fluid will sink.

The extent to which a floating object is submerged depends on how the object’s
density is related to that of the fluid. In [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), for example,
the unloaded ship has a lower density and less of it is submerged compared with
the same ship loaded. We can derive a quantitative expression for the fraction
submerged by considering density. The fraction submerged is the ratio of the
volume submerged to the volume of the object, or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{fraction submerged =}\frac{ {V}_{\text{sub}}}{ {V}_{\text{obj}}}=\frac{ {V}_{\text{fl}}}{ {V}_{\text{obj}}}. $$
</div>

The volume submerged equals the volume of fluid displaced, which we call $${V}_
{\text{fl}} $$ . Now we can obtain the relationship between the densities by
substituting $$\rho =\frac{m}{V} $$ into the expression. This gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ {V}_{\text{fl}}}{ {V}_{\text{obj}}}=\frac{ {m}_{\text{fl}}/{\rho }_{\text{fl}}}{ {m}_{\text{obj}}/{\overline{\rho }}_{\text{obj}}}, $$
</div>

where $${\overline{\rho }}_{\text{obj}} $$ is the average density of the object
and $${\rho }_{\text{fl}} $$ is the density of the fluid. Since the object
floats, its mass and that of the displaced fluid are equal, and so they cancel
from the equation, leaving

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{fraction submerged}=\frac{ {\overline{\rho }}_{\text{obj}}}{ {\rho }_{\text{fl}}}. $$
</div>

![Two cargo ships. One is floating higher in the water than the other.](../resources/Figure_11_07_04.jpg 'An unloaded ship (a) floats higher in the water than a loaded ship (b).')
{: #Figure4}

We use this last relationship to measure densities. This is done by measuring
the fraction of a floating object that is submerged—for example, with a
hydrometer. It is useful to define the ratio of the density of an object to a
fluid (usually water) as **specific gravity**\:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{specific gravity}=\frac{\overline{\rho }}{ {\rho }_{\text{w}}}, $$
</div>

where $$\overline{\rho } $$ is the average density of the object or substance
and $${\rho }_{\text{w}} $$ is the density of water at 4.00ºC. Specific gravity
is dimensionless, independent of whatever units are used for $$\rho $$ . If an
object floats, its specific gravity is less than one. If it sinks, its specific
gravity is greater than one. Moreover, the fraction of a floating object that is
submerged equals its specific gravity. If an object’s specific gravity is
exactly 1, then it will remain suspended in the fluid, neither sinking nor
floating. Scuba divers try to obtain this state so that they can hover in the
water. We measure the specific gravity of fluids, such as battery acid, radiator
fluid, and urine, as an indicator of their condition. One device for measuring
specific gravity is shown in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).

Calculating Average Density: Floating Woman
</div>
Suppose a 60.0-kg woman floats in freshwater with  $$97.0\% $$
 of her volume submerged when her lungs are full of air. What is her average density?

**Strategy**

We can find the woman’s density by solving the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{fraction submerged}=\frac{ {\overline{\rho }}_{\text{obj}}}{ {\rho }_{\text{fl}}} $$
</div>
for the density of the object. This yields

 $${\overline{\rho }}_{\text{obj}}={\overline{\rho }}_{\text{person}}=\left(\text{fraction submerged}\right)\cdot {\rho }_{\text{fl}}. $$

We know both the fraction submerged and the density of water, and so we can calculate the woman’s density.

**Solution**

Entering the known values into the expression for her density, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $${\overline{\rho }}_{\text{person}}= 0.970\cdot \left(10^{3}\frac{\text{kg}}{ {\text{m}}^{3}}\right)=970\frac{\text{kg}}{ {\text{m}}^{3}}. $$

Her density is less than the fluid density. We expect this because she floats.

{: #Figure6}

There are many obvious examples of lower-density objects or substances floating
in higher-density fluids—oil on water, a hot-air balloon, a bit of cork in wine,
an iceberg, and hot wax in a “lava lamp,” to name a few. Less obvious examples
include lava rising in a volcano and mountain ranges floating on the
higher-density crust and mantle beneath them. Even seemingly solid Earth has
fluid characteristics.

### More Density Measurements

One of the most common techniques for determining density is shown
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7).

![The density of a coin can be determined by measuring its weight in air and its weight submerged in a fluid of known density.](../resources/Figure_11_07_07.jpg '(a) A coin is weighed in air. (b) The apparent weight of the coin is determined while it is completely submerged in a fluid of known density. These two measurements are used to calculate the density of the coin.')
{: #Figure7}

An object, here a coin, is weighed in air and then weighed again while submerged
in a liquid. The density of the coin, an indication of its authenticity, can be
calculated if the fluid density is known. This same technique can also be used
to determine the density of the fluid if the density of the coin is known. All
of these calculations are based on Archimedes’ principle.

Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on the object equals the
weight of the fluid displaced. This, in turn, means that the object _appears_ to
weigh less when submerged; we call this measurement the object’s _apparent
weight_. The object suffers an _apparent weight loss_ equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced. Alternatively, on balances that measure mass, the object
suffers an _apparent mass loss_ equal to the mass of fluid displaced. That is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{apparent weight loss = weight of fluid displaced} $$
</div>

or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{apparent mass loss = mass of fluid displaced.} $$
</div>

The next example illustrates the use of this technique.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Density: Is the Coin Authentic?
</div>
The mass of an ancient Greek coin is determined in air to be 8.630 g. When the coin is submerged in water as shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7), its apparent mass is 7.800 g. Calculate its density, given that water has a density of  $$ 1.000 {\text{g/cm}}^{3} $$
 and that effects caused by the wire suspending the coin are negligible.

**Strategy**

To calculate the coin’s density, we need its mass (which is given) and its
volume. The volume of the coin equals the volume of water displaced. The volume
of water displaced $${V}_{\text{w}} $$ can be found by solving the equation for
density $$\rho =\frac{m}{V} $$ for $$V $$.

**Solution**

The volume of water is $${V}_{\text{w}}=\frac{ {m}_{\text{w}}}{ {\rho }_
{\text{w}}} $$ where $${m}_{\text{w}} $$ is the mass of water displaced. As
noted, the mass of the water displaced equals the apparent mass loss, which is
$${m}_{\text{w}}=8.630 \text{g}-7.800 \text{g}=0.830 \text{g} $$ . Thus the
volume of water is $${V}_{\text{w}}=\frac{0.830 \text{g}}{1.000
\text{g}{\text{/cm}}^{3}}= 0.830 {\text{cm}}^{3} $$ . This is also the volume of
the coin, since it is completely submerged. We can now find the density of the
coin using the definition of density:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\rho }_{\text{c}}=\frac{ {m}_{\text{c}}}{ {V}_{c}}=\frac{8.630 \text{g}}{0.830\text{cm}^{3}}= 10.4 {\text{g/cm}}^{3}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

You can see from [[Table 1]](../contents/ch11Density#Table1) that this density is very
close to that of pure silver, appropriate for this type of ancient coin. Most
modern counterfeits are not pure silver.

</div>

This brings us back to Archimedes’ principle and how it came into being. As the
story goes, the king of Syracuse gave Archimedes the task of determining whether
the royal crown maker was supplying a crown of pure gold. The purity of gold is
difficult to determine by color (it can be diluted with other metals and still
look as yellow as pure gold), and other analytical techniques had not yet been
conceived. Even ancient peoples, however, realized that the density of gold was
greater than that of any other then-known substance. Archimedes purportedly
agonized over his task and had his inspiration one day while at the public
baths, pondering the support the water gave his body. He came up with his
now-famous principle, saw how to apply it to determine density, and ran naked
down the streets of Syracuse crying “Eureka!” (Greek for “I have found it”).
Similar behavior can be observed in contemporary physicists from time to time!

### Section Summary

- Buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid. If the
  buoyant force is greater than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the
  surface and float. If the buoyant force is less than the object’s weight, the
  object will sink. If the buoyant force equals the object’s weight, the object
  will remain suspended at that depth. The buoyant force is always present
  whether the object floats, sinks, or is suspended in a fluid.
- Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on an object equals the
  weight of the fluid it displaces.
- Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid (usually
  water).

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
More force is required to pull the plug in a full bathtub than when it is empty. Does this contradict Archimedes' principle? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider whether the increased force is due to buoyancy or to water pressure acting on the plug.

**Solution:**
**No, this does not contradict Archimedes' principle.** The extra force required is due to water pressure, not buoyancy.

When the tub is full, water pressure pushes down on the plug:
$$ P = \rho g h $$

where $$ h $$ is the depth of water above the plug. This creates a downward force:
$$ F = P \times A = \rho g h A $$

For a plug with area 20 cm² at 30 cm depth:
$$ F = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(9.8 \text{ m/s}^2)(0.30 \text{ m})(0.002 \text{ m}^2) \approx 6 \text{ N} $$

Archimedes' principle concerns the buoyant force on a *submerged object*, which equals the weight of displaced fluid. The plug displaces very little water (it mostly fills the drain hole), so its buoyant force is small. The significant force is the hydrostatic pressure acting on the plug's surface.

**Discussion:**
Archimedes' principle and hydrostatic pressure are related but distinct concepts. The buoyant force results from the *difference* in pressure on top and bottom of an object. For the plug, water pushes mainly on one side (top), with air at atmospheric pressure below. This pressure difference, not buoyancy, explains why pulling the plug is harder when the tub is full.

Do fluids exert buoyant forces in a "weightless" environment, such as in the space shuttle? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the origin of buoyant force (pressure difference due to gravity) and what happens when effective gravity is zero.

**Solution:**
**No, fluids do not exert buoyant forces in a weightless (free-fall) environment.**

Buoyancy arises from the pressure difference between the top and bottom of an object:
$$ F_B = (P_{\text{bottom}} - P_{\text{top}}) \times A = \rho g h A = \rho g V $$

This pressure difference exists because fluid pressure increases with depth due to gravity ($$ P = \rho g h $$). In orbit or free-fall:
- The spacecraft and everything in it are accelerating equally toward Earth
- Effective gravity inside is zero ($$ g_{\text{effective}} = 0 $$)
- Pressure no longer varies with position: $$ P = \rho (0) h = 0 $$
- No pressure difference means no buoyant force: $$ F_B = \rho (0) V = 0 $$

**Discussion:**
This has practical consequences on the International Space Station:
- Air bubbles don't rise in liquids; they stay wherever they form
- Objects don't float or sink—they remain wherever placed
- Astronauts can't use density to separate mixtures
- Water forms spheres due to surface tension, not puddles held down by gravity

Centrifuges on spacecraft can create artificial gravity to enable density-based separation when needed, such as in blood analysis equipment.

Will the same ship float higher in salt water than in freshwater? Explain your answer.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Apply the relationship between fraction submerged and density ratio, and compare densities of salt and fresh water.

**Solution:**
**Yes, a ship floats higher in salt water than in freshwater.**

For a floating object: fraction submerged = $$ \frac{\bar{\rho}_{\text{object}}}{\rho_{\text{fluid}}} $$

Since salt water is denser than freshwater ($$ \rho_{\text{salt}} \approx 1025 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$ vs $$ \rho_{\text{fresh}} = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$), a smaller fraction of the ship needs to be submerged to displace enough weight of water to support the ship.

Quantitative example for a ship with average density 800 kg/m³:
- In freshwater: fraction submerged = 800/1000 = 80%
- In salt water: fraction submerged = 800/1025 = 78%

The ship rides about 2.5% higher in salt water.

**Discussion:**
This effect is noticeable in practice. Ships have "Plimsoll lines" marked on their hulls showing the maximum safe load levels for different water types (freshwater, summer saltwater, winter saltwater, etc.). When a ship travels from the ocean up a freshwater river, it sinks lower in the water and may need to reduce cargo. The Dead Sea (33% salt) is famous for how high swimmers float—roughly 30% of the body is above water compared to only 3-5% in freshwater.

Marbles dropped into a partially filled bathtub sink to the bottom. Part of their weight is supported by buoyant force, yet the downward force on the bottom of the tub increases by exactly the weight of the marbles. Explain why.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Apply Newton's third law and trace all forces in the system, including the buoyant force reaction.

**Solution:**
The downward force on the tub bottom increases by exactly the marbles' weight because of **Newton's third law applied to buoyancy**.

Force analysis:
1. **On the marbles:** The water exerts an upward buoyant force $$ F_B $$ on the marbles
2. **Reaction force:** By Newton's third law, the marbles push down on the water with force $$ F_B $$
3. **This force is transmitted:** The water transmits this additional downward force to the tub bottom
4. **The marbles also rest on the bottom:** They exert a normal force equal to their apparent weight ($$ W - F_B $$)

Total additional force on tub bottom:
$$ F_{\text{total}} = (W - F_B) + F_B = W $$

The buoyant force doesn't "disappear"—it's transmitted through the water to the tub bottom as an increase in hydrostatic pressure. The system is in equilibrium: the tub supports the weight of the water PLUS the full weight of the marbles.

**Discussion:**
This demonstrates that buoyancy is an internal force within the water-marble system. When calculating the force on the tub, we must consider the entire contents (water + marbles). The same principle explains why a boat floating in a swimming pool exerts a force on the pool floor equal to the boat's weight—the water transmits the weight to the pool bottom even though the boat floats.

$$ \text{fraction submerged} = \frac{\rho_{\text{ice}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} = \frac{917 \text{ kg/m}^3}{1000 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.917 = 91.7\% $$

**Discussion:**
Approximately **91.7%** of the ice is submerged when floating in freshwater. This means only about 8.3% of an iceberg's volume is visible above water—the origin of the phrase "tip of the iceberg." This property is unusual and vital for life: most substances are denser in their solid form than liquid form, but water expands when it freezes, making ice less dense. This allows ice to float, insulating the water below and allowing aquatic life to survive winter in frozen lakes. If ice sank, lakes would freeze from the bottom up, likely killing most aquatic organisms.

Logs sometimes float vertically in a lake because one end has become water-logged and denser than the other. What is the average density of a uniform-diameter log that floats with  $$20.0\% $$
 of its length above water?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the relationship between fraction submerged and density ratio for a floating object.

**Solution:**
If 20.0% is above water, then 80.0% is submerged.

For a floating object:
$$ \text{fraction submerged} = \frac{\bar{\rho}_{\text{log}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} $$

$$ 0.800 = \frac{\bar{\rho}_{\text{log}}}{1000 \text{ kg/m}^3} $$

$$ \bar{\rho}_{\text{log}} = 0.800 \times 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 = 800 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

**Discussion:**
The average density of the log is **800 kg/m³**. This is less than water (1000 kg/m³), which is consistent with the log floating. Fresh dry wood typically has a density of 400-700 kg/m³, while waterlogged wood can approach 1000 kg/m³. An average density of 800 kg/m³ suggests partially waterlogged wood, consistent with the scenario described where one end is heavier than the other.

Find the density of a fluid in which a hydrometer having a density of  $$0.750 \text{g}\text{/mL} $$
 floats with  $$92.0 \% $$
 of its volume submerged.

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
For a floating object, the fraction submerged equals the ratio of object density to fluid density. Solve for fluid density.

**Solution:**
Given:
- Hydrometer density: $$ \rho_{\text{hydrometer}} = 0.750 \text{ g/mL} = 750 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
- Fraction submerged: 0.920

Using the floating condition:
$$ \text{fraction submerged} = \frac{\rho_{\text{hydrometer}}}{\rho_{\text{fluid}}} $$

Solving for fluid density:
$$ \rho_{\text{fluid}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{hydrometer}}}{\text{fraction submerged}} = \frac{750 \text{ kg/m}^3}{0.920} = 815 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

**Discussion:**
The fluid density is approximately **815 kg/m³**. This is less than water (1000 kg/m³), so the fluid could be ethyl alcohol (790 kg/m³) or a similar organic liquid. Hydrometers work on this principle—the depth to which they sink indicates fluid density. Since the hydrometer has lower density than water, it would float higher (less submerged) in water than in this fluid, allowing density measurements by reading calibration marks on the stem.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the floating condition: fraction submerged = $$ \bar{\rho}_{\text{body}} / \rho_{\text{fluid}} $$

**Solution:**

**(a) In freshwater** ($$ \rho = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$):

$$ \text{fraction submerged} = \frac{995 \text{ kg/m}^3}{1000 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.995 = 99.5\% $$

**(b) In salt water** ($$ \rho = 1027 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$):

$$ \text{fraction submerged} = \frac{995 \text{ kg/m}^3}{1027 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.969 = 96.9\% $$

**Discussion:**
In freshwater, **99.5%** of your body is submerged (only 0.5% above water). In salt water, **96.9%** is submerged (3.1% above water). The difference is significant—you float about 6× higher in salt water! This explains why it's easier to float in the ocean than in a pool. With lungs full of air, body density decreases to about 950 kg/m³, making floating even easier. The given density of 995 kg/m³ represents a person with lungs partially inflated.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
The apparent mass loss equals the mass of water displaced. Use this to find volume, then calculate density.

**Solution:**

**(a) Mass of water displaced:**
$$ m_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{air}} - m_{\text{apparent}} = 540 \text{ g} - 342 \text{ g} = 198 \text{ g} $$

**(b) Volume of the rock:**
Since the rock is fully submerged, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume.
$$ V = \frac{m_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} = \frac{198 \text{ g}}{1.00 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 198 \text{ cm}^3 $$

**(c) Average density of the rock:**
$$ \rho_{\text{rock}} = \frac{m_{\text{rock}}}{V} = \frac{540 \text{ g}}{198 \text{ cm}^3} = 2.73 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

The rock's density of **2.73 g/cm³** (or 2730 kg/m³) is **consistent with granite**, which has a density range of 2.65-2.75 g/cm³.

(d) If her lung capacity is 1.75 L, is she able to float without treading water with her lungs filled with air?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use apparent mass loss to find displaced water mass and volume, calculate density, then determine if adding air volume allows floating.

**Solution:**

**(a) Mass of water displaced:**
$$ m_{\text{water}} = 62.0 \text{ kg} - 0.0850 \text{ kg} = 61.915 \text{ kg} $$

**(b) Her volume:**
$$ V = \frac{m_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} = \frac{61.915 \text{ kg}}{1000 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.0619 \text{ m}^3 = 61.9 \text{ L} $$

**(c) Her density (lungs empty):**
$$ \rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{62.0 \text{ kg}}{0.0619 \text{ m}^3} = 1001 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

**(d) Can she float with lungs full?**

With lungs full of air (adding 1.75 L volume but negligible mass):
$$ V_{\text{total}} = 61.9 \text{ L} + 1.75 \text{ L} = 63.65 \text{ L} = 0.0637 \text{ m}^3 $$

New average density:
$$ \rho_{\text{new}} = \frac{62.0 \text{ kg}}{0.0637 \text{ m}^3} = 974 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

Since $$ 974 \text{ kg/m}^3 < 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$, **yes, she can float** with lungs filled with air.

**Discussion:**
With empty lungs, her density (1001 kg/m³) slightly exceeds water's, so she sinks. With full lungs, her density drops to 974 kg/m³, allowing her to float with about 2.6% of her volume above water. This demonstrates why proper breathing technique is important for swimming—filling the lungs significantly reduces body density.

Some fish have a density slightly less than that of water and must exert a force (swim) to stay submerged. What force must an 85.0-kg grouper exert to stay submerged in salt water if its body density is  $$1015 {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Since the fish density is less than saltwater density, the buoyant force exceeds its weight. The fish must exert a downward force equal to this difference to remain submerged.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Calculate the fish's volume*

$$ V = \frac{m}{\rho_{\text{fish}}} = \frac{85.0 \text{ kg}}{1015 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.0837 \text{ m}^3 $$

*Step 2: Calculate the buoyant force*

Using saltwater density $$ \rho_{\text{saltwater}} = 1025 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:

$$ F_B = \rho_{\text{saltwater}} V g = (1025 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.0837 \text{ m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 841 \text{ N} $$

*Step 3: Calculate the fish's weight*

$$ W = mg = (85.0 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 833 \text{ N} $$

*Step 4: Find the required downward force*

$$ F_{\text{down}} = F_B - W = 841 \text{ N} - 833 \text{ N} = 8.21 \text{ N} $$

**Discussion:**
The grouper must exert a downward force of approximately **8.2 N** to stay submerged. This is less than 1% of its weight—a relatively small effort. The fish achieves this by swimming with a slight downward angle or adjusting its swim bladder volume. Since the grouper's density (1015 kg/m³) is close to but less than saltwater (1025 kg/m³), it's nearly neutrally buoyant. Many fish adjust their swim bladder (a gas-filled organ) to achieve neutral buoyancy, allowing them to hover effortlessly at a chosen depth. This grouper is slightly "light" and naturally wants to float upward, requiring active swimming to maintain depth.

(a) Calculate the buoyant force on a 2.00-L helium balloon. (b) Given the mass of the rubber in the balloon is 1.50 g, what is the net vertical force on the balloon if it is let go? You can neglect the volume of the rubber.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
The buoyant force equals the weight of air displaced. The net force is buoyant force minus the weight of the balloon (rubber + helium).

**Solution:**

**(a) Buoyant force:**

The balloon displaces air with volume $$ V = 2.00 \text{ L} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3 $$

Using air density $$ \rho_{\text{air}} = 1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:

$$ F_B = \rho_{\text{air}} V g = (1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3)(2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) $$

$$ F_B = 0.0253 \text{ N} = 2.53 \times 10^{-2} \text{ N} $$

**(b) Net vertical force:**

Weight of rubber: $$ W_{\text{rubber}} = (1.50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 0.0147 \text{ N} $$

Weight of helium ($$ \rho_{\text{He}} = 0.179 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$):
$$ m_{\text{He}} = (0.179 \text{ kg/m}^3)(2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3) = 3.58 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg} $$
$$ W_{\text{He}} = (3.58 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 0.00351 \text{ N} $$

Net upward force:
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_B - W_{\text{rubber}} - W_{\text{He}} = 0.0253 - 0.0147 - 0.00351 = 0.00709 \text{ N} $$

$$ F_{\text{net}} \approx 7.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ N} $$ (upward)

**Discussion:**
The buoyant force is approximately **0.025 N**, and the net upward force is about **7.1 mN**. The balloon rises because helium is much less dense than air (about 14% of air's density), creating a net upward force. This small force explains why helium balloons rise slowly and can be held down by a light string.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use density to find volume, then calculate buoyant force from air displaced.

**Solution:**

**(a) Volume:**
$$ V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{80 \text{ kg}}{955 \text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.0838 \text{ m}^3 $$

**(b) Buoyant force from air:**

Using air density $$ \rho_{\text{air}} = 1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:

$$ F_B = \rho_{\text{air}} V g = (1.29 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.0838 \text{ m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) $$

$$ F_B = 1.06 \text{ N} $$

**(c) Ratio of buoyant force to weight:**

$$ W = mg = (80 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 784 \text{ N} $$

$$ \frac{F_B}{W} = \frac{1.06 \text{ N}}{784 \text{ N}} = 0.00135 = 0.135\% $$

**Discussion:**
The man's volume is about **0.084 m³** (84 liters). Air exerts a buoyant force of approximately **1.06 N** on him, which is only about **0.14%** of his weight. This explains why we don't notice atmospheric buoyancy in everyday life—it makes us about 1 N (~0.2 lb) lighter, which is imperceptible. However, this effect is measurable in precision experiments and must be corrected for when weighing objects in air versus vacuum.

What fraction of an iron anchor's weight will be supported by buoyant force when submerged in saltwater?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
The buoyant force equals the weight of saltwater displaced. The fraction supported is the ratio of buoyant force to weight.

**Solution:**

For a submerged object, the buoyant force is:
$$ F_B = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V g $$

The weight of the iron anchor is:
$$ W = \rho_{\text{iron}} V g $$

The fraction of weight supported by buoyancy:
$$ \frac{F_B}{W} = \frac{\rho_{\text{fluid}} V g}{\rho_{\text{iron}} V g} = \frac{\rho_{\text{fluid}}}{\rho_{\text{iron}}} $$

Using $$ \rho_{\text{saltwater}} = 1025 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$ and $$ \rho_{\text{iron}} = 7870 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$:

$$ \frac{F_B}{W} = \frac{1025}{7870} = 0.130 = 13.0\% $$

**Discussion:**
Approximately **13%** of the iron anchor's weight is supported by the buoyant force when submerged in saltwater. This means the anchor has an "apparent weight" of about 87% of its true weight when underwater. While this doesn't make the anchor float (since 13% < 100%), it does explain why heavy objects feel lighter when submerged—divers can lift anchors and other heavy equipment underwater more easily than in air.

Scurrilous con artists have been known to represent gold-plated tungsten ingots as pure gold and sell them to the greedy at prices much below gold value but deservedly far above the cost of tungsten. With what accuracy must you be able to measure the mass of such an ingot in and out of water to tell that it is almost pure tungsten rather than pure gold?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
The apparent mass loss in water is proportional to density. Compare the fractional difference in apparent mass loss for gold versus tungsten.

**Solution:**

From Table 1:
- Gold density: $$ \rho_{\text{Au}} = 19.32 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$
- Tungsten density: $$ \rho_{\text{W}} = 19.30 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 $$

For an ingot of mass $$ m $$ and density $$ \rho $$:
- Volume: $$ V = m/\rho $$
- Apparent mass loss in water: $$ \Delta m = \rho_{\text{water}} V = \rho_{\text{water}} (m/\rho) = m(\rho_{\text{water}}/\rho) $$

For gold:
$$ \Delta m_{\text{Au}} = m \frac{1000}{19,320} = 0.05176m $$

For tungsten:
$$ \Delta m_{\text{W}} = m \frac{1000}{19,300} = 0.05181m $$

The fractional difference:
$$ \frac{\Delta m_{\text{W}} - \Delta m_{\text{Au}}}{\Delta m_{\text{Au}}} = \frac{0.05181 - 0.05176}{0.05176} = \frac{0.00005}{0.05176} = 0.00097 \approx 0.0001 = 0.01\% $$

Actually, a more direct calculation of the percentage difference:
$$ \frac{\rho_{\text{Au}} - \rho_{\text{W}}}{\rho_{\text{Au}}} \times 100\% = \frac{19.32 - 19.30}{19.32} \times 100\% = 0.10\% $$

The measurement precision needed is approximately **0.1%** or better (closer to **0.006%** considering the measurement must detect this small difference reliably).

**Discussion:**
The required measurement accuracy is about **0.01%** or better. This is extremely challenging! Gold and tungsten have nearly identical densities (differing by only 0.1%), making them difficult to distinguish by density measurements alone. A 1-kg ingot would show an apparent mass difference of only about 1 gram when measured in water—easily obscured by measurement error. This is why gold-plated tungsten is a credible fraud: tungsten is much cheaper than gold but has almost the same density. Detecting such fraud requires either very precise density measurements (to 3-4 decimal places), destructive testing (drilling or cutting), or sophisticated techniques like X-ray fluorescence or ultrasound imaging.

The mass of the mattress when blown up is 2 kg. How heavy a person could the air mattress hold if it is placed in freshwater?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Calculate the maximum buoyant force (when fully submerged), subtract the mattress weight to find the maximum additional load.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Calculate the mattress volume*
$$ V = (1.00 \text{ m})(2.00 \text{ m})(0.15 \text{ m}) = 0.30 \text{ m}^3 $$

*Step 2: Calculate maximum buoyant force (fully submerged)*
$$ F_{B,\text{max}} = \rho_{\text{water}} V g = (1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.30 \text{ m}^3)(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) $$
$$ F_{B,\text{max}} = 2940 \text{ N} $$

*Step 3: Calculate weight of mattress*
$$ W_{\text{mattress}} = m g = (2 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 19.6 \text{ N} $$

*Step 4: Calculate maximum additional weight supported*
$$ W_{\text{person}} = F_{B,\text{max}} - W_{\text{mattress}} = 2940 \text{ N} - 19.6 \text{ N} = 2920 \text{ N} $$

*Step 5: Convert to mass*
$$ m_{\text{person}} = \frac{W_{\text{person}}}{g} = \frac{2920 \text{ N}}{9.80 \text{ m/s}^2} = 298 \text{ kg} $$

**Discussion:**
The air mattress could support a person weighing up to approximately **298 kg** (about 660 pounds) before becoming fully submerged. In practice, you'd want to stay well below this limit to keep the mattress floating above water. A typical adult (70-80 kg) would only submerge about 25-30% of the mattress, leaving plenty of freeboard. The large surface area and 15 cm thickness provide substantial buoyancy.

$$ V_{\text{full}} = \frac{75.0 \text{ kg}}{(1000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(0.950)} = 0.07895 \text{ m}^3 $$

*Lung capacity:*
$$ V_{\text{lungs}} = V_{\text{full}} - V_{\text{empty}} = 0.07895 - 0.07732 = 0.00163 \text{ m}^3 $$

$$ V_{\text{lungs}} = 1.63 \text{ L} $$

**(b) Is this reasonable?**

Yes, this is very reasonable. Typical human lung capacity values:
- Tidal volume (normal breath): 0.5 L
- Vital capacity (maximum breath): 4-6 L
- Functional residual capacity: ~2.5 L

A value of **1.63 L** represents a moderate breath, less than maximum capacity but more than a normal resting breath. This is consistent with the "floating gently" scenario described.

**Discussion:**
The lung capacity calculated is approximately **1.6 liters**, which is a reasonable value for a moderate inhalation. The calculation shows how sensitive floating is to lung volume—just 1.6 L of air (adding ~2% to body volume) raises the man 2 percentage points higher in the water. This explains why swimmers can control their buoyancy by adjusting their breathing.
