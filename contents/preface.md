Welcome to _General Physics_. This textbook is derived from _College Physics_,
an OpenStax resource. OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, whose
mission is to improve student access to education. This textbook was written to
increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest
standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.

### About _General Physics_

_General Physics_ meets standard scope and sequence requirements for an
introductory algebra-based physics course. The text is grounded in real-world
examples to help students grasp fundamental physics concepts. It requires
knowledge of algebra and some trigonometry, but not calculus. _General Physics_
includes learning objectives, concept questions, links to labs and simulations,
and ample practice opportunities for traditional physics application problems.

#### Coverage and Scope

General Physics is organized such that topics are introduced conceptually with a
steady progression to precise definitions and analytical applications. The
analytical aspect (problem-solving) is tied back to the conceptual before moving
on to another topic. Each introductory chapter, for example, opens with an
engaging photograph relevant to the subject of the chapter and interesting
applications that are easy for most students to visualize.

#### Concepts and Calculations

The ability to calculate does not guarantee conceptual understanding. In order
to unify conceptual, analytical, and calculation skills within the learning
process, we have integrated Strategies and Discussions throughout the text.

#### Key Features

##### Learning Objectives

Every module begins with a set of learning objectives. These objectives are
designed to guide the instructor in deciding what content to include or assign,
and to guide the student with respect to what they can expect to learn. After
completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to
demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.

##### Call-Outs

Key definitions, concepts, and equations are called out with a special design
treatment. Call-outs are designed to catch readers’ attention, to make it clear
that a specific term, concept, or equation is particularly important, and to
provide easy reference for a student reviewing content.

##### Key Terms

Key terms are in bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions
of key terms are also listed in the Glossary, which appears at the end of the
module.

##### Worked Examples

Worked examples have four distinct parts to promote both analytical and
conceptual skills. Worked examples are introduced in words, always using some
application that should be of interest. This is followed by a Strategy section
that emphasizes the concepts involved and how solving the problem relates to
those concepts. This is followed by the mathematical Solution and Discussion.

Many worked examples contain multiple-part problems to help the students learn
how to approach normal situations, in which problems tend to have multiple
parts. Finally, worked examples employ the techniques of the problem-solving
strategies so that students can see how those strategies succeed in practice as
well as in theory.

##### Problem-Solving Strategies

Problem-solving strategies are first presented in a special section and
subsequently appear at crucial points in the text where students can benefit
most from them. Problem-solving strategies have a logical structure that is
reinforced in the worked examples and supported in certain places by line
drawings that illustrate various steps.

##### Take-Home Investigations

Take Home Investigations provide the opportunity for students to apply or
explore what they have learned with a hands-on activity.

##### Simulations

Where applicable, students are directed to the interactive PhET physics
simulations developed by the University of Colorado. There they can further
explore the physics concepts they have learned about in the module.

##### Summary

Module summaries are thorough and functional and present all important
definitions and equations. Students are able to find the definitions of all
terms and symbols as well as their physical relationships. The structure of the
summary makes plain the fundamental principles of the module or collection and
serves as a useful study guide.

##### Glossary

At the end of every module or chapter is a Glossary containing definitions of
the key terms in the module or chapter.

##### End-of-Module Problems

At the end of every chapter is a set of Conceptual Questions and/or skills-based
Problems &amp; Exercises. Conceptual Questions challenge students’ ability to
explain what they have learned conceptually, independent of the mathematical
details. Problems &amp; Exercises challenge students to apply both concepts and
skills to solve mathematical physics problems. Online, every other problem
includes an answer that students can reveal immediately by clicking on a “Show
Solution” button.

In addition to traditional skills-based problems, there are three special types
of end-of-module problems: Integrated Concept Problems, Unreasonable Results
Problems, and Construct Your Own Problems. All of these problems are indicated
with a subtitle preceding the problem.

##### Integrated Concept Problems

In Integrated Concept Problems, students are asked to apply what they have
learned about two or more concepts to arrive at a solution to a problem. These
problems require a higher level of thinking because, before solving a problem,
students have to recognize the combination of strategies required to solve it.

##### Unreasonable Results

In Unreasonable Results Problems, students are challenged to not only apply
concepts and skills to solve a problem, but also to analyze the answer with
respect to how likely or realistic it really is. These problems contain a
premise that produces an unreasonable answer and are designed to further
emphasize that properly applied physics must describe nature accurately and is
not simply the process of solving equations.

##### Construct Your Own Problem

These problems require students to construct the details of a problem, justify
their starting assumptions, show specific steps in the problem’s solution, and
finally discuss the meaning of the result. These types of problems relate well
to both conceptual and analytical aspects of physics, emphasizing that physics
must describe nature. Often they involve an integration of topics from more than
one chapter. Unlike other problems, solutions are not provided since there is no
single correct answer. Instructors should feel free to direct students regarding
the level and scope of their considerations. Whether the problem is solved and
described correctly will depend on initial assumptions.
