The human ear has a tremendous range and sensitivity. It can give us a wealth of
simple information—such as pitch, loudness, and direction. And from its input we
can detect musical quality and nuances of voiced emotion. How is our hearing
related to the physical qualities of sound, and how does the hearing mechanism
work?

**Hearing** is the perception of sound. (Perception is commonly defined to be
awareness through the senses, a typically circular definition of higher-level
processes in living organisms.) Normal human hearing encompasses frequencies
from 20 to 20 000 Hz, an impressive range. Sounds below 20 Hz are called **infrasound**, whereas those above 20 000 Hz are **ultrasound**. Neither is
perceived by the ear, although infrasound can sometimes be felt as vibrations.
When we do hear low-frequency vibrations, such as the sounds of a diving board,
we hear the individual vibrations only because there are higher-frequency sounds
in each. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that of humans. Dogs
can hear sounds as high as 30 000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to
100 000-Hz sounds. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog
whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing. Elephants are
known to respond to frequencies below 20 Hz.

The perception of frequency is called **pitch**. Most of us have excellent
relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different
frequency from another. Typically, we can discriminate between two sounds if
their frequencies differ by 0.3% or more. For example, 500.0 and 501.5 Hz are
noticeably different. Pitch perception is directly related to frequency and is
not greatly affected by other physical quantities such as intensity. Musical **notes**{: class="term"} are particular sounds that can be produced by most
instruments and in Western music have particular names. Combinations of notes
constitute music. Some people can identify musical notes, such as A-sharp, C, or
E-flat, just by listening to them. This uncommon ability is called perfect
pitch.

The ear is remarkably sensitive to low-intensity sounds. The lowest audible
intensity or threshold is about $$ 10^{-12} {\text{W/m}}^{2} $$ or 0 dB. Sounds
as much as $$ 10^{12} $$ more intense can be briefly tolerated. Very few
measuring devices are capable of observations over a range of a trillion. The
perception of intensity is called **loudness**. At a given frequency, it is
possible to discern differences of about 1 dB, and a change of 3 dB is easily
noticed. But loudness is not related to intensity alone. Frequency has a major
effect on how loud a sound seems. The ear has its maximum sensitivity to
frequencies in the range of 2000 to 5000 Hz, so that sounds in this range are
perceived as being louder than, say, those at 500 or 10 000 Hz, even when they
all have the same intensity. Sounds near the high- and low-frequency extremes of
the hearing range seem even less loud, because the ear is even less sensitive at
those frequencies. [[Table 1]](#Table1) gives the dependence of certain human
hearing perceptions on physical quantities.

When a violin plays middle C, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the
same note. The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of
frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of
frequencies and intensities **tone**{: class="term"} quality, or more commonly
the **timbre**{: class="term"} of the sound. It is more difficult to correlate
timbre perception to physical quantities than it is for loudness or pitch
perception. Timbre is more subjective. Terms such as dull, brilliant, warm,
cold, pure, and rich are employed to describe the timbre of a sound. So the
consideration of timbre takes us into the realm of perceptual psychology, where
higher-level processes in the brain are dominant. This is true for other
perceptions of sound, such as music and noise. We shall not delve further into
them; rather, we will concentrate on the question of loudness perception.

A unit called a **phon** is used to express loudness numerically. Phons differ
from decibels because the phon is a unit of loudness perception, whereas the
decibel is a unit of physical intensity. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows the
relationship of loudness to intensity (or intensity level) and frequency for
persons with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-loudness curves. Each
curve is labeled with its loudness in phons. Any sound along a given curve will
be perceived as equally loud by the average person. The curves were determined
by having large numbers of people compare the loudness of sounds at different
frequencies and sound intensity levels. At a frequency of 1000 Hz, phons are
taken to be numerically equal to decibels. The following example helps
illustrate how to use the graph:

![A graph of variation of sound level versus frequency is shown. The sound level is along Y axis and frequency is along X axis. There are thirteen curves each for some count on phons from zero to one hundred and twenty with an interval of ten. The graphs are similar in shape but rising in value with increase in phons. The graph has an initial fall from maximum value on Y axis reaches a minimum and then there is a wavy rise.](../resources/Figure_17_06_02.jpg 'The relationship of loudness in phons to intensity level (in decibels) and intensity (in watts per meter squared) for persons with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-loudness curves—all sounds on a given curve are perceived as equally loud. Phons and decibels are defined to be the same at 1000 Hz.')

Measuring Loudness: Loudness Versus Intensity Level and Frequency
</div>
(a) What is the loudness in phons of a 100-Hz sound that has an intensity level of 80 dB? (b) What is the intensity level in decibels of a 4000-Hz sound having a loudness of 70 phons? (c) At what intensity level will an 8000-Hz sound have the same loudness as a 200-Hz sound at 60 dB?

**Strategy for (a)**

The graph in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) should be referenced in order to solve this
example. To find the loudness of a given sound, you must know its frequency and
intensity level and locate that point on the square grid, then interpolate
between loudness curves to get the loudness in phons.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Identify knowns:

- The square grid of the graph relating phons and decibels is a plot of
  intensity level versus frequency—both physical quantities.
- 100 Hz at 80 dB lies halfway between the curves marked 70 and 80 phons.

(2) Find the loudness: 75 phons.

**Strategy for (b)**

The graph in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) should be referenced in order to solve this
example. To find the intensity level of a sound, you must have its frequency and
loudness. Once that point is located, the intensity level can be determined from
the vertical axis.

**Solution for (b)**

(1) Identify knowns:

- Values are given to be 4000 Hz at 70 phons.

(2) Follow the 70-phon curve until it reaches 4000 Hz. At that point, it is
below the 70 dB line at about 67 dB.

(3) Find the intensity level:

67 dB

**Strategy for (c)**

The graph in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) should be referenced in order to solve this
example.

**Solution for (c)**

(1) Locate the point for a 200 Hz and 60 dB sound.

(2) Find the loudness: This point lies just slightly above the 50-phon curve,
and so its loudness is 51 phons.

(3) Look for the 51-phon level is at 8000 Hz: 63 dB.

**Discussion**

These answers, like all information extracted from [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), have
uncertainties of several phons or several decibels, partly due to difficulties
in interpolation, but mostly related to uncertainties in the equal-loudness
curves.

</div>

Further examination of the graph in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) reveals some
interesting facts about human hearing. First, sounds below the 0-phon curve are
not perceived by most people. So, for example, a 60 Hz sound at 40 dB is
inaudible. The 0-phon curve represents the threshold of normal hearing. We can
hear some sounds at intensity levels below 0 dB. For example, a 3-dB, 5000-Hz
sound is audible, because it lies above the 0-phon curve. The loudness curves
all have dips in them between about 2000 and 5000 Hz. These dips mean the ear is
most sensitive to frequencies in that range. For example, a 15-dB sound at 4000
Hz has a loudness of 20 phons, the same as a 20-dB sound at 1000 Hz. The curves
rise at both extremes of the frequency range, indicating that a
greater-intensity level sound is needed at those frequencies to be perceived to
be as loud as at middle frequencies. For example, a sound at 10 000 Hz must have
an intensity level of 30 dB to seem as loud as a 20 dB sound at 1000 Hz. Sounds
above 120 phons are painful as well as damaging.

We do not often utilize our full range of hearing. This is particularly true for
frequencies above 8000 Hz, which are rare in the environment and are unnecessary
for understanding conversation or appreciating music. In fact, people who have
lost the ability to hear such high frequencies are usually unaware of their loss
until tested. The shaded region in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) is the frequency and
intensity region where most conversational sounds fall. The curved lines
indicate what effect hearing losses of 40 and 60 phons will have. A 40-phon
hearing loss at all frequencies still allows a person to understand
conversation, although it will seem very quiet. A person with a 60-phon loss at
all frequencies will hear only the lowest frequencies and will not be able to
understand speech unless it is much louder than normal. Even so, speech may seem
indistinct, because higher frequencies are not as well perceived. The
conversational speech region also has a gender component, in that female voices
are usually characterized by higher frequencies. So the person with a 60-phon
hearing impediment might have difficulty understanding the normal conversation
of a woman.

![A graph of variation of intensity versus frequency is shown. The intensity in decibel is along Y axis and frequency is along X axis. There are three curves each for some count on phon zero, forty and sixty. The graphs are similar in shape but rising in value with increase in phon. The graph has an initial fall from maximum value on Y axis reaches a minimum and then there is a wavy rise. The conversational speech distribution is shown as a strip across the graph.](../resources/Figure_17_06_03.jpg 'The shaded region represents frequencies and intensity levels found in normal conversational speech. The 0-phon line represents the normal hearing threshold, while those at 40 and 60 represent thresholds for people with 40- and 60-phon hearing losses, respectively.')
{: #Figure3}

Hearing tests are performed over a range of frequencies, usually from 250 to
8000 Hz, and can be displayed graphically in an audiogram like that
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). The hearing threshold is measured in dB _relative to
the normal threshold_, so that normal hearing registers as 0 dB at all
frequencies. Hearing loss caused by noise typically shows a dip near the 4000 Hz
frequency, irrespective of the frequency that caused the loss and often affects
both ears. The most common form of hearing loss comes with age and is called _
presbycusis_—literally elder ear. Such loss is increasingly severe at higher
frequencies, and interferes with music appreciation and speech recognition.

![Three audiogram output graphs of three individuals’ left and right ear are shown. The graph is for hearing threshold level verses frequency in hertz. The hearing threshold level is on Y axis and frequency is along X axis. The first graph has two curve nearly parallel to X axis. The second graph is straight for some range then has a dip at four thousand hertz. The third graph has a falling curve toward X axis from a maximum value on Y axis.](../resources/Figure_17_06_04.jpg 'Audiograms showing the threshold in intensity level versus frequency for three different individuals.

The graph to its right has a dip at 4000 Hz and is that of a child who suffered hearing loss due to a cap gun. The third graph is typical of presbycusis, the progressive loss of higher frequency hearing with age. Tests performed by bone conduction (brackets) can distinguish nerve damage from middle ear damage.')

The Hearing Mechanism
</div>
The hearing mechanism involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that impinges upon our ear is a pressure wave. The ear is a transducer that converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses in a manner much more sophisticated than, but analogous to, a microphone. [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows the gross anatomy of the ear with its division into three parts: the outer ear or ear canal; the middle ear, which runs from the eardrum to the cochlea; and the inner ear, which is the cochlea itself. The body part normally referred to as the ear is technically called the pinna.

![The picture shows the anatomy of a human ear. All organs in the ear are labeled. There is a pinna or the outer end of the ear, followed by a long ear canal in the outer ear. The middle ear has the eardrum little arc shaped. There are small round and oval windows next to it. There are semicircular canals. In the inner ear are snail shell shaped cochlea and cochlea duct. There is a Eustachian tube that leads downward. There are cochlear nerve and vestibular nerves in the inner ear.](../resources/Figure_17_06_05.jpg 'The illustration shows the gross anatomy of the human ear.')
{: #Figure5}

</div>

The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the recessed protected eardrum.
The air column in the ear canal resonates and is partially responsible for the
sensitivity of the ear to sounds in the 2000 to 5000 Hz range. The middle ear
converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the
cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the
eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner
ear via the oval window, creating pressure waves in the cochlea approximately 40
times greater than those impinging on the eardrum. (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).)
Two muscles in the middle ear (not shown) protect the inner ear from very
intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the
force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered
by your own voice, so that humming while shooting a gun, for example, can reduce
noise damage.

![The schematic diagram of the middle ear’s system for converting sound pressure is shown. There is a pressure P one applied on the ear drum shown as a vertical line. The pressure P one travels along a horizontal line marked hammer as force F one. Then up a vertical line marked anvil and reaches a point marked pivot. Then this travels as a force F two along a horizontal line marked stirrup and reaches the oval window shown by a vertical line then passes by it as pressure P two. The pivot point has another support held vertically.](../resources/Figure_17_06_06.jpg 'This schematic shows the middle ear’s system for converting sound pressure into force, increasing that force through a lever system, and applying the increased force to a small area of the cochlea, thereby creating a pressure about 40 times that in the original sound wave. A protective muscle reaction to intense sounds greatly reduces the mechanical advantage of the lever system.')
{: #Figure6}

[[Figure 7]](#Figure7) shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail.
Pressure waves moving through the cochlea cause the tectorial membrane to
vibrate, rubbing cilia (called hair cells), which stimulate nerves that send
electrical signals to the brain. The membrane resonates at different positions
for different frequencies, with high frequencies stimulating nerves at the near
end and low frequencies at the far end. The complete operation of the cochlea is
still not understood, but several mechanisms for sending information to the
brain are known to be involved. For sounds below about 1000 Hz, the nerves send
signals at the same frequency as the sound. For frequencies greater than about
1000 Hz, the nerves signal frequency by position. There is a structure to the
cilia, and there are connections between nerve cells that perform signal
processing before information is sent to the brain. Intensity information is
partly indicated by the number of nerve signals and by volleys of signals. The
brain processes the cochlear nerve signals to provide additional information
such as source direction (based on time and intensity comparisons of sounds from
both ears). Higher-level processing produces many nuances, such as music
appreciation.

![Schematic diagram of the middle and inner ear with various parts labeled.](../resources/Figure_17_06_07.jpg 'The inner ear, or cochlea, is a coiled tube about 3 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length if uncoiled. When the oval window is forced inward, as shown, a pressure wave travels through the perilymph in the direction of the arrows, stimulating nerves at the base of cilia in the organ of Corti.')
{: #Figure7}

Hearing losses can occur because of problems in the middle or inner ear.
Conductive losses in the middle ear can be partially overcome by sending sound
vibrations to the cochlea through the skull. Hearing aids for this purpose
usually press against the bone behind the ear, rather than simply amplifying the
sound sent into the ear canal as many hearing aids do. Damage to the nerves in
the cochlea is not repairable, but amplification can partially compensate. There
is a risk that amplification will produce further damage. Another common failure
in the cochlea is damage or loss of the cilia but with nerves remaining
functional. Cochlear implants that stimulate the nerves directly are now
available and widely accepted. Over 100 000 implants are in use, in about equal
numbers of adults and children.

The cochlear implant was pioneered in Melbourne, Australia, by Graeme Clark in
the 1970s for his deaf father. The implant consists of three external components
and two internal components. The external components are a microphone for
picking up sound and converting it into an electrical signal, a speech processor
to select certain frequencies and a transmitter to transfer the signal to the
internal components through electromagnetic induction. The internal components
consist of a receiver/transmitter secured in the bone beneath the skin, which
converts the signals into electric impulses and sends them through an internal
cable to the cochlea and an array of about 24 electrodes wound through the
cochlea. These electrodes in turn send the impulses directly into the brain. The
electrodes basically emulate the cilia.

The factor of  $$ 10^{-12} $$
 in the range of intensities to which the ear can respond, from threshold to that causing damage after brief exposure, is truly remarkable. If you could measure distances over the same range with a single instrument and the smallest distance you could measure was 1 mm, what would the largest be?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The human ear can respond to sound intensities ranging from the threshold of hearing at $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m² to intensities that cause damage at around $$1$$ W/m², representing a factor of $$10^{12}$$. To find the largest measurable distance, we need to multiply the smallest measurable distance by this same factor of $$10^{12}$$.

**Solution**

Starting with the smallest distance:

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{min}} = 1 \text{ mm} = 1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$$
</div>

The range factor is $$10^{12}$$, so the largest distance is:

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{max}} = d_{\text{min}} \times 10^{12} = (1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}) \times 10^{12} = 10^{9} \text{ m}$$
</div>

Converting to kilometers:

<div class="equation">
$$d_{\text{max}} = 10^{9} \text{ m} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{10^{3} \text{ m}} = 10^{6} \text{ km} = 1 \times 10^{6} \text{ km}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result of one million kilometers is truly remarkable and helps us appreciate the extraordinary dynamic range of human hearing. To put this in perspective, this distance is about 2.6 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon (384,000 km), or roughly equivalent to traveling around Earth's equator 25 times! This analogy vividly demonstrates why the logarithmic decibel scale is necessary for measuring sound intensity—the linear range our ears can detect would be impossibly cumbersome to work with using linear scales. The ear's ability to perceive such a vast range of intensities is a testament to the sophisticated biological mechanisms of hearing, involving not only the physical amplification in the middle ear but also the neural processing of signals. This wide dynamic range allows us to hear everything from the faintest whisper to the roar of a jet engine, though prolonged exposure to the upper end of this range causes permanent damage to the delicate hair cells in the cochlea.

The frequencies to which the ear responds vary by a factor of  $$ 10^{3} $$ .
 Suppose the speedometer on your car measured speeds differing by the same factor of  $$ 10^{3} $$ ,
 and the greatest speed it reads is 90.0 mi/h. What would be the slowest nonzero speed it could read?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The human ear responds to frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, which represents a factor of $$\frac{20,000}{20} = 1000 = 10^3$$. For the speedometer to have the same range factor, we divide the maximum speed by $$10^3$$ to find the minimum speed.

**Solution**

Given:
- Maximum speed: $$v_{\text{max}} = 90.0 \text{ mi/h}$$
- Range factor: $$10^3$$

The minimum speed is:

<div class="equation">
$$v_{\text{min}} = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{10^3} = \frac{90.0 \text{ mi/h}}{1000} = 0.0900 \text{ mi/h}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The slowest nonzero speed this speedometer could read would be 0.0900 mi/h, which is extremely slow—less than one-tenth of a mile per hour! To put this in perspective, this is about 132 feet per hour, or roughly 2.2 feet per minute. A typical walking speed is about 3 mi/h, so this minimum measurable speed is about 33 times slower than walking. This analogy helps illustrate why our hearing range is so impressive: just as this speedometer would be impractical (you'd rarely need to measure such slow speeds), having such a wide frequency range allows humans to perceive everything from the deep rumble of thunder (low frequency) to the high-pitched chirping of birds and insects (high frequency). The 1000:1 frequency ratio means our ears can detect three orders of magnitude in frequency, which is crucial for speech recognition, music appreciation, and environmental awareness. Young, healthy ears can typically detect this full range, though age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) progressively reduces sensitivity to higher frequencies, effectively narrowing this range over time.

What are the closest frequencies to 500 Hz that an average person can clearly distinguish as being different in frequency from 500 Hz? The sounds are not present simultaneously.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

According to the text, humans can discriminate between two sounds if their frequencies differ by 0.3% or more. This is a measure of our frequency discrimination ability, also called pitch discrimination. We need to find frequencies that are 0.3% different from 500 Hz.

**Solution**

The frequency discrimination threshold is 0.3% of the reference frequency:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta f = 0.003 \times f = 0.003 \times 500 \text{ Hz} = 1.5 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Therefore, the closest distinguishable frequencies are:

Lower frequency:
<div class="equation">
$$f_{\text{lower}} = 500 \text{ Hz} - 1.5 \text{ Hz} = 498.5 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

Upper frequency:
<div class="equation">
$$f_{\text{upper}} = 500 \text{ Hz} + 1.5 \text{ Hz} = 501.5 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The average person can distinguish between 500 Hz and either 498.5 Hz or 501.5 Hz when the sounds are presented sequentially. This remarkable ability to detect a difference of just 1.5 Hz out of 500 Hz (a 0.3% change) demonstrates the acute pitch perception of the human auditory system. This discrimination ability is crucial for music appreciation and speech recognition. In musical terms, this 0.3% threshold is much finer than the smallest interval in Western music—a semitone represents about a 6% frequency difference, which is 20 times larger than our discrimination threshold! This explains why we can easily detect when a musical instrument is slightly out of tune. The ability to discriminate pitch depends on several factors including the listener's age, musical training, and the frequency range being tested. Musicians often have even better pitch discrimination than the average person, sometimes able to detect differences as small as 0.1%. However, this ability generally deteriorates with age, particularly at higher frequencies where presbycusis affects hearing sensitivity. The 0.3% threshold assumes ideal listening conditions and non-fatigued, attentive listeners—in noisy environments or when distracted, pitch discrimination becomes significantly worse.

Can the average person tell that a 2002-Hz sound has a different frequency than a 1999-Hz sound without playing them simultaneously?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To determine if the average person can distinguish between these two frequencies, we need to calculate the percentage difference between them and compare it to the human discrimination threshold of 0.3%. We'll use the average of the two frequencies as the reference.

**Solution**

Given frequencies: $$f_1 = 1999 \text{ Hz}$$ and $$f_2 = 2002 \text{ Hz}$$

The difference in frequency is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta f = f_2 - f_1 = 2002 \text{ Hz} - 1999 \text{ Hz} = 3 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

The average frequency is:
<div class="equation">
$$f_{\text{avg}} = \frac{f_1 + f_2}{2} = \frac{1999 + 2002}{2} = 2000.5 \text{ Hz}$$
</div>

The percentage difference is:
<div class="equation">
$$\text{Percentage difference} = \frac{\Delta f}{f_{\text{avg}}} \times 100\% = \frac{3}{2000.5} \times 100\% = 0.150\%$$
</div>

Since $$0.150\% < 0.3\%$$, the difference is below the threshold.

**Discussion**

No, the average person cannot distinguish between a 2002-Hz sound and a 1999-Hz sound when they are not played simultaneously. The percentage difference of 0.150% is exactly half of the 0.3% discrimination threshold that the average person can detect. This means the frequencies are too close together for most people to perceive as different pitches. However, this result comes with important caveats: (1) Some individuals with exceptional pitch discrimination, particularly trained musicians, might be able to detect this difference. (2) If the two sounds were played simultaneously, the average person would hear beats at a frequency of 3 Hz, which would make the difference obvious even though the individual pitches cannot be distinguished. (3) The 2000-Hz region is near the ear's peak sensitivity range (2000-5000 Hz), where pitch discrimination is generally better than at the frequency extremes. (4) Under ideal laboratory conditions with careful attention and immediate comparison, some individuals might approach this discrimination level. In practical terms, this problem illustrates that our pitch perception has definite limits, which is why musical instruments need only be tuned to within a certain tolerance—differences smaller than about 0.3% are imperceptible to most listeners.

If your radio is producing an average sound intensity level of 85 dB, what is the next lowest sound intensity level that is clearly less intense?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

According to the text, at a given frequency, it is possible to discern differences of about 1 dB, and a change of 3 dB is easily noticed. Therefore, the next clearly distinguishable lower intensity level would be at least 3 dB less than the current level.

**Solution**

Given:
- Current intensity level: $$\beta_1 = 85 \text{ dB}$$
- Minimum clearly noticeable change: $$\Delta \beta = 3 \text{ dB}$$

The next lowest clearly distinguishable intensity level is:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 = \beta_1 - \Delta \beta = 85 \text{ dB} - 3 \text{ dB} = 82 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The next lowest sound intensity level that is clearly less intense than 85 dB is 82 dB. While the average person can detect differences as small as 1 dB under ideal conditions with careful attention, a 3 dB change is considered "easily noticed" without special effort or concentration. This 3 dB difference is significant because it represents a factor of 2 in actual sound intensity (since $$10\log_{10}(2) \approx 3$$ dB). In other words, reducing the volume from 85 dB to 82 dB means the radio is producing approximately half the acoustic power. This is why a 3 dB change is often used as a standard reference in acoustics and audio engineering. From a practical standpoint, 85 dB is at the threshold where prolonged exposure begins to pose a risk for hearing damage—OSHA regulations limit exposure to 85 dB to 8 hours per day. Reducing to 82 dB (half the intensity) provides a small but measurable reduction in hearing damage risk. The ability to perceive a 3 dB change easily is important for everyday activities like adjusting radio volume, evaluating environmental noise levels, and using hearing protection effectively. Most volume controls on audio equipment are designed so that small adjustments produce changes of at least 2-3 dB to ensure perceptible differences.

Can you tell that your roommate turned up the sound on the TV if its average sound intensity level goes from 70 to 73 dB?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to determine if a 3 dB change in sound intensity level is perceptible. According to the text, while differences of about 1 dB can be discerned under ideal conditions, a change of 3 dB is easily noticed.

**Solution**

Given:
- Initial intensity level: $$\beta_1 = 70 \text{ dB}$$
- Final intensity level: $$\beta_2 = 73 \text{ dB}$$
- Change in intensity level: $$\Delta \beta = 73 - 70 = 3 \text{ dB}$$

Since the text states that "a change of 3 dB is easily noticed," yes, you would be able to tell that your roommate turned up the sound.

To understand what this change represents in terms of actual intensity, we can calculate the intensity ratio:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta_2 - \beta_1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right) = 3 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right) = 0.3$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2.0$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Yes, you can easily tell that your roommate turned up the TV sound from 70 dB to 73 dB. This 3 dB increase represents a doubling of the actual sound intensity reaching your ears. While this might seem like a large change physically, perceptually it sounds like a moderate but clearly noticeable increase in volume, not a doubling of loudness. This is because our perception of loudness follows a logarithmic relationship with intensity, which is precisely why the decibel scale uses logarithms. In practical terms, a 3 dB change is exactly the threshold for "easily noticed" changes—you wouldn't need to pay special attention or strain to hear it; the difference would be immediately obvious. This is a common scenario in shared living spaces and illustrates why people can easily detect when others adjust volume settings. For context, 70 dB is comparable to the sound level of a vacuum cleaner or busy traffic, while 73 dB is slightly louder but still well below the levels that cause immediate hearing damage. However, both levels are loud enough that extended exposure (more than 8 hours) could contribute to gradual hearing loss over time. This problem also demonstrates why roommate disputes over TV volume are so common—a seemingly small adjustment on the volume dial can produce an easily perceptible change in sound level!

Based on the graph in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), what is the threshold of hearing in decibels for frequencies of 60, 400, 1000, 4000, and 15 000 Hz? Note that many AC electrical appliances produce 60 Hz, music is commonly 400 Hz, a reference frequency is 1000 Hz, your maximum sensitivity is near 4000 Hz, and many older TVs produce a 15 750 Hz whine.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The threshold of hearing is represented by the 0-phon curve in Figure 2. We need to locate each frequency on the horizontal axis, follow it up to where it intersects the 0-phon curve, then read the corresponding intensity level from the vertical axis. The 0-phon curve shows the minimum intensity level required for a sound to be just barely audible at each frequency.

**Solution**

Reading from the 0-phon curve in Figure 2 for each frequency:

- At 60 Hz: approximately **48 dB**
- At 400 Hz: approximately **9 dB**
- At 1000 Hz: **0 dB** (by definition, phons equal decibels at 1000 Hz)
- At 4000 Hz: approximately **–7 dB**
- At 15,000 Hz: approximately **20 dB**

**Discussion**

These threshold values reveal fascinating characteristics of human hearing sensitivity across the frequency spectrum. The ear is least sensitive at very low frequencies (60 Hz requires 48 dB to be audible) and at very high frequencies (15,000 Hz requires 20 dB). Maximum sensitivity occurs around 3000-4000 Hz, where sounds can be detected at intensity levels below 0 dB (negative decibel values relative to the reference $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m²). The –7 dB threshold at 4000 Hz means the ear can detect sounds at this frequency when they are only one-fifth the intensity of the reference threshold ($$10^{-0.7} \approx 0.2$$).

This frequency-dependent sensitivity has important practical implications: (1) The low sensitivity at 60 Hz explains why the hum from AC electrical appliances is often inaudible unless quite loud—the ear simply isn't very sensitive to this frequency. (2) The high sensitivity around 400 Hz (requiring only 9 dB) is ideal for music and speech, which contain significant energy in this range. (3) The peak sensitivity near 4000 Hz is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that enhances our ability to hear warning sounds and human speech, particularly consonants which carry critical information for understanding language. (4) The reduced sensitivity at 15,000 Hz (requiring 20 dB) partially explains why age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) at high frequencies often goes unnoticed—we don't use this range much in daily life. (5) The fact that older TVs produce a 15,750 Hz whine is particularly annoying to young people who can hear it, but older adults with presbycusis are often blissfully unaware of this irritating sound!

What sound intensity levels must sounds of frequencies 60, 3000, and 8000 Hz have in order to have the same loudness as a 40-dB sound of frequency 1000 Hz (that is, to have a loudness of 40 phons)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find sound intensity levels that have the same loudness as a 40-dB sound at 1000 Hz, we need to find where the 40-phon equal-loudness curve intersects each of the specified frequencies (60, 3000, and 8000 Hz) on Figure 2. At 1000 Hz, phons and decibels are defined to be equal, so a 40-dB sound has a loudness of 40 phons.

**Solution**

Since a 40-dB sound at 1000 Hz has a loudness of 40 phons, we need to follow the 40-phon curve in Figure 2 and read the intensity level at each frequency:

- At 60 Hz: The 40-phon curve intersects at approximately **70 dB**
- At 3000 Hz: The 40-phon curve intersects at approximately **37 dB**
- At 8000 Hz: The 40-phon curve intersects at approximately **43 dB**

**Discussion**

These values demonstrate the remarkable frequency-dependent nature of loudness perception. To sound equally loud to a 40-dB tone at 1000 Hz, a 60-Hz tone must be 30 dB more intense (70 dB vs. 40 dB), which represents a factor of $$10^{3} = 1000$$ times more intensity! This occurs because the ear is far less sensitive to low frequencies. Conversely, at 3000 Hz (near the ear's peak sensitivity), a sound needs only 37 dB to achieve the same perceived loudness—3 dB less than the reference, meaning about half the intensity. At 8000 Hz, 43 dB is required, slightly more than the reference.

This frequency dependence has crucial practical applications in audio engineering and hearing protection. Sound systems must compensate for this non-uniform sensitivity through equalization, boosting low frequencies to achieve balanced perceived loudness across the spectrum. This is why bass controls exist on audio equipment and why "loudness" buttons on older stereos would boost bass at low volumes—to compensate for the ear's reduced sensitivity to low frequencies at lower overall sound levels. For hearing conservation, this explains why low-frequency industrial noise (like heavy machinery rumble) may be perceived as less loud than it actually is, potentially leading to underestimation of hearing damage risk. Workers might not realize that a 70-dB, 60-Hz sound, while seeming only moderately loud, actually carries far more acoustic energy than its perceived loudness suggests. Similarly, this is why subwoofers in home theater systems require much more power than mid-range or high-frequency speakers to achieve balanced sound—the ear's insensitivity to low frequencies must be overcome by higher actual sound intensities.

What is the approximate sound intensity level in decibels of a 600-Hz tone if it has a loudness of 20 phons? If it has a loudness of 70 phons?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the intensity level in decibels for a given loudness in phons, we use Figure 2. We locate the appropriate equal-loudness curve (the phon value), find where it intersects the frequency of interest (600 Hz), and read the corresponding intensity level in decibels from the vertical axis.

**Solution**

For part (a): Loudness of 20 phons at 600 Hz

Following the 20-phon curve to where it intersects 600 Hz, we read from the vertical axis:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta \approx 23 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

For part (b): Loudness of 70 phons at 600 Hz

Following the 70-phon curve to where it intersects 600 Hz, we read from the vertical axis:

<div class="equation">
$$\beta \approx 70 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The results reveal an interesting characteristic of the equal-loudness curves. At 20 phons, the 600-Hz tone requires 23 dB—about 3 dB more than the 20 dB that would be required at the reference frequency of 1000 Hz. This difference occurs because 600 Hz is away from the region of maximum ear sensitivity (2000-5000 Hz), though not dramatically so. The ear is slightly less sensitive at 600 Hz than at 1000 Hz for low-intensity sounds.

However, at 70 phons, the intensity level at 600 Hz is essentially the same as it would be at 1000 Hz (70 dB). This demonstrates that the equal-loudness curves become progressively flatter at higher sound levels—the ear's frequency-dependent sensitivity becomes less pronounced for louder sounds. At very high intensity levels, the perceived loudness becomes more uniform across frequencies.

This has practical implications for audio systems: at low volumes (like background music), the frequency response must be carefully equalized to account for the ear's varying sensitivity, which is why many audio receivers have a "loudness" compensation feature that boosts bass and treble at low volumes. At high volumes, less equalization is needed because the ear's response is more uniform. Additionally, this explains why quiet sounds seem to have less bass and treble compared to loud sounds playing the same content—it's not the sound that changes, but our perception of it. This phenomenon is also relevant for hearing tests, where threshold measurements must be made at different frequencies to create a complete audiogram, as demonstrated in Figure 4. The flattening of curves at higher levels also means that hearing damage risk is more uniform across frequencies at dangerous sound levels (above 85 dB).

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the loudness in phons for a given frequency and intensity level, we use Figure 2 in reverse from previous problems. We locate each frequency on the horizontal axis, go up to the given intensity level (in dB) on the vertical axis, and determine which equal-loudness curve (phon value) passes through that point.

**Solution**

**(a) At 60.0-dB intensity level:**

For each frequency, we locate where 60 dB intersects the frequency and interpolate between phon curves:

- **200 Hz**: approximately **50 phons** (below the 60-phon curve)
- **1000 Hz**: **60 phons** (by definition, phons equal dB at 1000 Hz)
- **5000 Hz**: approximately **70 phons** (above the 60-phon curve)
- **10,000 Hz**: approximately **60 phons** (approximately on the 60-phon curve)

**(b) At 110-dB intensity level:**

For each frequency at this high intensity level:

- **200 Hz**: approximately **103 phons**
- **1000 Hz**: **110 phons**
- **5000 Hz**: approximately **113 phons**
- **10,000 Hz**: approximately **108 phons**

**(c) At 20.0-dB intensity level:**

For each frequency at this low intensity level:

- **200 Hz**: approximately **10 phons** (well below the 20-phon curve)
- **1000 Hz**: **20 phons**
- **5000 Hz**: approximately **28 phons** (above the 20-phon curve)
- **10,000 Hz**: approximately **15 phons**

**Discussion**

These results beautifully illustrate how loudness perception varies dramatically with frequency, especially at lower intensity levels. In part (a), even though all four sounds have the same physical intensity (60 dB), they sound quite different: the 5000-Hz tone sounds loudest (70 phons) because it's near the ear's peak sensitivity, while the 200-Hz tone sounds noticeably quieter (50 phons)—a difference of 20 phons represents a very substantial perceptual difference.

Part (c) shows this effect is most pronounced at low intensities. At 20 dB, the loudness varies from 10 phons (200 Hz) to 28 phons (5000 Hz)—the 5000-Hz tone sounds nearly three times as loud despite having identical intensity! This is why soft background music often seems to lack bass—the low frequencies simply don't sound as loud to our ears.

Part (b) reveals that at very high intensity levels (110 dB), the variation in perceived loudness becomes much smaller. All frequencies sound more similar because the equal-loudness curves flatten out considerably at high intensities. This flattening means our ears become less discriminatory about frequency at high sound levels.

This phenomenon has critical implications: (1) In hearing conservation, a 60-dB, 200-Hz sound might be underestimated as a hazard because it sounds less loud than a 60-dB, 5000-Hz sound, even though both carry equal energy. (2) For hearing aid design, frequency-specific amplification must account for these variations—simply amplifying all frequencies equally doesn't restore normal loudness perception. (3) In audio mixing and mastering, engineers must carefully balance frequency content because listeners will perceive different frequencies as having different loudness even when they measure the same dB level. (4) Age-related hearing loss exacerbates these effects, as high-frequency sensitivity declines, making sounds at 5000-10,000 Hz seem even quieter relative to mid-range frequencies.

Suppose a person has a 50-dB hearing loss at all frequencies. By how many factors of 10 will low-intensity sounds need to be amplified to seem normal to this person? Note that smaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further hearing damage.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A 50-dB hearing loss means the person's hearing threshold is 50 dB higher than normal. To determine the intensity amplification needed, we use the relationship between decibels and intensity ratio: $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$. We need to find how many factors of 10 in intensity correspond to a 50-dB increase.

**Solution**

A change in sound level is related to the intensity ratio by:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

For a 50-dB increase:

<div class="equation">
$$50 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

Dividing both sides by 10:

<div class="equation">
$$5 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\right)$$
</div>

Converting from logarithmic form:

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^5$$
</div>

Therefore, the intensity must be amplified by **five factors of 10**, or 100,000 times.

**Discussion**

Low-intensity sounds must be amplified by five factors of 10 (100,000 times in intensity) for this person to perceive them as a person with normal hearing would. This dramatic amplification is necessary because a 50-dB hearing loss represents a very significant impairment—this person's threshold of hearing is 100,000 times less sensitive than normal. In practical terms, sounds that are barely audible to a person with normal hearing would be completely inaudible to this person without amplification.

This level of hearing loss has profound implications for hearing aid design and daily life. Modern hearing aids must provide sophisticated, frequency-specific amplification while avoiding several critical problems: (1) **Preventing further damage**: As noted in the problem, smaller amplification is needed for already-intense sounds. A sound at 90 dB (already potentially damaging) should not be amplified to 140 dB (which would cause immediate, severe damage). This requires compression circuitry that provides more gain for quiet sounds and less for loud sounds. (2) **Preserving dynamic range**: The ear's remarkable ability to hear intensities ranging over 12 orders of magnitude ($$10^{12}$$) must be compressed into the reduced dynamic range of the hearing-impaired ear. (3) **Avoiding feedback**: Amplifying sounds by 100,000 times creates serious challenges with acoustic feedback (the squealing sound when hearing aids malfunction).

A 50-dB hearing loss at all frequencies would severely impact quality of life. Normal conversation (about 60 dB) would be barely audible without amplification. This person would likely qualify for cochlear implant consideration, as conventional hearing aids may provide limited benefit at this severity of loss. The uniform 50-dB loss across all frequencies is actually somewhat unusual—most hearing loss is frequency-dependent, with high frequencies typically affected more severely than low frequencies, particularly in presbycusis and noise-induced hearing loss. The good news is that modern hearing aids with digital signal processing can provide the necessary amplification while minimizing distortion and protecting against further damage, though they cannot fully restore the subtlety and dynamic range of normal hearing.

If a woman needs an amplification of  $$ 5.0 \times 10^{12} $$

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To find the hearing loss in decibels, we need to convert the intensity ratio (amplification factor) to a decibel difference using the formula $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$. The amplification factor tells us by how much the intensity must be increased to bring sounds to her threshold of hearing.

**Solution**

Given that the required amplification is $$5.0 \times 10^{12}$$, we can find the hearing loss using:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{\text{amplified}}}{I_{\text{original}}}\right) = 10\log_{10}(5.0 \times 10^{12})$$

Using logarithm properties:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10[\log_{10}(5.0) + \log_{10}(10^{12})]$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10[\log_{10}(5.0) + 12]$$
</div>

Since $$\log_{10}(5.0) \approx 0.699$$:

<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10[0.699 + 12] = 10 \times 12.699 = 126.99 \approx 127 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This woman has a hearing loss of approximately 127 dB at all frequencies, which represents an extraordinarily severe hearing impairment—essentially total deafness. To put this in perspective, the threshold of pain and immediate hearing damage is around 120 dB, and this woman's hearing threshold is 7 dB beyond that level. This means that sounds would need to be loud enough to cause immediate damage to a normal ear just for her to barely detect them.

This level of hearing loss is classified as profound deafness and has critical implications: (1) **Conventional hearing aids are completely inadequate**: Even the most powerful hearing aids cannot provide enough amplification to be useful, and attempting to do so would create unbearable acoustic feedback. (2) **Cochlear implants are essential**: This woman would be an ideal candidate for cochlear implants, which bypass the damaged hair cells and directly stimulate the auditory nerve. Over 100,000 people worldwide use cochlear implants successfully. (3) **No functional hearing without intervention**: Without cochlear implants or other advanced interventions, this person would rely entirely on visual communication (sign language, lip reading) and vibrotactile sensation.

The note about avoiding amplification above 90 dB is particularly relevant here—it would be medically impossible and dangerous to try to amplify sounds by $$5.0 \times 10^{12}$$ times across all sound levels. For example, a normal conversation at 60 dB would need to be amplified to $$60 + 127 = 187$$ dB, which would cause catastrophic damage to any remaining hearing function and physical damage to the ear. This is why modern hearing technology for profound hearing loss focuses on cochlear implants that work entirely differently from amplification-based hearing aids.

Such profound hearing loss could result from various causes: severe genetic conditions, certain medications (ototoxic drugs), profound noise trauma, infections like meningitis, or other damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve. The measurement of 127 dB hearing loss would typically be determined through bone conduction testing to distinguish cochlear damage from middle ear problems. Remarkably, with cochlear implants, many individuals with this level of hearing loss can develop functional hearing and even participate in telephone conversations, demonstrating the impressive capabilities of modern medical technology in addressing profound sensory deficits.

**Strategy**

A just barely audible sound corresponds to the threshold of hearing, which is the 0-phon curve in Figure 2.

**Solution**

**(a) For 200 Hz:**

From Figure 2, the 0-phon curve at 200 Hz corresponds to approximately 20 dB.

Using the decibel formula:
<div class="equation">
$$\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$20 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$

Rounding to one significant figure: $$I \approx 2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ W/m}^2$$

**(b) For 4000 Hz:**

From Figure 2, the 0-phon curve at 4000 Hz corresponds to approximately –7 dB (below the reference).

<div class="equation">
$$-7 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$-0.7 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$

$$\frac{I}{10^{-12}} = 10^{-0.7} \approx 0.2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 0.2 \times 10^{-12} = 2 \times 10^{-13} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The intensity of a just barely audible 200-Hz sound is approximately $$2 \times 10^{-10}$$ W/m², while a barely audible 4000-Hz sound has an intensity of only $$2 \times 10^{-13}$$ W/m². This remarkable difference—the 200-Hz sound requires about 1000 times more intensity than the 4000-Hz sound to be detected—demonstrates the ear's dramatically different sensitivity across the frequency spectrum.

At 4000 Hz, near the ear's peak sensitivity, sounds can be detected at intensities below the reference threshold $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m². This is why $$I_0$$ is often called the "threshold of hearing at 1000 Hz"—it's not a universal threshold but rather a reference point. At the ear's most sensitive frequencies (around 3000-4000 Hz), we can actually hear sounds quieter than this reference.

To appreciate how tiny these intensities are, consider that $$2 \times 10^{-13}$$ W/m² for the 4000-Hz sound is an incredibly small amount of energy. If this intensity were spread over the area of a typical eardrum (about $$5 \times 10^{-5}$$ m²), the total power reaching the eardrum would be only $$10^{-17}$$ watts—ten million trillion times smaller than a 1-watt light bulb! This extraordinary sensitivity is possible because of the sophisticated amplification mechanisms in the middle ear (the lever system of the ossicles provides about 40× pressure amplification) and the remarkable sensitivity of the hair cells in the cochlea.

The frequency-dependent threshold has evolutionary significance: the 3000-5000 Hz range, where hearing is most sensitive, corresponds to the frequency range of many warning sounds in nature and is crucial for speech comprehension, particularly for consonants. The reduced sensitivity at 200 Hz (a low frequency) means we're less distracted by low-frequency environmental sounds like distant thunder or wind, which carry little informational value. This frequency-selective sensitivity has been fine-tuned over millions of years of evolution to optimize our survival and communication capabilities.

To find the intensity for a given loudness in phons, we first use Figure 2 to find the intensity level in decibels by locating where the specified phon curve intersects the given frequency. Then we convert from decibels to intensity using $$\beta = 10\log_{10}(I/I_0)$$ where $$I_0 = 10^{-12}$$ W/m².

**Solution**

**(a) For 60.0-Hz sound at 60 phons:**

From Figure 2, the 60-phon curve at 60 Hz corresponds to approximately 82 dB.

Using the decibel formula:
<div class="equation">
$$82 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$8.2 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I}{10^{-12}} = 10^{8.2} \approx 1.58 \times 10^{8}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 1.58 \times 10^{8} \times 10^{-12} = 1.58 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/m}^2 \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**(b) For 10,000-Hz sound at 60 phons:**

From Figure 2, the 60-phon curve at 10,000 Hz corresponds to approximately 60 dB (the curves are flatter in this region).

<div class="equation">
$$60 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$6.0 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I}{10^{-12}} = 10^{6}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$I = 10^{6} \times 10^{-12} = 10^{-6} \text{ W/m}^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ W/m}^2$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The results show that to achieve the same perceived loudness of 60 phons, the 60-Hz sound must have an intensity of approximately $$1.6 \times 10^{-4}$$ W/m², while the 10,000-Hz sound needs only $$1.0 \times 10^{-6}$$ W/m². This means the low-frequency sound requires about 160 times more intensity to sound equally loud! This dramatic difference (22 dB) illustrates why low-frequency sounds need much more power to be perceived as equally loud as mid- to high-frequency sounds.

This has profound implications for sound system design and energy consumption. Subwoofers that reproduce low-frequency sounds must handle far more power than tweeters (high-frequency speakers) to achieve balanced perceived volume across the frequency spectrum. A home theater system might use a 200-watt subwoofer alongside 50-watt mid-range and tweeter speakers precisely because of this frequency-dependent sensitivity.

From a physiological perspective, this difference arises from several factors: (1) The ear canal resonates at frequencies around 2000-4000 Hz, naturally amplifying those frequencies. (2) The ossicular chain (hammer, anvil, stirrup) in the middle ear is most efficient at transferring mid-frequency vibrations. (3) The basilar membrane in the cochlea has frequency-dependent mechanical properties that favor mid-range frequencies. (4) Low-frequency sounds have longer wavelengths that don't couple as efficiently to the small structures of the inner ear.

For hearing protection, this means that low-frequency industrial noise at 60 Hz might not seem dangerously loud even when it carries substantial acoustic power. A 82-dB sound at 60 Hz (which sounds moderately loud, like 60 phons) is approaching the threshold where extended exposure begins to pose hearing damage risk, yet it might be underestimated because it doesn't sound as loud as its 82-dB intensity level might suggest if it were at a higher frequency. Conversely, at 10,000 Hz, the ear's reduced sensitivity at high frequencies (compared to its peak at 3000-4000 Hz) means that age-related hearing loss, which typically affects high frequencies first, will make these sounds seem even quieter as people age.

A person has a hearing threshold 10 dB above normal at 100 Hz and 50 dB above normal at 4000 Hz. How much more intense must a 100-Hz tone be than a 4000-Hz tone if they are both barely audible to this person?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the intensity ratio between the two barely audible tones. First, we'll determine the normal thresholds at each frequency from Figure 2, then add the person's hearing loss to find their actual thresholds. Finally, we'll calculate the ratio of intensities at these two threshold levels.

**Solution**

From Figure 2, the normal hearing thresholds (0-phon curve) are:
- At 100 Hz: approximately 38 dB
- At 4000 Hz: approximately –7 dB

For this person with hearing loss:
- Threshold at 100 Hz: $$38 + 10 = 48 \text{ dB}$$
- Threshold at 4000 Hz: $$-7 + 50 = 43 \text{ dB}$$

The difference in threshold levels is:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 48 - 43 = 5 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

To find the intensity ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{100}}{I_{4000}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$5 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{100}}{I_{4000}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$0.5 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{100}}{I_{4000}}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_{100}}{I_{4000}} = 10^{0.5} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16$$
</div>

Rounding to 2 significant figures: $$\frac{I_{100}}{I_{4000}} \approx 2.5$$

**Discussion**

The 100-Hz tone must be about 2.5 times more intense than the 4000-Hz tone for both to be barely audible to this person. At first glance, this result might seem counterintuitive—the person has much greater hearing loss at 4000 Hz (50 dB) than at 100 Hz (10 dB), yet the 100-Hz tone needs to be more intense. This apparent paradox is explained by the normal ear's frequency-dependent sensitivity.

For a person with normal hearing, a 100-Hz tone needs to be much more intense than a 4000-Hz tone to be audible (38 dB vs. –7 dB, a difference of 45 dB). This person's hearing loss partially "compensates" for this normal frequency dependence. The 10-dB loss at 100 Hz brings their threshold to 48 dB, while the 50-dB loss at 4000 Hz brings that threshold to 43 dB. The net result is that the person's thresholds are now only 5 dB apart, compared to 45 dB apart for normal hearing.

This problem illustrates an important concept in audiology: **the pattern of hearing loss matters as much as the magnitude**. This person's hearing loss pattern is typical of **noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)**, which characteristically causes a pronounced dip in sensitivity around 3000-6000 Hz, with the worst loss typically at 4000 Hz. This distinctive "4000-Hz notch" on an audiogram is a hallmark of noise exposure from sources like gunfire, power tools, or loud music. The 10-dB loss at 100 Hz represents mild hearing loss, while the 50-dB loss at 4000 Hz represents moderate to severe hearing loss.

The clinical implications are significant: (1) This person would have particular difficulty understanding speech, because consonant sounds (which carry much of speech's intelligibility) fall in the 2000-8000 Hz range where their hearing is most impaired. (2) They might not notice their hearing problem in quiet environments, because the low-frequency vowel sounds would still be audible. (3) A hearing aid would need to provide frequency-specific amplification—much more gain at 4000 Hz than at 100 Hz. (4) This hearing loss pattern is often preventable through proper hearing protection in noisy environments. The fact that noise-induced hearing loss shows up first around 4000 Hz is thought to be related to the mechanical properties of the cochlea and the specific resonances in the ear canal. Unfortunately, hair cell damage at this frequency is permanent and irreversible, emphasizing the critical importance of hearing protection in occupational and recreational settings with high noise levels.

A child has a hearing loss of 60 dB near 5000 Hz, due to noise exposure, and normal hearing elsewhere. How much more intense is a 5000-Hz tone than a 400-Hz tone if they are both barely audible to the child?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to find the intensity ratio between barely audible tones at 5000 Hz and 400 Hz for this child. First, we determine the normal thresholds at each frequency from Figure 2. The child has normal hearing at 400 Hz but a 60-dB loss at 5000 Hz, so we add 60 dB to the normal threshold at 5000 Hz to find the child's threshold there. Then we calculate the intensity ratio.

**Solution**

From Figure 2, the normal hearing thresholds (0-phon curve) are:
- At 400 Hz: approximately 9 dB
- At 5000 Hz: approximately –5 dB (near the ear's peak sensitivity)

For this child:
- Threshold at 400 Hz: **9 dB** (normal hearing)
- Threshold at 5000 Hz: $$-5 + 60 = 55 \text{ dB}$$ (with 60-dB loss)

The difference in threshold levels is:

$$\Delta\beta = 55 - 9 = 46 \text{ dB}$$

To find the intensity ratio:

$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{5000}}{I_{400}}\right)$$

Rounding to 2 significant figures: $$\frac{I_{5000}}{I_{400}} \approx 4.0 \times 10^{4}$$

**Discussion**

The 5000-Hz tone must be approximately 40,000 times more intense than the 400-Hz tone for both to be barely audible to this child! This dramatic result illustrates the devastating impact of noise-induced hearing loss on a young person. For a child with normal hearing, a 5000-Hz tone would actually need to be *less* intense than a 400-Hz tone to be equally audible (because 5000 Hz is near the ear's peak sensitivity). But this child's 60-dB hearing loss at 5000 Hz completely reverses this relationship.

This scenario is tragically realistic and increasingly common. The most likely source of such severe, frequency-specific hearing loss in a child is acoustic trauma from a single very loud impulse noise—exactly as suggested by the mention of "noise exposure" in Figure 4's caption about "a child who suffered hearing loss due to a cap gun." Cap guns, firecrackers, and firearms can produce peak sound levels of 140-170 dB, well above the threshold for immediate permanent damage. A single exposure to such a loud impulse can destroy hair cells in the region of the cochlea that responds to frequencies around 4000-6000 Hz, creating the characteristic "noise notch" seen in this child's hearing.

The implications for this child are serious and permanent: (1) **Speech comprehension difficulties**: Many consonant sounds crucial for understanding speech (like 's', 'f', 'th', 'sh') fall in the 4000-8000 Hz range where the child has severe loss. The child might hear that someone is speaking but struggle to understand the words, especially in noisy environments like classrooms. (2) **Educational impact**: This hearing loss can significantly affect learning, particularly in reading and language development. Early intervention with appropriate hearing aids and possible educational support services is crucial. (3) **Irreversibility**: The damaged hair cells cannot regenerate; this hearing loss is permanent. (4) **Prevention is critical**: This tragedy was entirely preventable through proper supervision and hearing protection.

From a public health perspective, this problem highlights why organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend against children using cap guns and similar toys, and why hearing protection is essential when children are exposed to loud sounds. The problem also mentions this is "due to noise exposure" and occurs "near 5000 Hz"—this frequency-specific damage is a hallmark of acoustic trauma and differs markedly from the more gradual, high-frequency losses seen in presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) or the broader-spectrum losses from genetic conditions. The good news is that modern digital hearing aids can provide frequency-specific amplification, giving substantial boost at 5000 Hz while providing minimal amplification at 400 Hz where hearing remains normal, though they cannot fully restore the loss.

What is the ratio of intensities of two sounds of identical frequency if the first is just barely discernible as louder to a person than the second?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

According to the text, at a given frequency, it is possible to discern differences of about 1 dB in sound intensity level. This represents the just-noticeable difference (JND) in loudness. We need to find what intensity ratio corresponds to a 1-dB difference in sound level.

**Solution**

For the minimum discernible difference in loudness:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 1 \text{ dB}$$
</div>

Using the relationship between decibel difference and intensity ratio:
<div class="equation">
$$\Delta\beta = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_1}{I_2}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$1 = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_1}{I_2}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$0.1 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_1}{I_2}\right)$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$\frac{I_1}{I_2} = 10^{0.1} \approx 1.259 \approx 1.26$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The ratio of intensities is approximately 1.26, meaning the louder sound must be about 26% more intense than the quieter sound for a person to just barely detect the difference. This surprisingly small ratio demonstrates the remarkable sensitivity of human hearing to changes in sound intensity. An increase of just 26% in intensity—corresponding to 1 dB—is perceptible under ideal listening conditions with careful attention.

This just-noticeable difference (JND) is a fundamental concept in psychoacoustics and has important practical applications: (1) **Audio equipment design**: High-quality volume controls are designed to provide steps smaller than 1 dB to allow for smooth, nearly continuous adjustment. Controls with larger steps (2-3 dB) make it difficult to find the "just right" volume level. (2) **Sound level regulations**: Occupational safety standards often specify sound limits in whole decibels because differences smaller than 1 dB are difficult to measure reliably and may not be perceptually significant. (3) **Acoustic treatment**: In architectural acoustics, modifications that reduce sound levels by less than 1 dB are generally not worth the cost, as they won't be noticed.

It's important to note that the 1-dB JND represents optimal conditions. The text states that "a change of 3 dB is easily noticed," implying that 1 dB requires attentive listening. In everyday situations with background noise or divided attention, the practical JND is often closer to 2-3 dB. Additionally, the JND can vary slightly with frequency and absolute sound level—our discrimination ability is generally best at moderate sound levels in the mid-frequency range.

The mathematical form of this relationship shows that loudness perception follows Weber's Law, a general principle in psychophysics stating that the JND is proportional to the stimulus magnitude. In the case of hearing, because we perceive logarithmically, a constant ratio of intensities (1.26:1) produces a constant perceptual difference (1 dB) regardless of the absolute intensity levels. This is why the decibel scale works so well for describing sound—it matches how our hearing system actually processes intensity information. The factor of 1.26 might seem arbitrary, but it emerges naturally from the base-10 logarithm and the definition of the decibel (one-tenth of a Bel). If we used natural logarithms instead, we'd get different numbers, but the underlying perceptual relationship would be the same.
