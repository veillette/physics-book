![Dew drops on a banana leaf.](../resources/Figure_13_06_00.jpg 'Dew drops like these, on a banana leaf photographed just after sunrise, form when the air temperature drops to or below the dew point. At the dew point, the rate at which water molecules join together is greater than the rate at which they separate, and some of the water condenses to form droplets. (credit: Aaron Escobar, Flickr) ')

The expression “it’s not the heat, it’s the humidity” makes a valid point. We
keep cool in hot weather by evaporating sweat from our skin and water from our
breathing passages. Because evaporation is inhibited by high humidity, we feel
hotter at a given temperature when the humidity is high. Low humidity, on the
other hand, can cause discomfort from excessive drying of mucous membranes and
can lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections.

When we say humidity, we really mean **relative humidity**. Relative humidity
tells us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible.
At its maximum, denoted as **saturation**, the relative humidity is 100%, and
evaporation is inhibited. The amount of water vapor in the air depends on
temperature. For example, relative humidity rises in the evening, as air
temperature declines, sometimes reaching the **dew point**. At the dew point
temperature, relative humidity is 100%, and fog may result from the condensation
of water droplets if they are small enough to stay in suspension. Conversely, if
you wish to dry something (perhaps your hair), it is more effective to blow hot
air over it rather than cold air, because, among other things, the increase in
temperature increases the energy of the molecules, so the rate of evaporation
increases.

The amount of water vapor in the air depends on the vapor pressure of water. The
liquid and solid phases are continuously giving off vapor because some of the
molecules have high enough speeds to enter the gas phase;
see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(a). If a lid is placed over the container, as
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(b), evaporation continues, increasing the pressure, until
sufficient vapor has built up for condensation to balance evaporation. Then
equilibrium has been achieved, and the vapor pressure is equal to the partial
pressure of water in the container. Vapor pressure increases with temperature
because molecular speeds are higher as temperature
increases. [[Table 1]](#Table1) gives representative values of water vapor
pressure over a range of temperatures.

![Two containers, each filled two-thirds with water. One is open to the atmosphere and the other is sealed at the top. The water molecules are depicted as circles with vector arrows of different lengths and directions to indicate velocity. In the sealed container the density of molecules in the air above the water is greater than in the unsealed container. In the sealed container, water is condensing along the walls and top of the upper part of the container.](../resources/Figure_13_06_01.jpg '(a) Because of the distribution of speeds and kinetic energies, some water molecules can break away to the vapor phase even at temperatures below the ordinary boiling point. (b) If the container is sealed, evaporation will continue until there is enough vapor density for the condensation rate to equal the evaporation rate. This vapor density and the partial pressure it creates are the saturation values. They increase with temperature and are independent of the presence of other gases, such as air. They depend only on the vapor pressure of water.')

Relative humidity is related to the partial pressure of water vapor in the air.
At 100% humidity, the partial pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, and no
more water can enter the vapor phase. If the partial pressure is less than the
vapor pressure, then evaporation will take place, as humidity is less than 100%.
If the partial pressure is greater than the vapor pressure, condensation takes
place. In everyday language, people sometimes refer to the capacity of air to
“hold” water vapor, but this is not actually what happens. The water vapor is
not held by the air. The amount of water in air is determined by the vapor
pressure of water and has nothing to do with the properties of air.

<div class="title">
Calculating Density Using Vapor Pressure
</div>
[[Table 1]](#Table1) gives the vapor pressure of water at  $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$
 as  $$ 2.33 \times 10^{3}  \text{Pa}\text{.} $$
 Use the ideal gas law to calculate the density of water vapor in  $$\text{g}/{\text{m}}^{3} $$
 that would create a partial pressure equal to this vapor pressure. Compare the result with the saturation vapor density given in the table.

**Strategy**

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two steps. The partial
pressure follows the ideal gas law,

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV= nRT, $$
</div>
where  $$n $$
 is the number of moles. If we solve this equation for  $$n/V $$
 to calculate the number of moles per cubic meter, we can then convert this quantity to grams per cubic meter as requested. To do this, we need to use the molecular mass of water, which is given in the periodic table.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the proper units:

1. temperature $$T=20\text{ºC}=293 \text{K} $$
1. vapor pressure $$P $$ of water at $$20\text{ºC} $$  
   is $$ 2.33 \times 10^{3} \text{Pa} $$
1. molecular mass of water is $$ 18.0 \text{g/mol} $$ { type="a"}

1. Solve the ideal gas law for $$n/V $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{n}{V}=\frac{P}{RT} $$
</div>
3. Substitute known values into the equation and solve for  $$n/V $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{n}{V}=\frac{P}{RT}=\frac{ 2.33 \times 10^{3}  \text{Pa}}{\left( 8.31 \text{J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\right)\left(293 \text{K}\right)}= 0.957 {\text{mol/m}}^{3} $$
</div>
4. Convert the density in moles per cubic meter to grams per cubic meter.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\left( 0.957\frac{\text{mol}}{ {\text{m}}^{3}}\right)\left(\frac{18.0 \text{g}}{\text{mol}}\right)= 17.2 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The density is obtained by assuming a pressure equal to the vapor pressure of
water at $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ . The density found is identical to the value
in [[Table 1]](#Table1), which means that a vapor density of $$ 17.2 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$ at $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ creates a partial pressure of $$ 2.33 \times 10^{3} \text{Pa} \text{,} $$ equal to the vapor pressure of water at that temperature. If the partial pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, then the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium, and the relative humidity is 100%. Thus, there can be no more than 17.2 g of water vapor per $${\text{m}}^{3} $$ at
$$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ , so that this value is the saturation vapor density at that
temperature. This example illustrates how water vapor behaves like an ideal gas:
the pressure and density are consistent with the ideal gas law (assuming the
density in the table is correct). The saturation vapor densities listed
in [[Table 1]](#Table1) are the maximum amounts of water vapor that air can hold
at various temperatures.

</div>

<div class="title">
Percent Relative Humidity
</div>
We define **percent relative humidity** as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density, or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{percent relative humidity}=\frac{\text{vapor density}}{\text{saturation vapor density}}×100 $$
</div>
</div>

We can use this and the data in [[Table 1]](#Table1) to do a variety of
interesting calculations, keeping in mind that relative humidity is based on the
comparison of the partial pressure of water vapor in air and ice.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Humidity and Dew Point
</div>
(a) Calculate the percent relative humidity on a day when the temperature is  $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$
 and the air contains 9.40 g of water vapor per  $${\text{m}}^{3} $$ .
 (b) At what temperature will this air reach 100% relative humidity (the saturation density)? This temperature is the dew point. (c) What is the humidity when the air temperature is  $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$
 and the dew point is  $$ - 10.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy and Solution**

(a) Percent relative humidity is defined as the ratio of vapor density to
saturation vapor density.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{percent relative humidity}=\frac{\text{vapor density}}{\text{saturation vapor density}}×100 $$
</div>
The first is given to be  $$9.40 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$ ,
 and the second is found in [[Table 1]](#Table1) to be  $$23.0 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$ .
 Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{percent relative humidity}=\frac{9.40 {\text{g/m}}^{3}}{23.0 {\text{g/m}}^{3}}×100= 40.9 \text{.%} $$
</div>
(b) The air contains  $$9.40 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$
 of water vapor. The relative humidity will be 100% at a temperature where  $$9.40 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$
 is the saturation density. Inspection of [[Table 1]](#Table1) reveals this to be the case at  $$ 10.0\text{ºC} $$ ,
 where the relative humidity will be 100%. That temperature is called the dew point for air with this concentration of water vapor.

(c) Here, the dew point temperature is given to be $$ - 10.0\text{ºC} $$ .
Using [[Table 1]](#Table1), we see that the vapor density is $$2.36 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$ , because this value is the saturation vapor density at $$ - 10.0\text{ºC} $$ . The saturation vapor density at $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$ is seen to be $$23.0 {\text{g/m}}^{3} $$ . Thus, the relative humidity at $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$ is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{percent relative humidity}=\frac{2.36 {\text{g/m}}^{3}}{23.0 {\text{g/m}}^{3}}×100= 10.3\% \text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The importance of dew point is that air temperature cannot drop below $$ 10.0\text{ºC} $$ in part (b), or $$ - 10.0\text{ºC} $$ in part (c), without
water vapor condensing out of the air. If condensation occurs, considerable
transfer of heat occurs (discussed
in [Heat and Heat Transfer Methods](../contents/ch14HeatAndHeatTransfers))
, which prevents the temperature from further dropping. When dew points are
below $$0\text{ºC} $$ , freezing temperatures are a greater possibility, which
explains why farmers keep track of the dew point. Low humidity in deserts means
low dew-point temperatures. Thus condensation is unlikely. If the temperature
drops, vapor does not condense in liquid drops. Because no heat is released into
the air, the air temperature drops more rapidly compared to air with higher
humidity. Likewise, at high temperatures, liquid droplets do not evaporate, so
that no heat is removed from the gas to the liquid phase. This explains the
large range of temperature in arid regions.

</div>

Why does water boil at $$100\text{ºC} $$ ? You will note
from [[Table 1]](#Table1) that the vapor pressure of water at $$100\text{ºC} $$
is $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5} \text{Pa} $$ , or 1.00 atm. Thus, it can evaporate
without limit at this temperature and pressure. But why does it form bubbles
when it boils? This is because water ordinarily contains significant amounts of
dissolved air and other impurities, which are observed as small bubbles of air
in a glass of water. If a bubble starts out at the bottom of the container at
$$20\text{ºC} $$ , it contains water vapor (about 2.30%). The pressure inside
the bubble is fixed at 1.00 atm (we ignore the slight pressure exerted by the
water around it). As the temperature rises, the amount of air in the bubble
stays the same, but the water vapor increases; the bubble expands to keep the
pressure at 1.00 atm. At $$100\text{ºC} $$ , water vapor enters the bubble
continuously since the partial pressure of water is equal to 1.00 atm in
equilibrium. It cannot reach this pressure, however, since the bubble also
contains air and total pressure is 1.00 atm. The bubble grows in size and
thereby increases the buoyant force. The bubble breaks away and rises rapidly to
the surface—we call this boiling! (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![A beaker of water being heated over a flame. The beaker is shown at three different times. In the first, at twenty degrees C, a small bubble sits on the bottom of the beaker. In the second step, the water temperature is fifty degrees C and the bubble is larger, though still sitting on the bottom of the beaker. In the third step, the water temperature is one hundred degrees C. The bubble is larger and is rising toward the surface.](../resources/Figure_13_06_02.jpg '(a) An air bubble in water starts out saturated with water vapor at ( 20 \\text{ºC} ). (b) As the temperature rises, water vapor enters the bubble because its vapor pressure increases. The bubble expands to keep its pressure at 1.00 atm. (c) At ( 100 \\text{ºC} ), water vapor enters the bubble continuously because water’s vapor pressure exceeds its partial pressure in the bubble, which must be less than 1.00 atm. The bubble grows and rises to the surface. ')

Check Your Understanding

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Freeze drying is a process in which substances, such as foods, are dried by placing them in a vacuum chamber and lowering the atmospheric pressure around them. How does the lowered atmospheric pressure speed the drying process, and why does it cause the temperature of the food to drop?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
Decreased the atmospheric pressure results in decreased partial pressure of water, hence a lower humidity. So evaporation of water from food, for example, will be enhanced. The molecules of water most likely to break away from the food will be those with the greatest velocities. Those remaining thus have a lower average velocity and a lower temperature. This can (and does) result in the freezing and drying of the food; hence the process is aptly named freeze drying.

### Section Summary

- Relative humidity is the fraction of water vapor in a gas compared to the
  saturation value.
- The saturation vapor density can be determined from the vapor pressure for a
  given temperature.
- Percent relative humidity is defined to be

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\text{percent relative humidity}=\frac{\text{vapor density}}{\text{saturation vapor density}}×100 \text{.} $$
  </div>

- The dew point is the temperature at which air reaches 100% relative humidity.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Because humidity depends only on water's vapor pressure and temperature, are the saturation vapor densities listed in [[Table 1]](#Table1) valid in an atmosphere of helium at a pressure of  $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ ,
 rather than air? Are those values affected by altitude on Earth?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the fundamental principles governing vapor pressure and saturation vapor density. These properties depend on the water molecules themselves and their interactions with each other, not on the surrounding gas.

**Solution:**
Yes, the saturation vapor densities listed in Table 1 are valid in an atmosphere of helium at the same pressure. The saturation vapor pressure and density of water depend only on the temperature and the properties of water molecules, not on the composition of the surrounding gas. Water molecules evaporate and condense based on their own kinetic energies and intermolecular forces, regardless of whether the surrounding gas is air, helium, or any other non-reactive gas.

Similarly, these values are not affected by altitude on Earth. While atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the saturation vapor pressure of water at a given temperature remains constant. The saturation vapor density depends only on temperature, not on the total atmospheric pressure.

**Discussion:**
This independence from the surrounding gas is a consequence of Dalton's law of partial pressures. Each gas component behaves independently, creating its own partial pressure. The water vapor will reach saturation when its partial pressure equals the vapor pressure at that temperature, regardless of what other gases are present or what the total pressure is.

Why does a beaker of  $$ 40.0\text{ºC} $$
 water placed in a vacuum chamber start to boil as the chamber is evacuated (air is pumped out of the chamber)? At what pressure does the boiling begin? Would food cook any faster in such a beaker?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider what causes boiling and the relationship between vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure. Use Table 1 to find the vapor pressure of water at 40.0ºC.

**Solution:**
Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. At 40.0ºC, the vapor pressure of water is $$ 7.34 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa (from Table 1). As the chamber is evacuated and the pressure drops, the water begins to boil when the chamber pressure reaches $$ 7.34 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa, which is the vapor pressure of water at 40.0ºC.

Food would **not** cook faster in such a beaker. In fact, it would cook more slowly or not at all. Cooking requires sufficient temperature to break down food molecules and kill bacteria, which typically requires temperatures well above 40.0ºC. Although the water is boiling, it remains at only 40.0ºC, which is far too low for effective cooking.

**Discussion:**
This demonstrates an important distinction between boiling and high temperature. Boiling is simply the transition from liquid to gas when vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and it can occur at any temperature if the pressure is low enough. This is why water boils at lower temperatures at high altitudes, and why pressure cookers can raise the boiling point by increasing pressure.

Why does rubbing alcohol evaporate much more rapidly than water at STP (standard temperature and pressure)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Consider the relationship between vapor pressure and evaporation rate. The rate of evaporation depends on how easily molecules escape from the liquid phase into the gas phase.

**Solution:**
Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) evaporates much more rapidly than water because it has a much higher vapor pressure at the same temperature. At room temperature (about 20ºC), rubbing alcohol has a vapor pressure significantly higher than water's vapor pressure of $$ 2.33 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa.

The higher vapor pressure means that alcohol molecules have weaker intermolecular forces (primarily van der Waals forces) compared to water molecules (which have strong hydrogen bonding). Weaker intermolecular forces mean that alcohol molecules can more easily escape from the liquid surface into the gas phase.

**Discussion:**
This is why rubbing alcohol feels cool when applied to skin—it evaporates rapidly, absorbing heat energy from your skin in the process (latent heat of vaporization). Water also has a cooling effect when it evaporates, but because it evaporates more slowly, the cooling sensation is less immediate. The strong hydrogen bonding in water makes it require more energy for molecules to break free, resulting in slower evaporation and a higher boiling point (100ºC) compared to isopropyl alcohol (82.6ºC).

Dry air is 78.1% nitrogen. What is the partial pressure of nitrogen when the atmospheric pressure is  $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use Dalton's law of partial pressures. The partial pressure of a component gas is the percentage of that gas times the total pressure.

**Solution:**
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{N}_2}= 0.781 \times P_{\text{total}}= 0.781 \times 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 7.89 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
Nitrogen comprises about 78% of the atmosphere by volume (and by partial pressure), making it the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere. This partial pressure of 78,900 Pa (about 0.78 atm) is what determines the concentration of nitrogen dissolved in liquids like blood and water. This is important for scuba divers—at depth, the increased pressure increases nitrogen's partial pressure, causing more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues. If a diver ascends too quickly, this dissolved nitrogen can form bubbles, causing decompression sickness ("the bends").

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Look up the vapor pressure in Table 1. (b) Compare to standard atmospheric pressure. (c) Use the saturation vapor density from Table 1 and compare to the density of dry air.

**Solution:**
(a) From Table 1, the vapor pressure of water at 20.0ºC is $$ 2.33 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa.

(b) Standard atmospheric pressure is $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa. The percentage is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Percentage}=\frac{ 2.33 \times 10^{3}  \text{Pa}}{ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}} \times 100 = 2.31\% $$
</div>

(c) From Table 1, the saturation vapor density at 20.0ºC is 17.2 g/m³ = 0.0172 kg/m³. The total mass of saturated air per cubic meter is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Total mass}= 1.20 \text{ kg/m}^{3}+ 0.0172 \text{ kg/m}^{3}= 1.2172 \text{ kg/m}^{3} $$

The percentage of water vapor is:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Percentage}=\frac{ 0.0172}{ 1.2172} \times 100 = 1.41\% $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
Even at 100% relative humidity, water vapor comprises only a small fraction of air by mass (about 1.4%) and an even smaller fraction by pressure (about 2.3%). This shows that air can hold only a limited amount of water vapor at room temperature. The partial pressure of water vapor is much less than atmospheric pressure, which is why water doesn't spontaneously evaporate into air at normal conditions.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Use Table 1 to find the temperature at which the vapor pressure of water equals the given atmospheric pressures.

**Solution:**
(a) At 1500 m, the atmospheric pressure is $$ 8.59 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa. From Table 1, we see that this vapor pressure corresponds to a temperature of approximately **95ºC**.

(b) At 3000 m, the atmospheric pressure is $$ 7.00 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa. From Table 1, the vapor pressure of $$ 7.01 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa (very close to $$ 7.00 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa) corresponds to a temperature of approximately **90ºC**.

**Discussion:**
As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, and water boils at progressively lower temperatures. This has practical implications for cooking—at high altitudes, water boils at lower temperatures, so food takes longer to cook. This is why cooking instructions often include altitude adjustments, and why pressure cookers are particularly useful in mountainous regions. The 5-10ºC decrease in boiling point at moderate altitudes can significantly affect cooking times.

What is the atmospheric pressure on top of Mt. Everest on a day when water boils there at a temperature of  $$ 70.0\text{ºC}$$ ?
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Find the vapor pressure of water at 70.0ºC from Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the vapor pressure of water at 70ºC is $$ 3.12 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa.

Since water boils when its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, the atmospheric pressure at the top of Mt. Everest on this day is $$ 3.12 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa (about 0.31 atm or 31% of sea-level pressure).

**Discussion:**
This atmospheric pressure of about 31,200 Pa is typical for the summit of Mt. Everest (8,849 m above sea level), where the pressure is roughly one-third of sea-level pressure. At this pressure, water boils at only 70ºC instead of the normal 100ºC, making it very difficult to cook food properly. This reduced boiling point is one of many challenges faced by mountain climbers at extreme altitudes. The low atmospheric pressure also means climbers receive less oxygen with each breath, requiring them to use supplemental oxygen above about 8,000 m (the "death zone").

At a spot in the high Andes, water boils at  $$ 80.0\text{ºC} $$ ,
 greatly reducing the cooking speed of potatoes, for example. What is atmospheric pressure at this location?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Water boils when its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. Find the vapor pressure of water at 80.0ºC from Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the vapor pressure of water at 80ºC is $$ 4.73 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa.

Since water boils when its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, the atmospheric pressure at this location is $$ 4.73 \times 10^{4} $$ Pa, or approximately 0.467 atm.

**Discussion:**
This atmospheric pressure is less than half of standard atmospheric pressure (1.01 × 10⁵ Pa), indicating a very high altitude—approximately 5500-6000 m above sea level. At this pressure, water boils 20ºC below its sea-level boiling point, making cooking very difficult.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the definition of relative humidity as the ratio of actual vapor density to saturation vapor density. Find the saturation vapor density at 25.0ºC from Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the saturation vapor density at 25.0ºC is 23.0 g/m³.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Relative humidity}=\frac{\text{actual vapor density}}{\text{saturation vapor density}} \times 100=\frac{18.0 \text{ g/m}^{3}}{23.0 \text{ g/m}^{3}} \times 100=78.3\% $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
A relative humidity of 78.3% indicates the air is holding about three-quarters of the maximum water vapor it can contain at 25ºC. This would feel quite humid and muggy, as evaporation of perspiration from skin would be inhibited, making it harder for the body to cool itself. For comparison, comfortable indoor humidity is typically 30-50%. At 100% relative humidity, the air is saturated and cannot hold any more water vapor, so sweat cannot evaporate and cooling becomes very difficult.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the definition of relative humidity as the ratio of actual vapor density to saturation vapor density. Find the saturation vapor density at 40.0ºC from Table 1, then calculate the actual vapor density.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the saturation vapor density at 40.0ºC is 51.1 g/m³.

The relative humidity is defined as:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Relative humidity}=\frac{\text{actual vapor density}}{\text{saturation vapor density}} \times 100 $$

 $$\text{Actual vapor density}=\frac{\text{Relative humidity}}{100} \times \text{saturation vapor density} $$

 $$\text{Actual vapor density}=\frac{ 6.00}{100} \times 51.1 \text{ g/m}^{3}= 3.07 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$

**Discussion:**
Even though the temperature is high (40.0ºC), the very low relative humidity (6.00%) means there is very little water vapor in the air. This extremely dry condition is typical of desert environments and explains why deserts feel so dry and why water evaporates very rapidly there.

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Use the ideal gas law $$PV=nRT$$ to find the number of moles per unit volume, then convert to density in g/m³ using the molecular mass of water (18.0 g/mol).

**Solution:**
1. Convert temperature to Kelvin:
<div class="equation" >
 $$T= 40.0\text{ºC}+ 273.15 = 313.15 \text{ K} $$
</div>

2. Rearrange ideal gas law to find molar density (n/V):

 $$\frac{n}{V}=\frac{P}{RT}=\frac{ 7.34 \times 10^{3}  \text{Pa}}{\left( 8.31 \text{ J/mol}\cdot \text{K}\right)\left( 313.15 \text{ K}\right)}= 2.82 \text{ mol/m}^{3} $$

 $$\rho =\left( 2.82 \text{ mol/m}^{3}\right)\left( 18.0 \text{ g/mol}\right)= 50.8 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$

**Discussion:**
The calculated value of 50.8 g/m³ is very close to the tabulated value of 51.1 g/m³, with the small difference due to rounding.

**Strategy:**
(a) Calculate mass from density and volume. (b) Use the ideal gas law to find pressure from density.

**Solution:**
(a) Volume exhaled: $$V = 2.00 \text{ L} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^{3}$$

Maximum water vapor loss (if exhaled air is saturated):
<div class="equation" >
 $$m=\rho V=\left(44.0 \text{ g/m}^{3}\right)\left( 2.00 \times 10^{-3}  \text{ m}^{3}\right)= 8.80 \times 10^{-2}  \text{g} $$

This is nearly identical to the vapor pressure of $$ 6.31 \times 10^{3} $$ Pa from Table 1.

Part (a) shows that with each exhalation of 2 L, we lose about 0.088 g of water vapor if we inhale completely dry air. Over a day with about 20,000 breaths, this could amount to significant water loss (about 880 g or nearly 1 liter). In reality, inhaled air usually contains some moisture, so actual losses are less. Part (b) confirms that the ideal gas law accurately predicts the relationship between vapor density and pressure, validating the table values. This is why breathing passages must stay moist—the lungs saturate inhaled air with water vapor at body temperature.

**Discussion:**
The relative humidity nearly doubles from 45% to 82% as the temperature drops by just 10ºC, even though the actual amount of water vapor in the air remains constant.

 (c) One of the most severe problems for those climbing very high mountains is the extreme drying of breathing passages. Why does this drying occur?

**Strategy:**
(a) Calculate the partial pressure using Dalton's law. (b) Find what percentage gives the same partial pressure as at sea level. (c) Consider the relationship between total pressure, partial pressure of water vapor, and relative humidity.

**Solution:**
(a) The partial pressure of oxygen at Mt. Everest:
<div class="equation" >

 $$\text{Percent O}_2=\frac{ 2.11 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa}}{ 3.30 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa}} \times 100 = 64.0\% $$
</div>

(c) The extreme drying occurs because the partial pressure of water vapor is limited by the vapor pressure at the local temperature. At high altitude, the very low total atmospheric pressure means that even at 100% relative humidity, the absolute amount of water vapor is extremely small. When climbers inhale this dry air, their warm, moist breathing passages lose water vapor to humidify the inhaled air, causing severe dehydration of the respiratory tract.

**Discussion:**
Part (b) shows why supplemental oxygen is essential for climbing Mt. Everest—the oxygen concentration must be increased to about 64% (compared to 21% at sea level) to maintain the same oxygen partial pressure. The drying effect in part (c) is one of many physiological challenges of high-altitude climbing, contributing to the extreme difficulty and danger of climbing peaks above 8000 m (the "death zone").

What is the dew point (the temperature at which 100% relative humidity would occur) on a day when relative humidity is 39.0% at a temperature of  $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Calculate the actual vapor density at current conditions. Then find the temperature at which this vapor density equals the saturation vapor density using Table 1.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, saturation vapor density at 20.0ºC = 17.2 g/m³.

Actual vapor density:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho_{\text{vapor}}=\frac{39.0}{100} \times 17.2 \text{ g/m}^{3}= 6.71 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$
</div>

Looking at Table 1 for the temperature where saturation vapor density = 6.71 g/m³:
- At 5ºC: 6.80 g/m³
- At 0ºC: 4.84 g/m³

By interpolation between these values, the dew point is approximately **4.77ºC** (closer to 5ºC).

**Discussion:**
The dew point of 4.77ºC is the temperature at which the current water vapor in the air would saturate the air (100% relative humidity). If the temperature drops to this point or below, water vapor will begin to condense as dew, fog, or frost. The large difference between the current temperature (20ºC) and the dew point (4.77ºC) indicates relatively dry conditions—the air is holding only 39% of the maximum water it could hold at 20ºC. Meteorologists use dew point as an important indicator: dew points above 20ºC feel very humid and uncomfortable, while dew points below 10ºC feel dry and comfortable.

 and the relative humidity is 90.0%. How many grams of water must condense out of each cubic meter of air if the temperature falls to  $$ 15.0\text{ºC} $$ ?
 Such a drop in temperature can, thus, produce heavy dew or fog.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
First calculate the actual vapor density at 25.0ºC with 90.0% relative humidity. Then find the saturation vapor density at 15.0ºC. The difference is the amount that must condense.

**Solution:**
From Table 1:
- Saturation vapor density at 25.0ºC = 23.0 g/m³
- Saturation vapor density at 15.0ºC = 12.8 g/m³

Initial vapor density at 25.0ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho_{\text{initial}}=\frac{90.0}{100} \times 23.0 \text{ g/m}^{3}= 20.7 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$
</div>

When the temperature drops to 15.0ºC, the air can hold only 12.8 g/m³ at 100% relative humidity. The amount that must condense:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta \rho = 20.7 \text{ g/m}^{3}- 12.8 \text{ g/m}^{3}= 7.9 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
This significant amount of condensation (7.9 g/m³) explains why heavy dew or fog can form when air cools at night. The water vapor in the air exceeds the saturation point at the lower temperature, forcing the excess to condense into liquid droplets. This is why fog often forms in valleys on clear nights when radiative cooling drops the temperature, and why dew forms on grass and car windshields in the early morning.

The boiling point of water increases with depth because pressure increases with
depth. At what depth will fresh water have a boiling point of $$150\text{ºC} $$
, if the surface of the water is at sea level?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. Find the vapor pressure at 150ºC from Table 1. This pressure must equal atmospheric pressure plus the hydrostatic pressure from the water column. Use $$P=P_{\text{atm}}+\rho gh$$ to find depth.

**Solution:**
From Table 1, the vapor pressure of water at 150ºC is $$ 4.76 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa.

At depth $$h$$, the total pressure is:
<div class="equation" >
 $$P_{\text{total}}=P_{\text{atm}}+\rho gh $$
</div>

Setting this equal to the vapor pressure:
<div class="equation" >
 $$ 4.76 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}+\left(1000 \text{ kg/m}^{3}\right)\left( 9.8 \text{ m/s}^{2}\right)h $$
</div>

Solving for $$h$$:
<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{ 4.76 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}}{\left(1000 \text{ kg/m}^{3}\right)\left( 9.8 \text{ m/s}^{2}\right)}=\frac{ 3.75 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}}{9800 \text{ Pa/m}}= 38.3 \text{ m} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
At a depth of 38.3 meters below the surface, the pressure is high enough (4.76 atm) that water will boil at 150ºC instead of the normal 100ºC. This principle is important in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where water can remain liquid at temperatures well above 100ºC due to the immense pressure. It's also relevant for geothermal energy systems and industrial processes. The increased boiling point at depth is the same principle used in pressure cookers, but achieved through water depth rather than a sealed container.

(a) At what depth in fresh water is the critical pressure of water reached,
given that the surface is at sea level? (b) At what temperature will this water
boil? (c) Is a significantly higher temperature needed to boil water at a
greater depth?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) From Table 1 in the Phase Changes section, find the critical pressure of water and use the hydrostatic pressure formula to find depth. (b) At the critical temperature, water cannot exist as a liquid. (c) Consider what happens above the critical point.

**Solution:**
(a) From the text, the critical pressure of water is $$ 22.12 \times 10^{6} $$ Pa. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is $$ 1.01 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa.

The gauge pressure needed is:
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}= 22.12 \times 10^{6}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\approx 2.20 \times 10^{7}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

Using $$P=\rho gh$$ with $$\rho = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^{3}$$ for water:
<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{P}{\rho g}=\frac{ 2.20 \times 10^{7}  \text{Pa}}{\left(1000 \text{ kg/m}^{3}\right)\left( 9.8 \text{ m/s}^{2}\right)}= 2245 \text{ m} $$
</div>

(b) At the critical pressure, water boils at the critical temperature of 374.3ºC (from the text).

(c) No, a higher temperature is not needed at greater depths. Above the critical point (pressure > 22.12 × 10⁶ Pa and temperature > 374.3ºC), there is no distinction between liquid and gas phases. Water exists as a supercritical fluid and cannot boil in the traditional sense.

**Discussion:**
The depth of about 2.2 km is relatively shallow in oceanic terms (average ocean depth is about 3.7 km). However, at this depth and the critical temperature, water behavior changes fundamentally. This has implications for hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, where superheated water emerges from Earth's crust.

If you want to cook in water at $$150\text{ºC} $$ , you need a pressure cooker
that can withstand the necessary pressure. (a) What pressure is required for the
boiling point of water to be this high? (b) If the lid of the pressure cooker is
a disk 25.0 cm in diameter, what force must it be able to withstand at this
pressure?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. Find the vapor pressure of water at 150ºC from Table 1. (b) Calculate the force using $$F=PA$$, but use the gauge pressure (excess above atmospheric) since atmospheric pressure pushes on both sides of the lid.

**Solution:**
(a) From Table 1, the vapor pressure of water at 150ºC is $$ 4.76 \times 10^{5} $$ Pa.

This is the required pressure for water to boil at 150ºC.

(b) The force on the lid is due to the gauge pressure (pressure above atmospheric):
<div class="equation" >
 $${P}_{\text{gauge}}= 4.76 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}- 1.01 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}= 3.75 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa} $$
</div>

Area of the lid:
<div class="equation" >
 $$A=\pi r^{2}=\pi {\left(\frac{0.250 \text{ m}}{2}\right)}^{2}= 4.91 \times 10^{-2}  \text{ m}^{2} $$
</div>

Force on the lid:
<div class="equation" >
 $$F={P}_{\text{gauge}} \times A=\left( 3.75 \times 10^{5}  \text{Pa}\right)\left( 4.91 \times 10^{-2}  \text{ m}^{2}\right)= 1.84 \times 10^{4}  \text{N} $$
</div>

**Discussion:**
The required pressure is about 4.7 atm (about 70 psi), which is typical for pressure cookers. The force of 18,400 N (about 4100 pounds or 1.9 tons) is enormous! This is why pressure cooker lids must lock securely and why the seals must be in good condition. This also explains why pressure cookers have safety valves—if the pressure gets too high, the valve releases steam before the force can rupture the cooker. The high pressure allows water to remain liquid at 150ºC, significantly speeding up cooking compared to normal boiling at 100ºC.

(a) An automobile mechanic claims that an aluminum rod fits loosely into its
hole on an aluminum engine block because the engine is hot and the rod is cold.
If the hole is 10.0% bigger in diameter than the $$ 22.0\text{ºC} $$ rod, at
what temperature will the rod be the same size as the hole? (b) What is
unreasonable about this temperature? (c) Which premise is responsible?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Use thermal expansion to find what temperature would make the hole 10% larger. Since both rod and hole are aluminum, they expand at the same rate, so the mechanic's explanation doesn't work. Calculate anyway to show why. (b) and (c) Analyze the result.

**Solution:**
(a) For the hole to be 10.0% larger in diameter:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L= 0.100 L $$
</div>

Using $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T$$:
<div class="equation" >
 $$ 0.100 L=\alpha L\Delta T $$
</div>

From Table 1 in the Thermal Expansion section, for aluminum: $$\alpha = 25 \times 10^{-6} \text{/ºC}$$

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta T=\frac{0.100}{\alpha}=\frac{ 0.100}{ 25 \times 10^{-6}  \text{/ºC}}= 4000\text{ºC} $$
</div>

Temperature of the engine block:
<div class="equation" >
 $$T= 22.0\text{ºC}+ 4000\text{ºC}= 4022\text{ºC} $$
</div>

(b) This temperature is absurdly high—far above the melting point of aluminum (660ºC). The engine block would be completely melted and vaporized at this temperature.

(c) The faulty premise is that the engine block is hot while the rod is cold. Since both are made of aluminum, they have the same coefficient of thermal expansion. If they were both at the same temperature initially (when they fit properly), heating only the block would make the hole larger, but the rod would have to be heated by the same amount to expand enough to fit the larger hole. The mechanic's explanation doesn't work because you can't have an aluminum hole expand without an aluminum rod expanding by the same proportion at the same temperature.

**Discussion:**
This problem reveals a common misconception about thermal expansion. If the rod fits loosely, it's more likely due to: (1) manufacturing tolerances, (2) wear, (3) the rod and block being made of different materials with different expansion coefficients, or (4) differential temperature if they've been in different environments. The fact that both are aluminum means thermal expansion cannot explain the loose fit if both are at the same temperature.

Suppose the relative humidity is 80% on a day when the temperature is $$ 30.0\text{ºC} $$ .
(a) What will the relative humidity be if the air cools to $$ 25.0\text{ºC} $$
and the vapor density remains constant? (b) What is unreasonable about this
result? (c) Which premise is responsible?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy:**
(a) Find the actual vapor density at 30.0ºC with 80% humidity, then calculate what relative humidity this represents at 25.0ºC. (b) and (c) Analyze whether the result makes physical sense.

**Solution:**
(a) From Table 1:
- Saturation vapor density at 30.0ºC = 30.4 g/m³
- Saturation vapor density at 25.0ºC = 23.0 g/m³

Actual vapor density (which remains constant):
<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho_{\text{vapor}}=\frac{80.0}{100} \times 30.4 \text{ g/m}^{3}= 24.3 \text{ g/m}^{3} $$
</div>

Relative humidity at 25.0ºC:
<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Relative humidity}=\frac{ 24.3 \text{ g/m}^{3}}{ 23.0 \text{ g/m}^{3}} \times 100 = 106\% $$
</div>

(b) A relative humidity greater than 100% is impossible. Relative humidity cannot exceed 100% because that represents saturation—the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at that temperature.

(c) The faulty premise is that "the vapor density remains constant" when the air cools from 30.0ºC to 25.0ºC. In reality, when air cools below the dew point (the temperature at which it reaches 100% relative humidity), water vapor must condense out.

The dew point for air at 30.0ºC with 80% humidity occurs when the temperature drops to where 24.3 g/m³ is the saturation density. From Table 1, this occurs at about 26-27ºC. Therefore, as the air cools below 27ºC, water vapor condenses as dew, fog, or clouds, and the vapor density decreases to match the saturation value at the new temperature.

**Discussion:**
This problem illustrates why dew forms on grass and car windshields on cool mornings, why fog forms when warm moist air cools, and why clouds form when rising air expands and cools. The atmosphere cannot maintain water vapor densities above saturation—excess moisture must condense. This is a fundamental principle in meteorology and explains many weather phenomena.
