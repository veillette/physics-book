* Name several real-world applications of the study of electrostatics.
</div>

The study of **electrostatics** has proven useful in many areas. This module
covers just a few of the many applications of electrostatics.

### The Van de Graaff Generator

**Van de Graaff generators** (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular
devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity—they are also
used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (
based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics
research. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows a schematic of a large research version.
Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and
insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages.

A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves
quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric
fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free
charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless,
voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits.

![Schematic of Van de Graaff generator is shown. The parts of the generators shown include a conductor, insulator, nonconductive belt, ion source, and experimental area.](../resources/Figure_18_08_02.jpg 'Schematic of Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outside surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities.')

Rub a comb through your hair and use it to lift pieces of paper. It may help to tear the pieces of paper rather than cut them neatly. Repeat the exercise in your bathroom after you have had a long shower and the air in the bathroom is moist. Is it easier to get electrostatic effects in dry or moist air? Why would torn paper be more attractive to the comb than cut paper? Explain your observations.

</div>

### Xerography

Most copy machines use an electrostatic process called **xerography**—a word
coined from the Greek words _xeros_ for dry and _graphos_ for writing. The heart
of the process is shown in simplified form in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).

A selenium-coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a
device called a corotron. Selenium is a substance with an interesting
property—it is a **photoconductor**. That is, selenium is an insulator when in
the dark and a conductor when exposed to light.

In the first stage of the xerography process, the conducting aluminum drum is **grounded** so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of
uniformly positively charged selenium. In the second stage, the surface of the
drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied. Where the image is
light, the selenium becomes conducting, and the positive charge is neutralized.
In dark areas, the positive charge remains, and so the image has been
transferred to the drum.

The third stage takes a dry black powder, called toner, and sprays it with a
negative charge so that it will be attracted to the positive regions of the
drum. Next, a blank piece of paper is given a greater positive charge than on
the drum so that it will pull the toner from the drum. Finally, the paper and
electrostatically held toner are passed through heated pressure rollers, which
melt and permanently adhere the toner within the fibers of the paper.

![Four stages of xerography are shown. A positively charged aluminum drum is shown which is grounded. In second stage image is being transferred to it, creating positive image. In third stage, negatively charged toner is attached with the drum and in fourth stage, toner is pulled by the paper which is highly charged.](../resources/Figure_18_08_03.jpg 'Xerography is a dry copying process based on electrostatics. The major steps in the process are the charging of the photoconducting drum, transfer of an image creating a positive charge duplicate, attraction of toner to the charged parts of the drum, and transfer of toner to the paper. Not shown are heat treatment of the paper and cleansing of the drum for the next copy.')
{: #Figure2}

### Laser Printers

**Laser printers** use the xerographic process to make high-quality images on
paper, employing a laser to produce an image on the photoconducting drum as
shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). In its most common application, the laser
printer receives output from a computer, and it can achieve high-quality output
because of the precision with which laser light can be controlled. Many laser
printers do significant information processing, such as making sophisticated
letters or fonts, and may contain a computer more powerful than the one giving
them the raw data to be printed.

![A laser printer mechanism is shown. Laser beam produced from a computer, laser, or optics is incident on the drum containing some image.](../resources/Figure_18_08_04.jpg 'In a laser printer, a laser beam is scanned across a photoconducting drum, leaving a positive charge image. The other steps for charging the drum and transferring the image to paper are the same as in xerography. Laser light can be very precisely controlled, enabling laser printers to produce high-quality images.')
{: #Figure3}

### Ink Jet Printers and Electrostatic Painting

The **ink jet printer**, commonly used to print computer-generated text and
graphics, also employs electrostatics. A nozzle makes a fine spray of tiny ink
droplets, which are then given an electrostatic charge. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).)

Once charged, the droplets can be directed, using pairs of charged plates, with
great precision to form letters and images on paper. Ink jet printers can
produce color images by using a black jet and three other jets with primary
colors, usually cyan, magenta, and yellow, much as a color television produces
color. (This is more difficult with xerography, requiring multiple drums and
toners.)

![An ink-jet printer mechanism is shown. Ink is projected from ink nozzle and passes through the charging electrodes moving through deflection plate and finally imprinting on paper.](../resources/Figure_18_08_05.jpg 'The nozzle of an ink-jet printer produces small ink droplets, which are sprayed with electrostatic charge. Various computer-driven devices are then used to direct the droplets to the correct positions on a page.')
{: #Figure4}

Electrostatic painting employs electrostatic charge to spray paint onto
odd-shaped surfaces. Mutual repulsion of like charges causes the paint to fly
away from its source. Surface tension forms drops, which are then attracted by
unlike charges to the surface to be painted. Electrostatic painting can reach
those hard-to-get at places, applying an even coat in a controlled manner. If
the object is a conductor, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface,
tending to bring the drops in perpendicularly. Corners and points on conductors
will receive extra paint. Felt can similarly be applied.

### Smoke Precipitators and Electrostatic Air Cleaning

Another important application of electrostatics is found in air cleaners, both
large and small. The electrostatic part of the process places excess (usually
positive) charge on smoke, dust, pollen, and other particles in the air and then
passes the air through an oppositely charged grid that attracts and retains the
charged particles. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).)

Large **electrostatic precipitators** are used industrially to remove over 99%
of the particles from stack gas emissions associated with the burning of coal
and oil. Home precipitators, often in conjunction with the home heating and air
conditioning system, are very effective in removing polluting particles,
irritants, and allergens.

(b) The dramatic effect of electrostatic precipitators is seen by the absence of smoke from this power plant.[alt]Schematic of an electrostatic precipitator is shown. Four filters are shown one after another.

The number of particles is shown decreasing as air passes through various filters.](../resources/Figure_18_08_06.jpg '(a) Schematic of an electrostatic precipitator.

Problem-Solving Strategies for Electrostatics
</div>
1.   Examine the situation to determine if static electricity is involved. This may concern separated stationary charges, the forces among them, and the electric fields they create.
2.   Identify the system of interest. This includes noting the number, locations, and types of charges involved.
3.   Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Determine whether the Coulomb force is to be considered directly—if so, it may be useful to draw a free-body diagram, using electric field lines.
4.   Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is important to distinguish the Coulomb force  $$F $$  from the electric field
     $$E $$, for example.
5.   Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown) or draw the field lines as requested.
6.   Examine the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? Are units correct and the numbers involved reasonable?

</div>

### Integrated Concepts

The Integrated Concepts exercises for this module involve concepts such as
electric charges, electric fields, and several other topics. Physics is most
interesting when applied to general situations involving more than a narrow set
of physical principles. The electric field exerts force on charges, for example,
and hence the relevance
of [Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics). The following topics
are involved in some or all of the problems labeled “Integrated Concepts”:

- [Kinematics](./ch2Kinematics)
- [Two-Dimensional Kinematics](./ch3KinematicsInTwoDimensionsAnIntroduction)
- [Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics)
- [Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation](./ch6UniformCircularMotionAndGravitation)
- [Statics and Torque](./ch9StaticsAndTorque)
- [Fluid Statics](../contents/ch11FluidStatics)

The following worked example illustrates how this strategy is applied to an
Integrated Concept problem:

<div class="example"  markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Acceleration of a Charged Drop of Gasoline
</div>
If steps are not taken to ground a gasoline pump, static electricity can be placed on gasoline when filling your car’s tank. Suppose a tiny drop of gasoline has a mass of  $$4.00 \times 10^{-15}  \text{kg} $$
 and is given a positive charge of  $$3.20 \times 10^{-19}  \text{C} $$ .
 (a) Find the weight of the drop. (b) Calculate the electric force on the drop if there is an upward electric field of strength  $$3.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{N/C} $$
 due to other static electricity in the vicinity. (c) Calculate the drop’s acceleration.

**Strategy**

To solve an integrated concept problem, we must first identify the physical
principles involved and identify the chapters in which they are found. Part (a)
of this example asks for weight. This is a topic of dynamics and is defined
in [Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics). Part (b) deals with
electric force on a charge, a topic
of [Electric Charge and Electric Field](../contents/ch18ElectricChargeAndElectricField).
Part (c) asks for acceleration, knowing forces and mass. These are part of
Newton’s laws, also found
in [Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics).

The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how the specific
problem-solving strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and
unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so on.

**Solution for (a)**

Weight is mass times the acceleration due to gravity, as first expressed in

<div class="equation" >
 $$w=mg. $$
</div>
Entering the given mass and the average acceleration due to gravity yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$w=\left( 4.00 \times 10^{-15}  \text{kg}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)= 3.92 \times 10^{-14}  \text{N}. $$
</div>
**Discussion for (a)**

This is a small weight, consistent with the small mass of the drop.

**Solution for (b)**

The force an electric field exerts on a charge is given by rearranging the
following equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=qE. $$
</div>
Here we are given the charge ( $$3.20 \times 10^{-19}  \text{C} $$
 is twice the fundamental unit of charge) and the electric field strength, and so the electric force is found to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=\left( 3.20 \times 10^{-19}  \text{C}\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{N/C}\right)= 9.60 \times 10^{-14}  \text{N}. $$
</div>
**Discussion for (b)**

While this is a small force, it is greater than the weight of the drop.

**Solution for (c)**

The acceleration can be found using Newton’s second law, provided we can
identify all of the external forces acting on the drop. We assume only the
drop’s weight and the electric force are significant. Since the drop has a
positive charge and the electric field is given to be upward, the electric force
is upward. We thus have a one-dimensional (vertical direction) problem, and we
can state Newton’s second law as

<div class="equation" >
 $$a=\frac{ {F}_{\text{net}}}{m}. $$
</div>
where  $${F}_{\text{net}}=F-w $$ .
 Entering this and the known values into the expression for Newton’s second law yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}a& =& \frac{F-w}{m}\\ & =& \frac{ 9.60 \times 10^{-14}  \text{N}- 3.92 \times 10^{-14}  \text{N}}{ 4.00 \times 10^{-15}  \text{kg}}\\ & =&  14.2 {\text{m/s}}^{2}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion for (c)**

This is an upward acceleration great enough to carry the drop to places where
you might not wish to have gasoline.

This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to
situations that include topics in different chapters. The first step is to
identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to
solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found
throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single
topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can see how to apply them
across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of
physics outside a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science
disciplines, and in everyday life. The following problems will build your skills
in the broad application of physical principles.

Unreasonable Results
</div>
The Unreasonable Results exercises for this module have results that are unreasonable because some premise is unreasonable or because certain of the premises are inconsistent with one another. Physical principles applied correctly then produce unreasonable results. The purpose of these problems is to give practice in assessing whether nature is being accurately described, and if it is not to trace the source of difficulty.

Problem-Solving Strategy
</div>
To determine if an answer is reasonable, and to determine the cause if it is not, do the following.

1. Solve the problem using strategies as outlined above. Use the format followed
   in the worked examples in the text to solve the problem as usual.
2. Check to see if the answer is reasonable. Is it too large or too small, or
   does it have the wrong sign, improper units, and so on?
3. If the answer is unreasonable, look for what specifically could cause the
   identified difficulty. Usually, the manner in which the answer is
   unreasonable is an indication of the difficulty. For example, an extremely
   large Coulomb force could be due to the assumption of an excessively large
   separated charge.

### Section Summary

- Electrostatics is the study of electric fields in static equilibrium.
- In addition to research using equipment such as a Van de Graaff generator,
  many practical applications of electrostatics exist, including photocopiers,
  laser printers, ink-jet printers and electrostatic air filters.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the electric field 5.00 m from the center of the terminal of a Van de Graaff with a 3.00 mC charge, noting that the field is equivalent to that of a point charge at the center of the terminal? (b) At this distance, what force does the field exert on a  $$2.00 \mu \text{C} $$
 charge on the Van de Graaff's belt?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we treat the charged Van de Graaff terminal as a point charge and use the electric field formula $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2}$$, where $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$. For part (b), we use the relationship between electric field and force: $$F = qE$$.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$q = 3.00 \text{ mC} = 3.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ C}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$r = 5.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$
</div>

Calculate the electric field:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)(3.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ C})}{(5.00 \text{ m})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{2.697 \times 10^7 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}}{25.0 \text{ m}^2} = 1.08 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

**(b)** Given the charge on the belt:

<div class="equation">
 $$q_{\text{belt}} = 2.00 \mu\text{C} = 2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$
</div>

Calculate the force:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = q_{\text{belt}} E = (2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C})(1.08 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = 2.16 \text{ N}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The electric field 5.00 m from the Van de Graaff terminal is 1.08 × 10⁶ N/C, which is a very strong field—about 7000 times stronger than Earth's atmospheric electric field. This high field strength is characteristic of Van de Graaff generators and is what makes them useful for accelerating charged particles in physics research.

Part (b): The force on the 2.00 μC charge is 2.16 N, which is substantial for such a small charge. This force is roughly equivalent to the weight of a 220-gram object. This demonstrates why Van de Graaff generators are effective at moving charges along the belt—the strong electric field exerts significant forces even on the relatively small charges carried by the belt. The direction of the force would be radially outward from the terminal if the belt charge is positive (repulsive), which is the configuration that allows the terminal to accumulate charge.

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) What is the direction and magnitude of an electric field that supports the weight of a free electron near the surface of Earth? (b) Discuss what the small value for this field implies regarding the relative strength of the gravitational and electrostatic forces.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), the electric force on the electron must equal its weight to support it. Since $$F = qE$$ and weight $$w = mg$$, we can set $$qE = mg$$ and solve for $$E$$. The electron has negative charge, so the field must point upward to produce a downward force that opposes the upward weight (or equivalently, the field points upward to push the negative charge upward). For part (b), we compare this field to typical electric fields to understand the relative strength of electrostatic versus gravitational forces.

**Solution**

**(a)** Known values:
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge magnitude: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$

The weight of the electron:

<div class="equation">
 $$w = m_e g = (9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2) = 8.93 \times 10^{-30} \text{ N}$$
</div>

For the electric force to support this weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_e = w$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$eE = m_e g$$
</div>

Solving for the electric field:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{m_e g}{e} = \frac{8.93 \times 10^{-30} \text{ N}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = 5.58 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

To determine the direction: The weight of the electron points downward, so we need an upward force to support it. For a negatively charged particle, the electric force is $$\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$$, where $$q$$ is negative. This means the force is opposite to the field direction. To get an upward force on a negative charge, we need a downward electric field.

**Direction: Downward (toward Earth's surface)**
**Magnitude: $$5.58 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N/C}$$**

**(b)** This electric field strength is extraordinarily small—about one trillion times weaker than typical electric fields encountered in laboratories (which are often on the order of $$10^3$$ to $$10^6$$ N/C). Even Earth's own atmospheric electric field of about 150 N/C is over 2 trillion times stronger than the field needed to support an electron.

This demonstrates that the electrostatic force is extraordinarily stronger than the gravitational force at the atomic scale. It takes only a minuscule electric field to balance gravity for an electron, showing that electrostatic forces dominate completely over gravitational forces in atomic and molecular interactions.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The electric field required to support an electron is only $$5.58 \times 10^{-11}$$ N/C, directed downward. This is an incredibly weak field by electrostatic standards.

Part (b): This tiny field value has profound implications. The fact that such a weak electric field can support an electron against gravity illustrates the enormous difference in strength between electrostatic and gravitational forces. In atomic and molecular systems, gravity is completely negligible compared to electromagnetic forces.

This is why atomic structure is determined entirely by electromagnetic forces—the gravitational attraction between an electron and a proton is about $$10^{40}$$ times weaker than their electrostatic attraction (as calculated in Chapter 18.3). If you tried to use gravity to hold atoms together, you would need impossibly massive particles. Instead, nature uses the much stronger electromagnetic force, which is why ordinary matter has the properties it does. This also explains why we can easily overcome gravity with everyday electrostatic effects, like picking up paper bits with a charged comb.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A simple and common technique for accelerating electrons is shown in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6), where there is a uniform electric field between two plates. Electrons are released, usually from a hot filament, near the negative plate, and there is a small hole in the positive plate that allows the electrons to continue moving. (a) Calculate the acceleration of the electron if the field strength is  $$2.50 \times 10^{4}  \text{N/C} $$ .
 (b) Explain why the electron will not be pulled back to the positive plate once it moves through the hole.

![Parallel conducting plates with opposite charges are shown and electric field lines are emerging from the positive plate and entering the negative plate. These lines are parallel between the plates but curved at the corner.](../resources/Figure_18_08_07.jpg 'Parallel conducting plates with opposite charges on them create a relatively uniform electric field used to accelerate electrons to the right. Those that go through the hole can be used to make a TV or computer screen glow or to produce X-rays.')
{: #Figure6}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the relationship between electric field and force ($$F = eE$$) combined with Newton's second law ($$F = ma$$) to find the acceleration. For part (b), we consider what happens to the electric field once the electron passes through the hole in the positive plate.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:
- Electric field: $$E = 2.50 \times 10^4 \text{ N/C}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge magnitude: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

The force on the electron:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = eE = (1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(2.50 \times 10^4 \text{ N/C})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = 4.00 \times 10^{-15} \text{ N}$$
</div>

Using Newton's second law:

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{F}{m_e} = \frac{4.00 \times 10^{-15} \text{ N}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$a = 4.39 \times 10^{15} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

**(b)** Once the electron passes through the hole in the positive plate, it is no longer in the uniform electric field between the plates. The field exists primarily between the two plates, and beyond the positive plate, the field is negligible (or much weaker). Without a significant electric field to exert a force on it, the electron continues moving in its forward direction by inertia. The positive plate shields the region beyond it from the electric field created by the charge configuration, so there is no force to pull the electron back.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The acceleration of $$4.39 \times 10^{15} \text{ m/s}^2$$ is enormous—nearly $$10^{15}$$ times Earth's gravitational acceleration! This demonstrates why electric fields are so effective at accelerating charged particles. Even a relatively modest field of $$2.50 \times 10^4$$ N/C can produce extraordinary accelerations for electrons due to their tiny mass. This principle is used in cathode ray tubes (old TV screens), electron microscopes, and X-ray tubes.

Part (b): The key insight is that the electric field is confined to the region between the plates. Once the electron escapes through the hole, it enters a field-free region and continues by inertia (Newton's first law). This is similar to how a ball thrown through a window continues moving after leaving the window—the force that accelerated it (in this case, the electric field) is no longer present. This design allows the accelerated electrons to be used for various applications, such as striking a phosphor screen in a television or targeting atoms in an X-ray machine. The electron gun configuration shown here is fundamental to many important technologies.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Earth has a net charge that produces an electric field of approximately 150 N/C downward at its surface. (a) What is the magnitude and sign of the excess charge, noting the electric field of a conducting sphere is equivalent to a point charge at its center? (b) What acceleration will the field produce on a free electron near Earth's surface? (c) What mass object with a single extra electron will have its weight supported by this field?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we treat Earth as a conducting sphere with a point charge at its center that produces the observed field at its surface. Using $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2}$$, we can solve for $$q$$. The field direction tells us the sign of the charge. For part (b), we use $$F = eE$$ and $$a = F/m$$ to find the electron's acceleration. For part (c), we find the mass for which the electric force on a single electron equals the object's weight.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:
- Electric field at surface: $$E = 150 \text{ N/C}$$ (downward)
- Earth's radius: $$r_E = 6.37 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$$
- Coulomb's constant: $$k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$$

Using the electric field formula for a sphere:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = k\frac{\mid q \mid}{r_E^2}$$
</div>

Solving for the charge magnitude:

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \frac{Er_E^2}{k} = \frac{(150 \text{ N/C})(6.37 \times 10^6 \text{ m})^2}{8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \frac{(150)(4.06 \times 10^{13})}{8.99 \times 10^9} = \frac{6.09 \times 10^{15}}{8.99 \times 10^9}$$

 $$q = 6.77 \times 10^5 \text{ C}$$

Since the field points downward (toward Earth's center), and electric field lines point away from positive charges and toward negative charges, Earth must have a **negative** charge:

 $$q = -6.77 \times 10^5 \text{ C} \approx -6.76 \times 10^5 \text{ C}$$

- Electron charge: $$e = -1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$

The force on the electron (field points down, electron is negative, so force points up):

The acceleration:

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{F}{m_e} = \frac{2.40 \times 10^{-17} \text{ N}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}} = 2.63 \times 10^{13} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

Direction: **upward** (opposite to the field direction for a negative charge)

**(c)** For the weight to be supported by the electric force on one extra electron:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_e = mg$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$eE = mg$$

Solving for mass:

<div class="equation">
 $$m = \frac{eE}{g} = \frac{(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})(150 \text{ N/C})}{9.80 \text{ m/s}^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$m = \frac{2.40 \times 10^{-17} \text{ N}}{9.80 \text{ m/s}^2} = 2.45 \times 10^{-18} \text{ kg}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): Earth has a net negative charge of approximately $$-6.76 \times 10^5$$ C. While this seems like a large charge (equivalent to about $$4 \times 10^{24}$$ excess electrons), it's actually quite small compared to the total amount of charge in Earth. This net charge creates the fair-weather electric field observed at Earth's surface and is maintained by processes in the ionosphere.

Part (b): The acceleration of $$2.63 \times 10^{13} \text{ m/s}^2$$ is enormous—about $$10^{12}$$ times greater than $$g$$. However, this represents the acceleration in the absence of collisions with air molecules. In reality, free electrons in air undergo frequent collisions that limit their net motion. This calculation shows that even Earth's relatively weak atmospheric field can strongly affect free charges.

Part (c): An object with mass $$2.45 \times 10^{-18}$$ kg (about 2.45 femtograms) with one extra electron would have its weight exactly balanced by the electric force. This is roughly the mass of a few thousand water molecules. This demonstrates that Earth's electric field, while weak compared to laboratory fields, can still support extremely light charged particles. In practice, small charged dust particles and water droplets can be suspended or moved by Earth's electric field, contributing to atmospheric electrical phenomena.

Point charges of  $$25.0 \mu \text{C} $$
 and  $$45.0 \mu \text{C} $$
 are placed 0.500 m apart. (a) At what point along the line between them is the electric field zero? (b) What is the electric field halfway between them?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), the electric field is zero where the fields from the two charges cancel. Since both charges are positive, this point must lie between them, closer to the smaller charge. We set the magnitudes of the two fields equal and solve for the position. For part (b), we calculate each field at the midpoint and add them vectorially.

**Solution**

**(a)** Let the distance from the $$25.0 \mu\text{C}$$ charge to the zero-field point be $$x$$. Then the distance from the $$45.0 \mu\text{C}$$ charge is $$(0.500 - x)$$.

At the zero-field point:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_1 = E_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{q_1}{x^2} = k\frac{q_2}{(0.500 - x)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{25.0}{x^2} = \frac{45.0}{(0.500 - x)^2}$$
</div>

Cross-multiplying:

<div class="equation">
 $$25.0(0.500 - x)^2 = 45.0x^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$(0.500 - x)^2 = 1.80x^2$$
</div>

Taking the square root:

<div class="equation">
 $$0.500 - x = \pm\sqrt{1.80}\,x = \pm 1.342x$$
</div>

Taking the positive root (the negative root gives a position outside the region):

<div class="equation">
 $$0.500 - x = 1.342x$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$0.500 = 2.342x$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$x = 0.213 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The zero-field point is **0.213 m from the 25.0 μC charge** (or 0.287 m from the 45.0 μC charge).

**(b)** At the midpoint (0.250 m from each charge), both fields point in the same direction—away from their respective charges, but toward the center from opposite sides.

Field from $$q_1 = 25.0 \mu\text{C}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_1 = k\frac{q_1}{r^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(25.0 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.250)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E_1 = \frac{2.248 \times 10^5}{0.0625} = 3.60 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

Field from $$q_2 = 45.0 \mu\text{C}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_2 = k\frac{q_2}{r^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(45.0 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.250)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E_2 = \frac{4.046 \times 10^5}{0.0625} = 6.47 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

Since both point toward the smaller charge (from right to left if $$q_1$$ is on the left):

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{net}} = E_2 - E_1 = 6.47 \times 10^6 - 3.60 \times 10^6 = 2.87 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

Direction: **toward the 25.0 μC charge** (away from the larger charge)

**Discussion**

Part (a): The zero-field point is 0.213 m from the smaller charge, which makes sense because the field from the larger charge must be weakened by greater distance to balance the weaker field from the smaller charge. The point is closer to the smaller charge, as expected.

Part (b): At the midpoint, the net field is $$2.87 \times 10^6$$ N/C pointing toward the smaller charge. This is a very strong field, typical of the fields near microcoulomb charges at distances of tens of centimeters. The field is not zero at the midpoint because the charges are unequal—the larger charge dominates. This problem demonstrates the superposition principle: the net field is the vector sum of individual fields.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

If the electric field is zero at a point between two charges, the fields from both charges must have equal magnitudes but opposite directions at that point. We can set up the field equation and determine the relationship between $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$.

**Solution**

Let the total distance between the charges be $$d$$. The zero-field point is at distance $$d/4$$ from $$q_1$$ and $$3d/4$$ from $$q_2$$.

For the field to be zero:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_1 = E_2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{\mid q_1 \mid}{(d/4)^2} = k\frac{\mid q_2 \mid}{(3d/4)^2}$$

 $$\frac{16\mid q_1 \mid}{d^2} = \frac{16\mid q_2 \mid}{9d^2}$$

 $$\mid q_1 \mid = \frac{\mid q_2 \mid}{9}$$
</div>

Or equivalently:

<div class="equation">
 $$\mid q_2 \mid = 9\mid q_1 \mid$$
</div>

Since the field is zero between the charges (not outside), they must have the **same sign** (both positive or both negative). If they had opposite signs, the field could only be zero outside the region between them.

**Discussion**

For the electric field to be zero at a point one-fourth of the way from $$q_1$$ to $$q_2$$, the charge $$q_2$$ must be 9 times greater than $$q_1$$ in magnitude, and both charges must have the same sign.

This makes physical sense: the point is three times farther from $$q_2$$ than from $$q_1$$. Since the field decreases as $$1/r^2$$, being three times farther reduces the field by a factor of $$(3)^2 = 9$$. Therefore, $$q_2$$ must be 9 times larger to produce the same field strength at that point.

This problem illustrates an important principle: when looking for zero-field points between like charges, the point is always closer to the smaller charge. The ratio of distances from the zero-field point to each charge is inversely proportional to the square root of the charge ratio. Here, the distance ratio is $$1:3$$, so the charge ratio must be $$1^2:3^2 = 1:9$$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with circular motion. The Coulomb force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion. We set $$F_c = F_e$$ where $$F_c = m\omega^2 r$$ and $$F_e = k\frac{e^2}{r^2}$$, then solve for the angular velocity $$\omega$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Orbit radius: $$r = 0.530 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$

</div>

**Discussion**

The angular velocity of the electron in the hydrogen atom is approximately $$4.12 \times 10^{16}$$ rad/s. This is an extraordinarily high angular velocity! To put it in perspective, the electron completes one orbit in time $$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{4.12 \times 10^{16}} \approx 1.52 \times 10^{-16}$$ seconds, or about 0.152 femtoseconds.

The linear speed of the electron would be $$v = \omega r = (4.12 \times 10^{16})(0.530 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 2.18 \times 10^6$$ m/s, which is about 0.7% the speed of light. This demonstrates that electrons in atoms move at relativistic speeds, which is why quantum mechanics is necessary for an accurate description of atomic structure.

This classical "Bohr model" calculation gives values in the right ballpark but is ultimately inadequate—the true description requires quantum mechanics, where the electron doesn't actually orbit in a well-defined path but exists in a probability cloud. Nevertheless, this calculation illustrates the connection between electrostatic and mechanical principles and shows why atomic processes occur on such short timescales.

An electron has an initial velocity of $$5.00 \times 10^{6} \text{m/s} $$ in a
uniform $$2.00 \times 10^{5} \text{N/C} $$ strength electric field. The field
accelerates the electron in the direction opposite to its initial velocity. (a)
What is the direction of the electric field? (b) How far does the electron
travel before coming to rest? (c) How long does it take the electron to come to
rest? (d) What is the electron's velocity when it returns to its starting point?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with kinematics. The electric field exerts a force on the electron, producing acceleration opposite to its initial velocity. We find the acceleration from $$F = eE = ma$$, then use kinematic equations to find distance and time. Since the electron is negative and the force opposes its motion, we determine the field direction from this.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Initial velocity: $$v_0 = 5.00 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$$
- Electric field magnitude: $$E = 2.00 \times 10^5 \text{ N/C}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge magnitude: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a)** The electron is negative, and the force opposes its initial velocity (slowing it down). For a negative charge, the force is opposite to the field direction: $$\vec{F} = -e\vec{E}$$. If the force opposes the velocity, the field must be **in the same direction as the initial velocity**.

**(b)** First, find the acceleration:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = eE = m_e a$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{eE}{m_e} = \frac{(1.60 \times 10^{-19})(2.00 \times 10^5)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{3.20 \times 10^{-14}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = 3.51 \times 10^{16} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

This acceleration is opposite to the velocity (deceleration). Using $$v^2 = v_0^2 - 2ad$$ where $$v = 0$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$0 = v_0^2 - 2ad$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d = \frac{v_0^2}{2a} = \frac{(5.00 \times 10^6)^2}{2(3.51 \times 10^{16})}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$d = \frac{2.50 \times 10^{13}}{7.02 \times 10^{16}} = 3.56 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} = 0.356 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**(c)** Using $$v = v_0 - at$$ where $$v = 0$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{v_0}{a} = \frac{5.00 \times 10^6}{3.51 \times 10^{16}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$t = 1.42 \times 10^{-10} \text{ s} = 0.142 \text{ ns}$$
</div>

**(d)** After coming to rest, the electron continues to accelerate in the opposite direction (back toward the starting point). By symmetry, when it returns to the starting point, it will have the same kinetic energy (and thus speed) as initially, but in the opposite direction:

<div class="equation">
 $$v = -5.00 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

(The magnitude is $$5.00 \times 10^6$$ m/s, direction opposite to initial velocity.)

**Discussion**

Part (a): The field points in the same direction as the electron's initial velocity. This seems counterintuitive until you remember that electrons are negative—they experience forces opposite to the field direction.

Part (b): The electron travels only 0.356 mm before coming to rest. Despite its high initial speed, the enormous acceleration ($$10^{16} \text{ m/s}^2$$) brings it to rest very quickly and over a short distance.

Part (c): The time of 0.142 nanoseconds is extremely brief, consistent with the large deceleration.

Part (d): The electron's velocity when returning is $$5.00 \times 10^6$$ m/s in the opposite direction. This makes sense from energy conservation—the electric field does negative work slowing the electron, then positive work speeding it back up. When it returns to the starting point, it has regained all its kinetic energy.

This problem demonstrates how uniform electric fields can be used to control charged particle motion, as in oscilloscopes and particle accelerators. The symmetry of the motion (same speed at the starting point) is a consequence of the conservation of energy in a conservative field.

The practical limit to an electric field in air is about $$3.00 \times 10^{6}

starting from rest. (b) Is this practical in air, or must it occur in a vacuum?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with kinematics. The electric field accelerates the proton from rest. We find the acceleration from $$a = \frac{eE}{m_p}$$, then use $$v^2 = 2ad$$ to find the distance needed to reach $$v = 0.03c$$. We then compare this distance to practical constraints.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Electric field: $$E = 3.00 \times 10^6 \text{ N/C}$$
- Target velocity: $$v = 0.0300c = 0.0300(3.00 \times 10^8) = 9.00 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$$
- Proton mass: $$m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$$
- Proton charge: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a)** The acceleration of the proton:

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{eE}{m_p} = \frac{(1.60 \times 10^{-19})(3.00 \times 10^6)}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{4.80 \times 10^{-13}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} = 2.87 \times 10^{14} \text{ m/s}^2$$

Using $$v^2 = 2ad$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$d = \frac{v^2}{2a} = \frac{(9.00 \times 10^6)^2}{2(2.87 \times 10^{14})}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$d = \frac{8.10 \times 10^{13}}{5.74 \times 10^{14}} = 0.141 \text{ m} = 14.1 \text{ cm}$$
</div>

**(b)** This is **not practical in air**. The distance of 14.1 cm is substantial, and maintaining such a high electric field (at the breakdown limit) over this distance in air would cause ionization and sparking. The field would be reduced as the air becomes conducting. This acceleration **must occur in a vacuum** where there are no air molecules to ionize. Particle accelerators that achieve such energies use evacuated tubes to avoid this problem.

**Discussion**

Part (a): A proton needs to travel only 14.1 cm in a field of $$3.00 \times 10^6$$ N/C to reach 3% of the speed of light. This relatively short distance demonstrates the effectiveness of electric fields for particle acceleration, which is why they're used in particle accelerators.

Part (b): However, this cannot be done in air. At $$3.00 \times 10^6$$ N/C, air is at its breakdown threshold—any sparking would create conducting paths that would short out the field. Real particle accelerators solve this by operating in vacuum chambers. Additionally, even in vacuum, generating and maintaining such a strong uniform field over 14 cm requires sophisticated electrode design.

The time required for this acceleration would be $$t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{9.00 \times 10^6}{2.87 \times 10^{14}} \approx 31.4$$ nanoseconds, which is very brief. This problem illustrates the practical challenges of particle acceleration and why modern accelerators require both high vacuum and careful engineering to achieve high energies.

A 5.00 g charged insulating ball hangs on a 30.0 cm long string in a uniform

{: #Figure7}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with statics and torque. The ball is in equilibrium under three forces: tension, weight, and electric force. We can use force balance or torque balance. Using forces: the horizontal component is $$F_e = qE$$ and the vertical component is $$T\cos\theta = mg$$. The ratio $$\tan\theta = \frac{F_e}{mg}$$ allows us to solve for $$E$$.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Mass: $$m = 5.00 \text{ g} = 5.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg}$$
- Charge: $$q = 1.00 \mu\text{C} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$$
- Angle: $$\theta = 8.00°$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$

The ball is in equilibrium, so the net force is zero. Analyzing forces:

**Vertical equilibrium:**

<div class="equation">
 $$T\cos\theta = mg$$
</div>

**Horizontal equilibrium:**

<div class="equation">
 $$T\sin\theta = F_e = qE$$
</div>

Dividing these equations:

<div class="equation">
 $$\tan\theta = \frac{qE}{mg}$$
</div>

Solving for $$E$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{mg\tan\theta}{q}$$
</div>

Substituting values:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{(5.00 \times 10^{-3})(9.80)\tan(8.00°)}{1.00 \times 10^{-6}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{(4.90 \times 10^{-2})(0.1405)}{1.00 \times 10^{-6}}$$

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{6.88 \times 10^{-3}}{1.00 \times 10^{-6}} = 6.88 \times 10^{3} \text{ N/C} = 6.88 \text{ kN/C}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The electric field strength is $$6.88 \times 10^3$$ N/C or 6.88 kN/C. This is a moderate field strength—much weaker than the breakdown field in air ($$3 \times 10^6$$ N/C) but much stronger than Earth's atmospheric field (150 N/C).

The relatively small deflection angle of 8.00° tells us the electric force is much smaller than the gravitational force. This makes sense: $$F_e = qE = (1.00 \times 10^{-6})(6.88 \times 10^3) = 6.88 \times 10^{-3}$$ N, while $$F_g = mg = 4.90 \times 10^{-2}$$ N. The electric force is about 14% of the weight, producing a tan(8°) ≈ 0.14 ratio.

This problem demonstrates equilibrium under multiple forces and shows how even modest electric fields can produce observable effects on charged objects. The setup is similar to Millikan's oil drop experiment, though that used vertical rather than horizontal fields. Such configurations are used to measure charges and fields in laboratory settings.

- Electric field: $$E = 100 \text{ N/C}$$ (vertical)
- Initial horizontal velocity: $$v_x = 3.00 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$$
- Horizontal distance: $$x = 4.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0400 \text{ m}$$
- Electron mass: $$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
- Electron charge: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**Step 1:** Find the vertical acceleration.

<div class="equation">
 $$a_y = \frac{eE}{m_e} = \frac{(1.60 \times 10^{-19})(100)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$a_y = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{-17}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = 1.76 \times 10^{13} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

**Step 2:** Find the time in the field.

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{x}{v_x} = \frac{0.0400}{3.00 \times 10^6} = 1.33 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}$$
</div>

**(a)** Find the vertical deflection using $$y = \frac{1}{2}a_y t^2$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$y = \frac{1}{2}(1.76 \times 10^{13})(1.33 \times 10^{-8})^2$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$y = \frac{1}{2}(1.76 \times 10^{13})(1.78 \times 10^{-16})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$y = 1.56 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} = 1.56 \text{ mm}$$
</div>

**(b)** Find the vertical velocity component using $$v_y = a_y t$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$v_y = (1.76 \times 10^{13})(1.33 \times 10^{-8})$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$v_y = 2.34 \times 10^{5} \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**(c)** Find the exit angle:

<div class="equation">
 $$\tan\theta = \frac{v_y}{v_x} = \frac{2.34 \times 10^5}{3.00 \times 10^6} = 0.0780$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = \arctan(0.0780) = 4.46°$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The vertical deflection is 1.56 mm. This small deflection over a 4.00 cm horizontal distance demonstrates that the electric field modestly alters the electron's trajectory without drastically changing its path.

Part (b): The vertical velocity component is $$2.34 \times 10^5$$ m/s, which is about 7.8% of the horizontal velocity. The electron maintains most of its original horizontal motion while gaining a relatively small vertical component.

Part (c): The exit angle is 4.46°. This matches the velocity ratio: $$\tan(4.46°) \approx 0.078$$.

This configuration is exactly how cathode ray oscilloscopes work—pairs of deflection plates use perpendicular electric fields to steer the electron beam horizontally and vertically, allowing it to trace waveforms on a phosphor screen. The small deflection angle and modest field strength (100 N/C is quite weak) show that even gentle electric fields can effectively control fast-moving electrons due to their tiny mass. Modern oscilloscopes have largely been replaced by digital versions, but the underlying principle remains important in electron optics and beam control systems.

**Integrated Concepts**

The classic Millikan oil drop experiment was the first to obtain an accurate
measurement of the charge on an electron. In it, oil drops were suspended
against the gravitational force by a vertical electric field. (
See [[Figure 9]](#Figure9).) Given the oil drop to be $$1.00 \mu \text{m} $$ in
radius and have a density of $$920 kg/{m}^{3} $$:
(a) Find the weight of the drop.
(b) If the drop has a single excess electron, find the electric field strength needed to balance its weight.

![Two parallel conducting plates with opposite charges are shown and the electric field lines are emerging from the positive plate and entering the negative plate. These lines are parallel between the plates and a charged particle is in between the plates. An observer is watching it through a microscope.](../resources/Figure_18_08_11.jpg 'In the Millikan oil drop experiment, small drops can be suspended in an electric field by the force exerted on a single excess electron. Classically, this experiment was used to determine the electron charge qe by measuring the electric field and mass of the drop.')
{: #Figure9}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with fluid statics and statics. For part (a), we find the mass from the volume and density, then calculate weight. For part (b), we set the electric force equal to the weight and solve for the electric field.

**Solution**

Given values:
- Radius: $$r = 1.00 \mu\text{m} = 1.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$$
- Density: $$\rho = 920 \text{ kg/m}^3$$
- Gravitational acceleration: $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$
- Electron charge: $$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

**(a)** Find the volume of the spherical drop:

<div class="equation">
 $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi(1.00 \times 10^{-6})^3$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(1.00 \times 10^{-18}) = 4.19 \times 10^{-18} \text{ m}^3$$
</div>

Find the mass:

<div class="equation">
 $$m = \rho V = (920)(4.19 \times 10^{-18}) = 3.85 \times 10^{-15} \text{ kg}$$
</div>

Find the weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$w = mg = (3.85 \times 10^{-15})(9.80) = 3.77 \times 10^{-14} \text{ N}$$
</div>

**(b)** For the drop to be suspended, the upward electric force must equal the downward weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_e = w$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$eE = mg$$
</div>

Solving for $$E$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{mg}{e} = \frac{3.77 \times 10^{-14}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = 2.36 \times 10^{5} \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Part (a): The weight of the oil drop is $$3.77 \times 10^{-14}$$ N, which is extremely small. This tiny weight corresponds to a mass of about 3.85 femtograms ($$10^{-15}$$ kg). Despite being microscopic, such drops are large enough to observe under a microscope, making them ideal for Millikan's experiment.

Part (b): The electric field needed is $$2.36 \times 10^5$$ N/C or 236 kN/C. This is a strong but achievable laboratory field—much less than air's breakdown threshold ($$3 \times 10^6$$ N/C). The field can be created by applying a modest voltage across closely spaced parallel plates.

Millikan's brilliance was in realizing that by measuring the field required to suspend drops and the drops' masses, he could determine the fundamental charge $$e$$. By observing many drops with different numbers of excess electrons, he found that all charges were integer multiples of a fundamental unit, confirming charge quantization. The experiment typically used drops with radii of 1-2 μm because smaller drops are affected too much by air currents while larger drops require impractically strong fields.

This experiment was crucial in establishing the electron's charge as a fundamental constant and earned Millikan the 1923 Nobel Prize. The principle—balancing gravitational and electric forces—remains a cornerstone technique in modern experiments that manipulate individual charged particles.

**Integrated Concepts**

(a) In [[Figure 10]](#Figure10), four equal charges $$q $$ lie on the corners of
a square. A fifth charge $$Q $$ is on a mass $$m $$ directly above the center of
the square, at a height equal to the length $$d $$ of one side of the square.
Determine the magnitude of $$q $$ in terms of $$Q $$ , $$m $$ , and $$d $$ , if
the Coulomb force is to equal the weight of $$m $$ .
(b) Is this equilibrium stable or unstable? Discuss.

![Four charged particles each having same magnitude q are placed at the corner of a parallelogram. The sides have length d and fifth charge Q is at a distance d above the plane of intersection of the diagonal of this parallelogram.](../resources/Figure_18_08_12.jpg 'Four equal charges on the corners of a horizontal square support the weight of a fifth charge located directly above the center of the square.')
{: #Figure10}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This problem combines electrostatics with statics. The four corner charges each exert a force on the central charge $$Q$$. By symmetry, the horizontal components cancel, leaving only vertical components. We set the total upward electrostatic force equal to the weight and solve for $$q$$. For part (b), we analyze whether small displacements result in restoring or amplifying forces.

**Solution**

**(a)** First, find the distance from each corner charge to $$Q$$.

The diagonal of a square with side $$d$$ is $$\sqrt{2}d$$, so the distance from the center to a corner is $$\frac{\sqrt{2}d}{2} = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$$.

The distance from a corner charge to $$Q$$ (using Pythagorean theorem):

<div class="equation">
 $$r = \sqrt{\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + d^2} = \sqrt{\frac{d^2}{2} + d^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3d^2}{2}} = d\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$$
</div>

The force from one corner charge on $$Q$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{one}} = k\frac{qQ}{r^2} = k\frac{qQ}{3d^2/2} = \frac{2kqQ}{3d^2}$$
</div>

The vertical component of this force (angle $$\theta$$ from vertical where $$\cos\theta = \frac{d}{r}$$):

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{vertical}} = F_{\text{one}}\cos\theta = \frac{2kqQ}{3d^2} \cdot \frac{d}{d\sqrt{3/2}} = \frac{2kqQ}{3d^2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{2kqQ\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{3}d^2}$$
</div>

Total upward force from all four charges:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{total}} = 4F_{\text{vertical}} = \frac{8kqQ\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{3}d^2} = \frac{8kqQ}{3\sqrt{6}d^2}$$
</div>

Setting this equal to the weight:

<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{8kqQ}{3\sqrt{6}d^2} = mg$$
</div>

Solving for $$q$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \frac{3\sqrt{6}mgd^2}{8kQ}$$
</div>

**(b)** This equilibrium is **unstable** in the vertical direction. If $$Q$$ is displaced slightly upward, the electrostatic forces decrease (inverse square law), so weight dominates and pulls it back. However, if displaced downward, the electrostatic forces increase and can't restore it—gravity pulls it further down. Additionally, any horizontal displacement leads to a net horizontal force away from center (no restoring force), making the equilibrium unstable laterally as well.

**Discussion**

Part (a): The required charge on each corner is $$q = \frac{3\sqrt{6}mgd^2}{8kQ}$$. This expression shows that $$q$$ is proportional to the mass (heavier objects need stronger electrostatic support), proportional to $$d^2$$ (larger separation requires more charge to compensate for weaker fields), and inversely proportional to $$Q$$ (larger central charge experiences stronger forces from given corner charges).

Part (b): While this configuration can theoretically support the weight, it's unstable—any perturbation grows rather than diminishes. This is similar to balancing a ball on top of a hill. In practice, such a levitation system would require active feedback control to maintain stability, making it impractical for passive levitation.

**Unreasonable Results**

(a) Calculate the electric field strength near a 10.0 cm diameter conducting
sphere that has 1.00 C of excess charge on it. (b) What is unreasonable about
this result? (c) Which assumptions are responsible?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For a conducting sphere, the electric field at the surface can be calculated using $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2}$$ where $$r$$ is the radius. We then assess whether this field is physically reasonable.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$q = 1.00 \text{ C}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{diameter} = 10.0 \text{ cm} \Rightarrow r = 5.00 \text{ cm} = 0.0500 \text{ m}$$
</div>

The electric field at the surface:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)(1.00 \text{ C})}{(0.0500 \text{ m})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{8.99 \times 10^9}{2.50 \times 10^{-3}} = 3.60 \times 10^{12} \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

**(b)** This result is unreasonable because:
- The field strength is about one million times greater than the breakdown field of air ($$\approx 3 \times 10^6$$ N/C)
- At this field strength, air would violently ionize, creating conducting paths
- The charge would immediately leak away through electrical breakdown and corona discharge
- Such a field far exceeds anything achievable in laboratory conditions

**(c)** The unreasonable assumption is that **1.00 C of charge can be placed on a 10 cm sphere**. This is an impossibly large charge for such a small object. In reality:
- Typical static charges are in the nanocoulomb to microcoulomb range
- Even Van de Graaff generators rarely exceed millicoulombs
- Long before reaching 1 C, the sphere would discharge through air breakdown

**Discussion**

The calculated field of $$3.60 \times 10^{12}$$ N/C is about a million times the breakdown threshold of air. This illustrates why 1 coulomb is such an enormous unit for static electricity. The coulomb is convenient for describing currents (where many coulombs flow per second), but for static charge, practical units are the nanocoulomb (nC) and microcoulomb (μC). This problem demonstrates the importance of checking whether results are physically reasonable and understanding the practical limits of electrostatic phenomena.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's law, then find the acceleration using Newton's second law. We then assess whether the result is physically reasonable for raindrops.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$m = 0.500 \text{ g} = 5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q_1 = q_2 = 1.00 \text{ mC} = 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ C}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$r = 1.00 \text{ cm} = 1.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$$
</div>

The electrostatic force:

<div class="equation">
 $$F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(1.00 \times 10^{-3})^2}{(1.00 \times 10^{-2})^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$F = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(1.00 \times 10^{-6})}{1.00 \times 10^{-4}} = 8.99 \times 10^7 \text{ N}$$
</div>

The acceleration:

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{8.99 \times 10^7 \text{ N}}{5.00 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg}} = 1.80 \times 10^{11} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

**(b)** This result is absurdly unreasonable:
- The acceleration is about $$10^{10}$$ times Earth's gravitational acceleration
- At this acceleration for even a microsecond, the drops would reach relativistic speeds
- The drops would be torn apart by such enormous forces
- This acceleration is physically impossible for macroscopic objects

**(c)** The unreasonable assumption is that **each raindrop carries 1.00 mC of charge**. This is an impossibly large charge for a raindrop:
- Raindrops in thunderstorms typically carry picocoulombs to nanocoulombs
- 1 mC is a million times larger than typical atmospheric charges
- Water is a good conductor, making it very difficult to maintain such high charge densities
- The drops would discharge through the surrounding air long before reaching 1 mC

**Discussion**

The calculated acceleration of $$1.80 \times 10^{11} \text{ m/s}^2$$ is nonsensical. For comparison, typical accelerations in everyday life range from $$1-100 \text{ m/s}^2$$, and even extreme accelerations (like explosions) rarely exceed $$10^5 \text{ m/s}^2$$. An acceleration of $$10^{11} \text{ m/s}^2$$ would accelerate the drop to the speed of light in about 3 microseconds, violating special relativity.

In real thunderstorms, raindrops acquire charges of about 1-100 pC (picocoulombs), which is about 10 million times smaller than the 1 mC assumed in this problem. This creates manageable forces and explains why raindrops don't fly apart despite the electrical activity in thunderstorms. This problem illustrates the importance of using realistic charge values when analyzing electrostatic situations.

**Unreasonable Results**

A wrecking yard inventor wants to pick up cars by charging a 0.400 m diameter

kg mass and the ball is to be able to lift it from a distance of 1.00 m: (a)
What minimum charge must be used? (b) What is the electric field near the
surface of the ball? (c) Why are these results unreasonable? (d) Which premise
or assumption is responsible?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), the electrostatic force must equal the car's weight, so we use $$k\frac{q^2}{r^2} = mg$$ and solve for $$q$$. For part (b), we calculate the field at the ball's surface using $$E = k\frac{q}{R^2}$$ where $$R$$ is the ball's radius. We then assess the physical reasonableness.

**Solution**

**(a)** Given values:

<div class="equation">
 $$m = 1000 \text{ kg}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$r = 1.00 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$g = 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

The required charge:

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{q^2}{r^2} = mg$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q = r\sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} = (1.00 \text{ m})\sqrt{\frac{(1000 \text{ kg})(9.80 \text{ m/s}^2)}{8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2}}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$q = \sqrt{\frac{9800}{8.99 \times 10^9}} = \sqrt{1.09 \times 10^{-6}} = 1.04 \times 10^{-3} \text{ C} = 1.04 \text{ mC}$$
</div>

**(b)** The ball's radius is $$R = 0.200 \text{ m}$$. The electric field at its surface:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = k\frac{q}{R^2} = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(1.04 \times 10^{-3})}{(0.200)^2}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{9.35 \times 10^6}{0.0400} = 2.34 \times 10^8 \text{ N/C}$$
</div>

**(c)** These results are unreasonable because:
- The electric field ($$2.34 \times 10^8$$ N/C) is about 80 times the breakdown field of air ($$3 \times 10^6$$ N/C)
- The ball would experience violent corona discharge and arcing
- The charge (1.04 mC) cannot be maintained on the ball—it would immediately leak away
- The induced charge on the car assumes it acts as a perfect conductor, which is unrealistic
- Any practical attempt would result in spectacular electrical breakdown and sparking

**(d)** The unreasonable assumptions are:
- That such a large charge (1 mC) can be maintained on a 40 cm ball in air
- That the car can be induced with an equal opposite charge
- That the separation distance (1 m) is enough to prevent breakdown with such high fields
- Ignoring air breakdown limitations

**Discussion**

While the calculation correctly determines that 1.04 mC would provide sufficient force, this is completely impractical. The electric field at the ball's surface is nearly 100 times air's breakdown threshold. In reality, long before reaching this charge, the air would ionize, creating conducting paths for charge to escape. Additionally, the induced charge distribution on the car would be non-uniform and incomplete, reducing the actual force.

This problem illustrates why electromagnetic cranes don't use electrostatic forces—they use magnetic forces instead. Magnetic fields can be made very strong without the breakdown issues that plague electrostatics in air. The fundamental limitation here is air breakdown, which caps practical electric fields at about $$3 \times 10^6$$ N/C. Any scheme involving higher fields must operate in vacuum or use other insulating media, making it impractical for a wrecking yard application.

the centers of the balls and extending to infinity on either side. Choose
interesting points and comment on the meaning of the field at those points. For

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Guidance for Constructing This Problem**

When constructing this problem, consider the following framework:

**Choose Your Parameters:**
- Select reasonable charge magnitudes (e.g., ±10 μC on each ball)
- Choose ball radii (e.g., 5 cm) and separation distance (e.g., 30 cm between centers)
- Ensure the balls don't overlap

**Interesting Points to Analyze:**

1. **Midpoint between balls**: The fields from each charge point in the same direction here (both toward the negative charge), creating a maximum field point

2. **Just outside each ball**: Calculate the field very close to each surface—should approach that of a point charge at the center

3. **Far from both balls** (e.g., 10× the separation distance): The fields nearly cancel since the balls appear as a dipole from far away; field falls off as $$1/r^3$$ (dipole field) rather than $$1/r^2$$

4. **Between the balls but offset from center**: Explore how the field varies as you move along the axis

**Analysis to Include:**
- Calculate $$E = k\frac{q}{r^2}$$ for each ball at your chosen points
- Use vector addition to find the net field
- Discuss the direction (toward negative charge) and magnitude
- Explain why the field behaves differently at different locations
- Consider the transition from near-field (where individual charges dominate) to far-field (dipole behavior)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Guidance for Constructing This Problem**

When constructing this problem, follow this framework:

**Choose Your Parameters:**
- Select spacecraft mass (e.g., $$m = 10,000$$ kg each)
- Choose separation distance $$r$$ (e.g., 100 m)
- The radius of the ships is not critical for point-charge approximation

**Set Up the Balance Condition:**

The gravitational attraction is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_g = G\frac{m^2}{r^2}$$
</div>

The electrostatic repulsion is:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_e = k\frac{q^2}{r^2}$$
</div>

For balance: $$F_e = F_g$$, so:

<div class="equation">
 $$k\frac{q^2}{r^2} = G\frac{m^2}{r^2}$$
</div>

**Solve for Charge:**

<div class="equation">
 $$q = m\sqrt{\frac{G}{k}}$$
</div>

**Key Insights to Discuss:**

1. **Distance Independence**: Notice that $$r$$ cancels out! The required charge doesn't depend on separation distance (both forces follow $$1/r^2$$)

2. **Mass Dependence**: The charge needed is directly proportional to mass

3. **The Ratio $$\sqrt{G/k}$$**: Calculate this fundamental constant:
   $$\sqrt{\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11}}{8.99 \times 10^9}} \approx 8.61 \times 10^{-11}$$ C/kg

4. **For your chosen mass**: $$q = (10,000)(8.61 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 8.61 \times 10^{-7}$$ C = 0.861 μC

**Practical Considerations:**

- **Feasibility**: The charge (< 1 μC) is small and achievable
- **Challenges**: Maintaining precise equal charges on both ships is difficult; any imbalance creates net attraction or repulsion
- **Stability**: The equilibrium is neutral (not self-correcting)—any drift causes problems
- **Charge leakage**: In practice, charges leak away over time
- **Would require active control** to maintain the balance

Conclude that while theoretically possible, practical implementation would be challenging and require continuous charge management.
