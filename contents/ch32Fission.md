**Nuclear fission** is a reaction in which a nucleus is split (or *fissured*).
Controlled fission is a reality, whereas controlled fusion is a hope for the
future. Hundreds of nuclear fission power plants around the world attest to the
fact that controlled fission is practical and, at least in the short term,
economical, as seen in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Whereas nuclear power was of
little interest for decades following TMI and Chernobyl (and now Fukushima
Daiichi), growing concerns over global warming has brought nuclear power back on
the table as a viable energy alternative. By the end of 2009, there were 442
reactors operating in 30 countries, providing 15% of the world’s electricity.
France provides over 75% of its electricity with nuclear power, while the US has
104 operating reactors providing 20% of its electricity. Australia and New
Zealand have none. China is building nuclear power plants at the rate of one
start every month.

![The image shows people living in their homes located near a nuclear power plant.](../resources/Figure_32_06_01a.jpg "The people living near this nuclear power plant have no measurable exposure to radiation that is traceable to the plant. About 16% of the world&#x2019;s electrical power is generated by controlled nuclear fission in such plants. The cooling towers are the most prominent features but are not unique to nuclear power. The reactor is in the small domed building to the left of the towers. (credit: Kalmthouts)")
{ #Figure1}

Fission is the opposite of fusion and releases energy only when heavy nuclei are
split. As noted in [Fusion](../contents/ch32Fusion), energy is released if the products of a
nuclear reaction have a greater binding energy per nucleon ( $$\text{BE}/A $$ )
than the parent nuclei. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows that $$\text{BE}/A $$ is
greater for medium-mass nuclei than heavy nuclei, implying that when a heavy
nucleus is split, the products have less mass per nucleon, so that mass is
destroyed and energy is released in the reaction. The amount of energy per
fission reaction can be large, even by nuclear standards. The graph
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows $$\text{BE}/A $$ to be about 7.6 MeV/nucleon for
the heaviest nuclei ( $$A $$ about 240), while $$\text{BE}/A $$ is about 8.6
MeV/nucleon for nuclei having $$A $$ about 120. Thus, if a heavy nucleus splits
in half, then about 1 MeV per nucleon, or approximately 240 MeV per fission, is
released. This is about 10 times the energy per fusion reaction, and about 100
times the energy of the average $$\alpha $$ , $$\beta $$ , or $$\gamma $$ decay.

Calculating Energy Released by Fission
</div>
Calculate the energy released in the following spontaneous fission reaction:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{238}\text{U}\to {}^{95}\text{Sr}+{}^{140}\text{Xe}+3n $$
</div>
given the atomic masses to be  $$m\left({}^{238}\text{U}\right)=238.050784 \text{u} $$ ,
  $$m\left({}^{95}\text{Sr}\right)=94.919388 \text{u} $$ ,
  $$m\left({}^{140}\text{Xe}\right)=139.921610 \text{u} $$ ,
 and  $$m\left(n\right)=1.008665 \text{u} $$.

**Strategy**

As always, the energy released is equal to the mass destroyed times $${c}^{2} $$
, so we must find the difference in mass between the parent $${}^{238}\text{U}
$$ and the fission products.

**Solution**

The products have a total mass of

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{m}_{\text{products}}& =& 94.919388 \text{u}+139.921610 \text{u}+3\left(1.008665 u\right)\\ & =&  237.866993 \text{u} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
The mass lost is the mass of  $${}^{238}\text{U} $$
 minus  $${m}_{\text{products}} $$, or 
<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta m=238.050784 \text{u}-237.8669933 \text{u}=0.183791 u, $$
</div>
so the energy released is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}E& =& \left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2}\\ & =& \left(0.183791 \text{u}\right)\frac{931.5 \text{Me}\text{V/}{c}^{2}}{\text{u}}{c}^{2}=171.2 \text{MeV} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A number of important things arise in this example. The 171-MeV energy released
is large, but a little less than the earlier estimated 240 MeV. This is because
this fission reaction produces neutrons and does not split the nucleus into two
equal parts. Fission of a given nuclide, such as $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ , does
not always produce the same products. Fission is a statistical process in which
an entire range of products are produced with various probabilities. Most
fission produces neutrons, although the number varies with each fission. This is
an extremely important aspect of fission, because *neutrons can induce more
fission*, enabling self-sustaining chain reactions.

</div>

Spontaneous fission can occur, but this is usually not the most common decay
mode for a given nuclide. For example, $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ can spontaneously
fission, but it decays mostly by $$\alpha $$ emission. Neutron-induced fission
is crucial as seen in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Being chargeless, even low-energy
neutrons can strike a nucleus and be absorbed once they feel the attractive
nuclear force. Large nuclei are described by a **liquid drop model** with
surface tension and oscillation modes, because the large number of nucleons act
like atoms in a drop. The neutron is attracted and thus, deposits energy,
causing the nucleus to deform as a liquid drop. If stretched enough, the nucleus
narrows in the middle. The number of nucleons in contact and the strength of the
nuclear force binding the nucleus together are reduced. Coulomb repulsion
between the two ends then succeeds in fissioning the nucleus, which pops like a
water drop into two large pieces and a few neutrons. **Neutron-induced fission**
can be written as

<div class="equation" >
 $$n+{ }^{A}\text{X}\to {\text{FF}}_{1}+{\text{FF}}_{2}+\text{xn}, $$
</div>

where $${\text{FF}}_{1} $$ and $${\text{FF}}_{2} $$ are the two daughter nuclei,
called **fission fragments**, and $$x $$ is the number of neutrons produced.
Most often, the masses of the fission fragments are not the same. Most of the
released energy goes into the kinetic energy of the fission fragments, with the
remainder going into the neutrons and excited states of the fragments. Since
neutrons can induce fission, a self-sustaining chain reaction is possible,
provided more than one neutron is produced on average — that is, if $$x>1 $$ in
$$n+{}^{A}\text{X}\to {\text{FF}}_{1}+{\text{FF}}_{2}+\text{xn} $$ . This can
also be seen in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

An example of a typical neutron-induced fission reaction is

<div class="equation" >
 $$n+{}_{92}^{235}\text{U}\to {}_{56}^{142}\text{Ba}+{}_{36}^{91}\text{Kr}+3\mathrm{n.} $$
</div>

Note that in this equation, the total charge remains the same (is conserved):
$$92+0=56+36 $$ . Also, as far as whole numbers are concerned, the mass is
constant:  $$1+235=142+91+3 $$ . This is not true when we consider the masses
out to 6 or 7 significant places, as in the previous example.

![A neutron gets absorbed in a nucleus, making it narrower in the middle, then finally breaking into two parts and ejecting some neutrons.](../resources/Figure_32_06_02a.jpg "Neutron-induced fission is shown. First, energy is put into this large nucleus when it absorbs a neutron. Acting like a struck liquid drop, the nucleus deforms and begins to narrow in the middle. Since fewer nucleons are in contact, the repulsive Coulomb force is able to break the nucleus into two parts with some neutrons also flying away.")
{ #Figure2}

![A uranium nucleus struck by a neutron produces two fragments and three neutrons, two of which continue to strike two other uranium nuclei and hence, initiate a chain reaction.](../resources/Figure_32_06_03a.jpg "A chain reaction can produce self-sustained fission if each fission produces enough neutrons to induce at least one more fission. This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average fission and how easy it is to make a particular type of nuclide fission.")
{ #Figure3}

Not every neutron produced by fission induces fission. Some neutrons escape the
fissionable material, while others interact with a nucleus without making it
fission. We can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a
large amount of fissionable material. The minimum amount necessary for
self-sustained fission of a given nuclide is called its **critical mass**. Some
nuclides, such as $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ , produce more neutrons per fission
than others, such as $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ . Additionally, some nuclides are
easier to make fission than others. In particular, $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ and
$${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ are easier to fission than the much more abundant
$${}^{238}\text{U} $$ . Both factors affect critical mass, which is smallest for
$${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ .

The reason $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ and $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ are easier to
fission than $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ is that the nuclear force is more attractive
for an even number of neutrons in a nucleus than for an odd number. Consider
that $${}_{92}^{235}{\text{U}}_{143} $$ has 143 neutrons, and $${}_
{94}^{239}{\text{P}}_{145} $$ has 145 neutrons, whereas $${}_
{92}^{238}{\text{U}}_{146} $$ has 146. When a neutron encounters a nucleus with
an odd number of neutrons, the nuclear force is more attractive, because the
additional neutron will make the number even. About 2-MeV more energy is
deposited in the resulting nucleus than would be the case if the number of
neutrons was already even. This extra energy produces greater deformation,
making fission more likely. Thus, $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ and $${}^{239}\text{Pu}
$$ are superior fission fuels. The isotope $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ is only 0.72 %
of natural uranium, while $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ is 99.27%, and
$${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ does not exist in nature. Australia has the largest
deposits of uranium in the world, standing at 28% of the total. This is followed
by Kazakhstan and Canada. The US has only 3% of global reserves.

Most fission reactors utilize $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ , which is separated from
$${}^{238}\text{U} $$ at some expense. This is called enrichment. The most
common separation method is gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride (
$${\text{UF}}_{6} $$ )
through membranes. Since $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ has less mass than
$${}^{238}\text{U} $$ , its $${\text{UF}}_{6} $$ molecules have higher average
velocity at the same temperature and diffuse faster. Another interesting
characteristic of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ is that it preferentially absorbs very
slow moving neutrons (with energies a fraction of an eV), whereas fission
reactions produce fast neutrons with energies in the order of an MeV. To make a
self-sustained fission reactor with $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ , it is thus necessary
to slow down (“thermalize”) the neutrons. Water is very effective, since
neutrons collide with protons in water molecules and lose
energy. [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) shows a schematic of a reactor design, called the
pressurized water reactor.

![The figure shows a close-shielded vessel containing fuel rod and control rods along with a moderator in one chamber from which heat is taken out to the other chamber to change water to steam. Next, the steam is taken out from the vessel to run a turbine, and then it is condensed and sent back to the closed vessel.](../resources/Figure_32_06_04a.jpg "A pressurized water reactor is cleverly designed to control the fission of large amounts of \( {}^235\text{U}\) , while using the heat produced in the fission reaction to create steam for generating electrical energy. Control rods adjust neutron flux so that criticality is obtained, but not exceeded. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water away, the chain reaction terminates, because water is needed to thermalize the neutrons. This inherent safety feature can be overwhelmed in extreme circumstances. ")
{ #Figure4}

Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to
adjust neutron flux. To produce large power, reactors contain hundreds to
thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes
self-sustaining, a condition called **criticality**. Neutron flux should be
carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions, a condition
called **supercriticality**. Control rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even
a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is used to thermalize
neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ , and
achieve criticality, provides a negative feedback for temperature increases. In
case the reactor overheats and boils the water to steam or is breached, the
absence of water kills the chain reaction. Considerable heat, however, can still
be generated by the reactor’s radioactive fission products. Other safety
features, thus, need to be incorporated in the event of a *loss of coolant*
accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps.

Calculating Energy from a Kilogram of Fissionable Fuel
</div>
Calculate the amount of energy produced by the fission of 1.00 kg of  $${}^{235}\text{U} $$
 , given the average fission reaction of  $${}^{235}\text{U} $$
 produces 200 MeV.

**Strategy**

The total energy produced is the number of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ atoms times the
given energy per $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ fission. We should therefore find the
number of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ atoms in 1.00 kg.

**Solution**

The number of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ atoms in 1.00 kg is Avogadro’s number times
the number of moles. One mole of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ has a mass of 235.04 g;
thus, there are $$\left(1000 \text{g}\right)/\left(235.04 \text{g/mol}\right)
=4.25 \text{mol} $$ . The number of $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ atoms is therefore,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\left(4.25 mol\right)\left( 6.02 \times 10^{23}  {}^{235}\text{U/mol}\right)= 2.56 \times 10^{24}  {}^{235}\text{U}. $$
</div>
So the total energy released is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}E& =& \left( 2.56 \times 10^{24}  {}^{235}\text{U}\right)\left(\frac{200 \text{MeV}}{ {}^{235}\text{U}}\right)\left(\frac{ 1.60 \times 10^{-13}  \text{J}}{\text{MeV}}\right)\\ & =&   8.21 \times 10^{13}  \text{J}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is another impressively large amount of energy, equivalent to about 14 000
barrels of crude oil or 600 000 gallons of gasoline. But, it is only one-fourth
the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram mixture of deuterium and tritium
as seen in [[Example 1]](../contents/ch32Fusion#Example1). Even though each fission reaction
yields about ten times the energy of a fusion reaction, the energy per kilogram
of fission fuel is less, because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the
heavy nuclides. Fission fuel is also much more scarce than fusion fuel, and less
than 1% of uranium $$ \left( \text{the} {}^{235}\text{U} \right) $$ is readily
usable.

</div>

One nuclide already mentioned is $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ , which has a 24 120-y
half-life and does not exist in nature. Plutonium-239 is manufactured from
$${}^{238}\text{U} $$ in reactors, and it provides an opportunity to utilize the
other 99% of natural uranium as an energy source. The following reaction
sequence, called **breeding**, produces $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$. Breeding begins
with neutron capture by $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{238}\text{U}+n\to {}^{239}\text{U}+\gamma . $$
</div>

Uranium-239 then $${\beta }^{-} $$ decays:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{239}\text{U}\to {}^{239}\text{Np}+{\beta }^{-}+{}_{e}  \left( t_{1 \text{/2}}=23 \text{min} \right) \text{.}$$
</div>

Neptunium-239 also $${\beta }^{-} $$ decays:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{239}\text{Np}\to {}^{239}\text{Pu}+{\beta }^{-}+{\nu}_{e}  \left( t_{1 \text{/2}}= 2.4 \text{d} \right) \text{.} $$
</div>

Plutonium-239 builds up in reactor fuel at a rate that depends on the
probability of neutron capture by $${}^{238}\text{U} $$
(all reactor fuel contains more $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ than $${}^{235}\text{U}
$$ )  . Reactors designed specifically to make plutonium are called **breeder
reactors**. They seem to be inherently more hazardous than conventional
reactors, but it remains unknown whether their hazards can be made economically
acceptable. The four reactors at Chernobyl, including the one that was
destroyed, were built to breed plutonium and produce electricity. These reactors
had a design that was significantly different from the pressurized water reactor
illustrated above.

Plutonium-239 has advantages over $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ as a reactor fuel — it
produces more neutrons per fission on average, and it is easier for a thermal
neutron to cause it to fission. It is also chemically different from uranium, so
it is inherently easier to separate from uranium ore. This means
$${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ has a particularly small critical mass, an advantage for
nuclear weapons.

### Section Summary

* Nuclear fission is a reaction in which a nucleus is split.
* Fission releases energy when heavy nuclei are split into medium-mass nuclei.
* Self-sustained fission is possible, because neutron-induced fission also
  produces neutrons that can induce other fissions, $$n+{}^{A}X\to {\text{FF}}_
  {1}+{\text{FF}}_{2}+\text{xn} $$ , where $${\text{FF}}_{1} $$ and
  $${\text{FF}}_{2} $$ are the two daughter nuclei, or fission fragments, and *x* is the number of neutrons produced.
* A minimum mass, called the critical mass, should be present to achieve
  criticality.
* More than a critical mass can produce supercriticality.
* The production of new or different isotopes (especially $${}^{239}\text{Pu}
  $$ )   by nuclear transformation is called breeding, and reactors designed for
  this purpose are called breeder reactors.
