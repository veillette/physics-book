**Friction** is a force that is around us all the time that opposes relative
motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move (which you have
discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice). While a common force, the
behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not completely
understood. We have to rely heavily on observations for whatever understandings
we can gain. However, we can still deal with its more elementary general
characteristics and understand the circumstances in which it behaves.

Friction
</div>
Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact.

</div>

One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the
contact surface between systems and always in a direction that opposes motion or
attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two systems are in
contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is
called **kinetic friction**. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding
on ice. But when objects are stationary, **static friction**
can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic
friction between the objects.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Kinetic Friction
</div>
If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction.

</div>

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor—you
may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that
the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in
the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the
crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion it is easier to
keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic
friction force is less than the static friction force. If you add mass to the
crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it
started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you
would find it to be easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you
might expect).

[Figure 1](#Figure1) is a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at
the interface between two objects. Close-up inspection of these surfaces shows
them to be rough. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a
crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of
the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. A considerable force can
be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are
pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force
is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between
the surface molecules of the two objects, which explain the dependence of
friction on the nature of the substances. Adhesion varies with substances in
contact and is a complicated aspect of surface physics. Once an object is
moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less
force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds,
friction is nearly independent of speed.

![The figure shows a crate on a flat surface, and a magnified view of a bottom corner of the crate and the supporting surface. The magnified view shows that there is roughness in the two surfaces in contact with each other. A black arrow points toward the right, away from the crate, and it is labeled as the direction of motion or attempted motion. A red arrow pointing toward the left is located near the bottom left corner of the crate, at the interface between that corner and the supporting surface. The red arrow is labeled as f, representing friction between the two surfaces in contact with each other.](../resources/Figure_05_01_01.jpg "Frictional forces, such as \( \vb{f} \) , always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. In order for the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks can skip along the bottom surface. Thus a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. Such adhesive forces also depend on the substances the surfaces are made of, explaining, for example, why rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles.")
{: #Figure1}

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (
static friction), the other for when there is motion (kinetic friction).

When there is no motion between the objects, the **magnitude of static
friction** , $$f_{s} $$ is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\s}\le \mu_{\s} \mag{N}, $$
</div>

where $$ \mu_{\s} $$ is the coefficient of static friction and $$ \mag{N}$$ is
the magnitude of the normal force (the force perpendicular to the surface).

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Magnitude of Static Friction
</div>
Magnitude of static friction force $$ f_{\s} $$ is

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\s}\le \mu_{\s} \mag{N}, $$
</div>
where $$ \mu_{\s} $$ is the coefficient of static friction and $$ \mag{N} $$
is the magnitude of the normal force.

</div>

The symbol $$ \le $$ means *less than or equal to*, implying that static
friction can have a minimum and a maximum value of $$ \mu_{\s}\mag{N} $$. Static
friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to
whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force
exceeds $$ f_{\s \left(\text{max}\right)} $$, the object will move. Thus

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\s  \left(\text{max}\right)}=\mu_{\s} \mag{N} . $$
</div>

Once an object is moving, the **magnitude of kinetic friction** , $$ f_k $$ is
given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} , $$
</div>

where $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction. A system in
which $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} $$ is described as a system in
which *friction behaves simply*.

</div>

As seen in [Table 1](#Table1), the coefficients of kinetic friction are less
than their static counterparts. That values of $$ \mu $$ in [Table 1](#Table1)
are stated to only one or, at most, two digits is an indication of the
approximate description of friction given by the above two equations.

##### Table 1: Coefficients of friction

{: #Table1}

The equations given earlier include the dependence of friction on materials and
the normal force. The direction of friction is always opposite that of motion,
parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force.
For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor)
has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight, $$
W=mg\left(100 \kg \right)\left(
9.80\mss \right)=980 \N $$, perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of
static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor
greater than $$ f_{\s \left(\text{max}\right)}=\mu_
{\s} \mag{N}=\left(0.45\right)\left(980 \N \right)
=440\N $$ to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the
coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N (
$$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N}=\left(0.30\right)\left( 980\N \right)
=290\N $$ ) would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is
lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without
lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unit less quantity with a magnitude
usually between 0 and 1.0. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two
surfaces that are in contact.

Take-Home Experiment
</div>
Find a small plastic object (such as a food container) and slide it on a kitchen table by giving it a gentle tap. Now spray water on the table, simulating a light shower of rain. What happens now when you give the object the same-sized tap? Now add a few drops of (vegetable or olive) oil on the surface of the water and give the same tap. What happens now? This latter situation is particularly important for drivers to note, especially after a light rain shower. Why?

</div>

Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many
parts of the body, especially the joints, have much smaller coefficients of
friction—often three or four times less than ice. A joint is formed by the ends
of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by
the lower leg bone (the tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a
ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends
of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth,
almost glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that
reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an
artificial joint ([Figure 2](#Figure2)). These replacements can be made of metals (
stainless steel or titanium)
or plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

![Two X-x rays of an artificial knee replacement are shown.](../resources/Figure_05_01_02.jpg "Artificial knee replacement is a procedure that has been performed for more than 20 years. In this figure, we see the post-op x rays of the right knee joint replacement. (credit: Mike Baird, Flickr)")

Other natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in the
swallowing process, and the slippery mucus found between organs in the body,
allowing them to move freely past each other during heartbeats, during
breathing, and when a person moves. Artificial lubricants are also common in
hospitals and doctor’s clinics. For example, when ultrasonic imaging is carried
out, the gel that couples the transducer to the skin also serves to lubricate
the surface between the transducer and the skin—thereby reducing the coefficient
of friction between the two surfaces. This allows the transducer to move freely
over the skin.

Skiing Exercise
</div>
A skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N.

**Strategy**

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given in to be 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is
related to the normal force $$\mag{N}$$ as $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}
\mag{N} $$; thus, the coefficient of kinetic friction can be found if we can
find the normal force of the skier on a slope. The normal force is always
perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the
surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skier’s weight
perpendicular to the slope. (See the skier and free-body diagram
in [Figure 3](#Figure3).)

![The figure shows a skier going down a slope that forms an angle of 25 degrees with the horizontal. The weight of the skier, labeled w, is represented by a red arrow pointing vertically downward. This weight is divided into two components, w perpendicular is perpendicular to the slope, and w parallel is parallel to the slope. The normal force, labeled N, is also perpendicular to the slope, equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to w perpendicular. The friction, f, is represented by a red arrow pointing upslope. In addition, the figure shows a free body diagram that shows the relative magnitudes and directions of w, f, and N.](../resources/Figure_05_01_03.jpg "The motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope and so it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). \( \vb{N} \) (the normal force) is perpendicular to the slope, and \( \vb{f} \) (the friction) is parallel to the slope, but \( \vb{w} \) (the skier&#x2019;s weight) has components along both axes, namely \( w_\perp \) and \( w_\parallel \) . \( \vb{N} \) is equal in magnitude to \( w_\perp \), so there is no motion perpendicular to the slope. However, \( \mag{f} \) is less than \( \mag{W} \) in magnitude, so there is acceleration down the slope
(along the x-axis).")
{: #Figure3}

That is,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \mag{N}= w_{\perp }=w\cos{ 25^\circ }=mg \cos{ 25^\circ }. $$
</div>
Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we get

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{ 25^\circ }, $$
</div>
which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$.

**Solution**

Solving for $$ \mu_{\text{k} } $$ gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{\mag{N}}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{w\cos{
25^\circ }}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{mg \cos{ 25^\circ }.} $$
</div>
Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{45.0 \N }{\left(62 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(0.906\right)}=0.082. $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed
in [Table 1](#Table1) for waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since
values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like
this, where an object of mass $$ m $$ slides down a slope that makes an angle $$
\theta $$ with the horizontal, friction is given by $$ f_
{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta} $$. All objects will slide down a slope
with constant acceleration under these circumstances. Proof of this is left for
this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

Take-Home Experiment

An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object
is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects.
As shown in [Example 1](#example1), the kinetic friction force on a slope
$$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta} $$.
The component of the weight down the slope is equal to $$ mg \sin{\theta} $$
(see the free-body diagram in [Figure 3](#Figure3)). These
forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the
acceleration is zero. Writing these out:

<div class="equation">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}=m g \sin{\theta} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta} =mg \sin{\theta} . $$
</div>
Solving for $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$, we find that

<div class="equation">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{mg \sin{\theta} }{mg \cos{\theta} }=\tan{\theta} . $$
</div>
Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$. Note that the coin will not start to slide at all until an angle greater than
$$ \theta $$
is attained, since the coefficient of static friction is larger than the
coefficient of kinetic friction. Discuss how this may affect the value for $$
\mu_{\text{k}} $$
and its uncertainty.

</div>

We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a
normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple
friction is always proportional to the normal force.

Making Connections: Submicroscopic Explanations of Friction
</div>
The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of friction—they also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted (unnecessarily) to heat.

</div>

[Figure 4](#Figure4) illustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is
explained by microscopic (small-scale)
research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but
not to the area in contact, a somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough
surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total
area since only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the
actual contact area increases, and it is found that the friction is proportional
to this area.

![This figure has two parts, each of which shows two rough surfaces in close proximity to each other. In the first part, the normal force is small, so that the area of contact between the two surfaces is much smaller than their total area. In the second part, the normal force is large, so that the area of contact between the two surfaces has increased. As a result, the friction between the two surfaces in the second part is also greater than the friction in the first part.](../resources/Figure_05_01_04.jpg "Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When there is a greater normal force as a result of a greater applied force, the area of actual contact increases as does friction.")
{: #Figure4}

But the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features
of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now being determined. In
other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially, atoms are
linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms
adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrate—essentially creating sound waves
that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with distance and their
energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional
wear can also occur between atoms and molecules on the
surfaces. [Figure 5](#Figure5) shows how the tip of a probe drawn across another
material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip
can be measured and is found to be related to shear stress, which will be
discussed later in this chapter. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (
more than a factor of $$ 10^{12} $$ )
and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a
fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient
times—friction.

![This figure shows a molecular model of a probe that is dragged over the surface of a substrate. The substrate is represented by a rectangular prism, made up of a grid of small spheres, each sphere representing an atom. The probe, made up of a different grid of small spheres, is in the form of an inverted pyramid with a flattened peak. The pyramid is somewhat distorted because of friction.](../resources/Figure_05_01_05.jpg "The tip of a probe is deformed sideways by frictional force as the probe is dragged across a surface. Measurements of how the force varies for different materials are yielding fundamental insights into the atomic nature of friction.")

### Section Summary

* Friction is a contact force between systems that opposes the motion or
  attempted motion between them. Simple friction is proportional to the
  magnitude of the normal force $$ \mag{N} $$ pushing the systems together. (A
  normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface between systems.)
  Friction depends on both of the materials involved. The magnitude of static
  friction $$ f_{\s} $$ between systems stationary relative to one another is
  given by
  <div class="equation">
  $$ f_{\s}\le \mu_{\s} \mag{N}, $$
  </div>

where $$ \mu_{\s} $$ is the coefficient of static friction, which depends on
both of the materials.

* The kinetic friction force $$ f_{\text{k}} $$ between systems moving relative
  to one another is given by
  <div class="equation">
   $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N}, $$
  </div>

where $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also
depends on both materials.

A physics major is cooking breakfast when he notices that the frictional force between his steel
spatula and his Teflon frying pan is only 0.200 N. Knowing the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two materials, he quickly calculates the normal force. What is it?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship between kinetic friction force and normal force. From Table 1, the coefficient of kinetic friction between Teflon and steel is $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.04 $$. Since the spatula is moving across the pan, kinetic friction applies.

**Solution**

1. Write the equation for kinetic friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} $$
</div>

2. Solve for the normal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = \frac{f_{\text{k}}}{\mu_{\text{k}}} $$
</div>

3. Substitute the known values:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = \frac{0.200 \N}{0.04} = 5.00 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The normal force on the spatula is $$ 5.00 \N $$. This relatively small normal force makes sense for a lightweight spatula resting on a pan. The very low coefficient of friction for Teflon (0.04) means even small normal forces can produce measurable friction forces, which is why Teflon is such an effective non-stick coating.

(a) When rebuilding her car's engine, a physics major must exert 300 N of force to insert a dry steel piston into a steel cylinder. What is the magnitude of the normal force between the piston and cylinder?
(b) What is the magnitude of the force would she have to exert if the steel parts were oiled?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The force required to insert the piston must overcome the kinetic friction between the steel surfaces. From Table 1, we find $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.3 $$ for dry steel on steel, and $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.03 $$ for oiled steel on steel. We first find the normal force from part (a), then use it to find the required force when oiled.

**Solution**

(a) For the dry steel piston:

1. The applied force equals the kinetic friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{applied}} = f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} $$
</div>

2. Solve for the normal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = \frac{F_{\text{applied}}}{\mu_{\text{k}}} = \frac{300 \N}{0.3} = 1000 \N $$
</div>

(b) For the oiled steel piston:

1. The normal force remains the same (determined by how tightly the piston fits in the cylinder).

2. Calculate the new friction force with oiled surfaces:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{oiled}} = \mu_{\text{k,oiled}} \mag{N} = (0.03)(1000 \N) = 30 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The magnitude of the normal force between the piston and cylinder is $$ 1000 \N $$ or $$ 1.00 \times 10^3 \N $$. When the steel parts are oiled, the force required to insert the piston is only $$ 30 \N $$, which is just 10% of the force needed for dry steel. This demonstrates why lubrication is essential in engines—it dramatically reduces friction and wear between moving metal parts.

(a) What is the maximum frictional force in the knee joint of a person who supports 66.0 kg of her mass on that knee?
(b) During strenuous exercise it is possible to exert forces to the joints that are easily ten times greater than the weight being supported. What is the maximum force of friction under such conditions? The frictional forces in joints are relatively small in all circumstances except when the joints deteriorate, such as from injury or arthritis. Increased frictional forces can cause further damage and pain.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The knee joint is lubricated by synovial fluid. From Table 1, the coefficient of friction for bone lubricated by synovial fluid is $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.016 $$. The normal force in the joint equals the weight supported, and the maximum friction force is found using $$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N} $$.

**Solution**

(a) Normal standing on one knee:

1. Calculate the normal force (weight supported):
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg = (66.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 646.8 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N} = (0.016)(646.8 \N) = 10.3 \N $$
</div>

(b) During strenuous exercise:

1. The force on the joint is ten times the supported weight:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N}_{\text{exercise}} = 10 \times 646.8 \N = 6468 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N}_{\text{exercise}} = (0.016)(6468 \N) = 103 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The maximum frictional force in the knee joint is $$ 10.3 \N $$ during normal standing and $$ 103 \N $$ during strenuous exercise. These values are remarkably small considering the large forces involved, demonstrating how effectively synovial fluid lubricates our joints. The low coefficient of friction (0.016) is about 6 times lower than ice on ice, which explains why healthy joints move so smoothly. When joints deteriorate from arthritis or injury, this coefficient increases significantly, leading to pain and restricted movement.

**Strategy**

For part (a), we need to find the maximum static friction force, which equals the maximum force that can be applied without moving the crate. From Table 1, $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.5 $$ for wood on wood. For part (b), once the crate moves, kinetic friction applies with $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.3 $$. We use Newton's second law to find the acceleration.

**Solution**

(a) Maximum force without moving the crate:

1. Calculate the normal force (equal to the weight on a horizontal surface):
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg = (120 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 1176 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum static friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N} = (0.5)(1176 \N) = 588 \N $$
</div>

(b) Acceleration once the crate starts moving:

1. Calculate the kinetic friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} = (0.3)(1176 \N) = 352.8 \N $$
</div>

2. Apply Newton's second law. The net force is the applied force minus friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{applied}} - f_{\text{k}} = 588 \N - 352.8 \N = 235.2 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{235.2 \N}{120 \kg} = 1.96 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The maximum force you can exert horizontally without moving the crate is $$ 588 \N $$. Once the crate starts to slip with this same applied force, its acceleration is $$ 1.96 \mss $$. This problem illustrates why it's harder to start an object moving than to keep it moving—static friction (requiring 588 N to overcome) is greater than kinetic friction (only 352.8 N), so once the crate starts sliding, there's a net force that accelerates it.

(a) If half of the weight of a small $$ 1.00\times 10^{3}\kg $$ utility truck is supported by its two drive wheels, what is the magnitude of the
maximum acceleration it can achieve on dry concrete?
(b) Will a metal cabinet lying on the wooden bed of the truck slip if it accelerates at this rate?
(c) Solve both problems assuming the truck has four-wheel drive.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The maximum acceleration is limited by the maximum static friction force between the drive wheels and the road. From Table 1, $$ \mu_{\s} = 1.0 $$ for rubber on dry concrete. For part (b), we compare the friction available for the cabinet (metal on wood, $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.5 $$) with the friction force needed to accelerate it.

**Solution**

(a) Two-wheel drive maximum acceleration:

1. Calculate the weight supported by drive wheels:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = \frac{1}{2}mg = \frac{1}{2}(1.00 \times 10^{3} \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 4900 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum friction force from drive wheels:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = (1.0)(4900 \N) = 4900 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the maximum acceleration using Newton's second law:
<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{f_{\s(\text{max})}}{m} = \frac{4900 \N}{1.00 \times 10^{3} \kg} = 4.90 \mss $$
</div>

(b) Will the metal cabinet slip?

1. For the cabinet to not slip, the static friction must provide enough force to accelerate it:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{needed}} = m_{\text{cab}} a = m_{\text{cab}}(4.90 \mss) $$
</div>

2. The maximum friction available for metal on wood is:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{available}} = \mu_{\s} m_{\text{cab}} g = (0.5) m_{\text{cab}}(9.80 \mss) = m_{\text{cab}}(4.90 \mss) $$
</div>

3. Since $$ f_{\text{available}} = f_{\text{needed}} $$, the cabinet is right at the verge of slipping. Any slight increase in acceleration would cause it to slip.

(c) Four-wheel drive:

1. With four-wheel drive, all wheels are drive wheels:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = mg = (1.00 \times 10^{3} \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 9800 \N $$
</div>

2. Maximum friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = (1.0)(9800 \N) = 9800 \N $$
</div>

3. Maximum acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{9800 \N}{1.00 \times 10^{3} \kg} = 9.80 \mss $$
</div>

4. The cabinet will definitely slip since the maximum friction force it can experience ($$ \mu_{\s} m_{\text{cab}} g = 4.90 m_{\text{cab}} $$) is less than the force needed to accelerate it at $$ 9.80 \mss $$ ($$ F = 9.80 m_{\text{cab}} $$).

**Discussion**

For two-wheel drive, the maximum acceleration is $$ 4.90 \mss $$, and the cabinet is on the verge of slipping. For four-wheel drive, the maximum acceleration doubles to $$ 9.80 \mss $$ (equal to g), and the cabinet will definitely slip. This explains why cargo must be properly secured in trucks, especially those with high-traction four-wheel drive systems.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A team of eight dogs pulls a sled with waxed wood runners on wet snow (mush!). The dogs have average masses of 19.0 kg, and the loaded sled with its rider has a mass of 210 kg.
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of 185 N backward on the snow.
(b) What is the magnitude of the acceleration once the sled starts to move?
(c) For both situations, calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

By Newton's third law, when the dogs push backward on the snow with 185 N each, the snow pushes forward on each dog with 185 N. From Table 1, for waxed wood on wet snow: $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.14 $$ and $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$. We'll apply Newton's second law to the entire system (dogs + sled) to find acceleration, and then to just the sled to find the coupling force.

**Solution**

First, identify the masses:
- Total mass of dogs: $$ m_{\text{dogs}} = 8 \times 19.0 \kg = 152 \kg $$
- Mass of sled with rider: $$ m_{\text{sled}} = 210 \kg $$
- Total system mass: $$ m_{\text{total}} = 152 \kg + 210 \kg = 362 \kg $$

(a) Starting from rest (static friction):

1. Calculate the total forward force from all dogs:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{dogs}} = 8 \times 185 \N = 1480 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum static friction force on the sled:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s} = \mu_{\s} m_{\text{sled}} g = (0.14)(210 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 288.1 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the net force on the system:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{dogs}} - f_{\s} = 1480 \N - 288.1 \N = 1191.9 \N $$
</div>

4. Calculate the acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1191.9 \N}{362 \kg} = 3.29 \mss $$
</div>

(b) Once the sled is moving (kinetic friction):

1. Calculate the kinetic friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}} m_{\text{sled}} g = (0.1)(210 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 205.8 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the net force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = 1480 \N - 205.8 \N = 1274.2 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{1274.2 \N}{362 \kg} = 3.52 \mss $$
</div>

(c) Force in the coupling:

For the sled alone, the coupling force $$ T $$ must provide enough force to accelerate it against friction.

Starting from rest:
<div class="equation">
$$ T - f_{\s} = m_{\text{sled}} a $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T = m_{\text{sled}} a + f_{\s} = (210 \kg)(3.29 \mss) + 288.1 \N = 691 \N + 288 \N = 980 \N $$
</div>

Once moving:
<div class="equation">
$$ T = m_{\text{sled}} a + f_{\text{k}} = (210 \kg)(3.52 \mss) + 205.8 \N = 739 \N + 206 \N = 945 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The acceleration starting from rest is $$ 3.29 \mss $$, and once moving it increases to $$ 3.52 \mss $$ because kinetic friction is less than static friction. The coupling force is $$ 980 \N $$ at the start and $$ 945 \N $$ once moving. The coupling force is less than the total force exerted by the dogs (1480 N) because the dogs must also accelerate their own mass.

{: #Figure7}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use vector addition to find the total force from the two perpendicular forces. From Table 1, for steel on ice: $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.04 $$ and $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.02 $$. For part (b), since she starts at rest, static friction opposes the attempted motion. For part (c), kinetic friction applies since she's already moving.

**Solution**

(a) Find the magnitude and direction of $$ \vb{F}_{\text{tot}} $$:

1. Since $$ F_1 $$ and $$ F_2 $$ are perpendicular, use the Pythagorean theorem:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2} = \sqrt{(26.4 \N)^2 + (18.6 \N)^2} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{697.0 + 346.0} = \sqrt{1043} = 32.3 \N $$
</div>

2. Find the direction (angle above the horizontal, measured from $$ F_1 $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F_2}{F_1}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{18.6}{26.4}\right) = \tan^{-1}(0.704) = 35.1° $$
</div>

(b) Initial acceleration (starting from rest):

1. Calculate the normal force (equal to weight on horizontal ice):
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg = (65.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 637 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the maximum static friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s} \mag{N} = (0.04)(637 \N) = 25.5 \N $$
</div>

3. Since $$ F_{\text{tot}} = 32.3 \N > f_{\s(\text{max})} = 25.5 \N $$, the skater will begin to move.

4. Once motion begins, kinetic friction applies:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}} \mag{N} = (0.02)(637 \N) = 12.7 \N $$
</div>

5. Calculate the net force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{tot}} - f_{\text{k}} = 32.3 \N - 12.7 \N = 19.6 \N $$
</div>

6. Calculate the initial acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{19.6 \N}{65.0 \kg} = 0.302 \mss $$
</div>

(c) Acceleration while already moving:

The calculation is identical to part (b) once motion has begun, since kinetic friction applies in both cases:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = 0.302 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The total force on the skater is $$ 32.3 \N $$ at an angle of $$ 35.1° $$ above the horizontal (from $$ F_1 $$). Her acceleration is $$ 0.302 \mss $$ in both cases (b) and (c) because once she begins moving, kinetic friction determines the friction force regardless of whether she just started or was already moving. The very low coefficient of friction on ice (0.02 kinetic) allows even modest forces to produce noticeable acceleration.

Show that the acceleration of any object down a frictionless incline that makes an angle $$ \theta $$ with the horizontal is $$
a=g\sin{\theta} $$. (Note that this acceleration is independent of mass.)

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We analyze the forces on an object on a frictionless incline using a coordinate system with one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular. The only forces are gravity and the normal force. We decompose the gravitational force into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline, then apply Newton's second law along the incline.

**Solution**

1. Identify the forces on the object:
   - Weight: $$ w = mg $$ (directed straight down)
   - Normal force: $$ \mag{N} $$ (perpendicular to the incline surface)

2. Decompose the weight into components relative to the incline:
   - Perpendicular to incline: $$ w_\perp = mg\cos\theta $$
   - Parallel to incline (down the slope): $$ w_\parallel = mg\sin\theta $$

3. Apply Newton's second law perpendicular to the incline:
<div class="equation">
$$ \sum F_\perp = \mag{N} - mg\cos\theta = 0 $$
</div>
This confirms the object doesn't accelerate perpendicular to the surface.

4. Apply Newton's second law parallel to the incline (taking down the slope as positive):
<div class="equation">
$$ \sum F_\parallel = mg\sin\theta = ma $$

5. Solve for acceleration:

$$ ma = mg\sin\theta $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ a = g\sin\theta $$

**Discussion**

The acceleration of any object on a frictionless incline is $$ a = g\sin\theta $$, which depends only on the angle of the incline and the acceleration due to gravity. The mass $$ m $$ cancels out, confirming that all objects slide down a frictionless incline with the same acceleration, regardless of their mass. This is consistent with Galileo's observation that objects fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance. Note that when $$ \theta = 0° $$, $$ a = 0 $$ (horizontal surface), and when $$ \theta = 90° $$, $$ a = g $$ (free fall).

<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We follow the same approach as the previous problem, but now include kinetic friction opposing the motion down the incline. The friction force acts up the slope (opposite to the direction of motion) and depends on the normal force.

**Solution**

1. Identify the forces on the object:
   - Weight: $$ w = mg $$ (directed straight down)
   - Normal force: $$ \mag{N} $$ (perpendicular to the incline surface)
   - Kinetic friction: $$ f_{\text{k}} $$ (parallel to incline, opposing motion, so directed up the slope)

2. Decompose the weight into components:
   - Perpendicular to incline: $$ w_\perp = mg\cos\theta $$
   - Parallel to incline (down the slope): $$ w_\parallel = mg\sin\theta $$

4. Express the kinetic friction force:

5. Apply Newton's second law parallel to the incline (taking down the slope as positive):

$$ \sum F_\parallel = mg\sin\theta - f_{\text{k}} = ma $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ mg\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}} mg\cos\theta = ma $$

6. Solve for acceleration by factoring out $$ mg $$:

$$ mg(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) = ma $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ a = g(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) $$

**Discussion**

The acceleration down an incline with friction is $$ a = g(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) $$. This result is independent of mass because both the gravitational force component and the friction force are proportional to mass. When $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0 $$ (no friction), the equation reduces to $$ a = g\sin\theta $$, matching the frictionless case from the previous problem. If friction is large enough that $$ \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta > \sin\theta $$, the acceleration would be negative, meaning the object would decelerate (as when going up a slope) or wouldn't slide at all without an initial push.

**Strategy**

When going uphill, both gravity and friction act to slow the snowboarder down. The component of gravity parallel to the slope points downhill (opposing uphill motion), and kinetic friction also opposes the uphill motion (so it also points downhill). From Table 1, for waxed wood on wet snow: $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$.

**Solution**

1. Draw a free-body diagram with forces:
   - Weight component parallel to slope: $$ w_\parallel = mg\sin\theta $$ (down the slope)
   - Weight component perpendicular to slope: $$ w_\perp = mg\cos\theta $$

**Discussion**

The snowboarder decelerates at $$ 1.83 \mss $$ while going uphill. Note that when going uphill, friction adds to the deceleration (both gravity component and friction point downhill), whereas when going downhill, friction subtracts from the acceleration.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we use the result derived earlier: $$ a = g(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) $$ for an object sliding down an incline. From Table 1, for waxed wood on wet snow: $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$. For part (b), constant velocity means zero acceleration, so we set $$ a = 0 $$ and solve for the angle.

**Solution**

(a) Acceleration down the $$ 10.0° $$ slope:

1. Use the formula for acceleration on an incline with friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = g(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) $$
</div>

2. Substitute values ($$ \theta = 10.0° $$, $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$, $$ g = 9.80 \mss $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(\sin 10.0° - 0.1 \cos 10.0°) $$

<div class="equation">
$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.1736 - 0.1 \times 0.9848) $$

$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.1736 - 0.0985) $$

$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.0751) = 0.736 \mss $$

(b) Angle for constant velocity (zero acceleration):

1. Set $$ a = 0 $$ in the acceleration formula:
<div class="equation">
$$ 0 = g(\sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta) $$
</div>

2. Since $$ g \neq 0 $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \sin\theta - \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta = 0 $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \sin\theta = \mu_{\text{k}}\cos\theta $$
</div>

3. Divide both sides by $$ \cos\theta $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \tan\theta = \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$
</div>

4. Solve for the angle:
<div class="equation">
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}(0.1) = 5.71° $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The skier accelerates at $$ 0.736 \mss $$ on the $$ 10.0° $$ slope. To coast at constant velocity, the skier would need a slope of $$ 5.71° $$. At this angle, the component of gravity pulling the skier downhill exactly equals the friction force opposing the motion. On steeper slopes, the skier accelerates; on gentler slopes, the skier decelerates. This relationship $$ \tan\theta = \mu_{\text{k}} $$ provides a simple way to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction by finding the angle at which an object slides at constant velocity.

If an object is to rest on an incline without slipping, then friction must equal the component of the weight of the object parallel to the incline. This requires greater and greater friction for steeper slopes. Show that the maximum angle of an incline above the horizontal for which an object will not slide down is $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}{\text{μ}}_{\s} $$. You may use the result of the previous problem. Assume that $$ a=0 $$
and that static friction force has reached its maximum value.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For an object at rest on an incline at the verge of slipping, static friction has reached its maximum value and the object has zero acceleration. We apply Newton's second law with $$ a = 0 $$ and $$ f_{\s} = \mu_{\s}\mag{N} $$ (maximum static friction) to find the critical angle.

**Solution**

1. Identify forces on the object at rest on the incline:
   - Weight component parallel to slope (down): $$ w_\parallel = mg\sin\theta $$
   - Weight component perpendicular to slope: $$ w_\perp = mg\cos\theta $$
   - Normal force: $$ \mag{N} = mg\cos\theta $$

<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s}\mag{N} = \mu_{\s}mg\cos\theta $$
</div>

4. Set the required friction equal to the maximum available friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ mg\sin\theta = \mu_{\s}mg\cos\theta $$
</div>

5. Cancel $$ mg $$ from both sides and solve:
<div class="equation">
$$ \sin\theta = \mu_{\s}\cos\theta $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} = \mu_{\s} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \tan\theta = \mu_{\s} $$
</div>

6. Solve for the maximum angle:
<div class="equation">
$$ \theta_{\text{max}} = \tan^{-1}(\mu_{\s}) $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The maximum angle at which an object can rest on an incline without sliding is $$ \theta = \tan^{-1}(\mu_{\s}) $$. This result is independent of the object's mass. For angles less than this, static friction is sufficient to prevent sliding. For angles greater than this, the object will begin to slide. This relationship provides a practical method for measuring the coefficient of static friction: tilt a surface until an object just begins to slide, then $$ \mu_{\s} = \tan\theta_{\text{critical}} $$.

Calculate the maximum deceleration of a car that is heading down a $$ 6^\circ $$
slope (one that makes an angle of $$ 6^\circ $$
with the horizontal) under the following road conditions. You may assume that
the weight of the car is evenly distributed on all four tires and that the
coefficient of static friction is involved—that is, the tires are not allowed to
slip during the deceleration. (Ignore rolling.) Calculate for a car:
(a) On dry concrete.
(b) On wet concrete.
(c) On ice, assuming that $$ \mu_{\s}=0.100 $$, the same as for shoes on ice.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When braking while heading downhill, gravity pulls the car down the slope while friction (from braking) acts up the slope. The maximum deceleration occurs when static friction reaches its maximum value (tires at the verge of slipping). All four tires contribute to braking, so the full weight contributes to the normal force. From Table 1: rubber on dry concrete $$ \mu_{\s} = 1.0 $$, rubber on wet concrete $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.7 $$.

**Solution**

For a car on a slope, the forces parallel to the slope are:
- Gravity component (down slope): $$ mg\sin\theta $$
- Maximum friction (up slope when braking): $$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s}mg\cos\theta $$

The maximum deceleration occurs when braking force is maximum:
<div class="equation">
$$ ma = f_{\s(\text{max})} - mg\sin\theta = \mu_{\s}mg\cos\theta - mg\sin\theta $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ a = g(\mu_{\s}\cos\theta - \sin\theta) $$
</div>

With $$ \theta = 6° $$: $$ \sin 6° = 0.1045 $$, $$ \cos 6° = 0.9945 $$

(a) On dry concrete ($$ \mu_{\s} = 1.0 $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(1.0 \times 0.9945 - 0.1045) $$
</div>

$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.9945 - 0.1045) = (9.80 \mss)(0.890) = 8.72 \mss $$

</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.6962 - 0.1045) = (9.80 \mss)(0.592) = 5.80 \mss $$

(c) On ice ($$ \mu_{\s} = 0.100 $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.100 \times 0.9945 - 0.1045) $$

$$ a = (9.80 \mss)(0.0995 - 0.1045) = (9.80 \mss)(-0.005) = -0.049 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The maximum deceleration is $$ 8.72 \mss $$ on dry concrete, $$ 5.80 \mss $$ on wet concrete, and $$ -0.049 \mss $$ on ice. The negative value for ice is significant: it means the car cannot decelerate at all on this slope! Instead, even with maximum braking, the car will accelerate down the hill at about $$ 0.05 \mss $$. The friction force is insufficient to overcome the gravitational component pulling the car downhill. This illustrates why icy hills are so dangerous—braking can be nearly impossible.

Calculate the maximum acceleration of a car that is heading up a $$ 4^\circ $$
slope (one that makes an angle of $$ 4^\circ $$

(b) On wet concrete.
(c) On ice, assuming that $$\mu_{\s}=0.100 $$, the same as for shoes on ice.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When accelerating uphill, the drive wheels push backward on the road, and friction pushes the car forward (up the slope). However, gravity acts down the slope. Since only half the weight is on the drive wheels, only half the weight contributes to the friction force. The maximum acceleration occurs when friction reaches its maximum value.

**Solution**

The normal force on the drive wheels is half the perpendicular weight component:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = \frac{1}{2}mg\cos\theta $$
</div>

The maximum friction force (providing forward acceleration):

$$ f_{\s(\text{max})} = \mu_{\s}\mag{N}_{\text{drive}} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_{\s}mg\cos\theta $$

(a) On dry concrete ($$ \mu_{\s} = 1.0 $$):

**Discussion**

The maximum acceleration is $$ 4.20 \mss $$ on dry concrete, $$ 2.74 \mss $$ on wet concrete, and $$ -0.195 \mss $$ on ice. The negative value for ice means the car cannot accelerate up the hill at all—even at full throttle without wheel spin, the car will slide backward down the slope. This demonstrates why two-wheel drive vehicles struggle on icy inclines. Note that these values are roughly half what they would be with four-wheel drive because only half the weight provides traction.

With four-wheel drive, all four wheels are drive wheels, so the full weight of the car (times $$ \cos\theta $$) contributes to the normal force for friction. This doubles the available friction force compared to two-wheel drive.

**Discussion**

With four-wheel drive, the maximum acceleration is $$ 9.09 \mss $$ on dry concrete, $$ 6.16 \mss $$ on wet concrete, and $$ 0.294 \mss $$ on ice. These values are approximately double those for two-wheel drive. Notably, with four-wheel drive on ice, the car can now accelerate (albeit slowly at $$ 0.29 \mss $$), whereas it would slide backward with two-wheel drive. This demonstrates the significant advantage of four-wheel drive on slippery surfaces and inclines.

A freight train consists of two $$ 8.00 \times 10^{5}\text{-kg} $$
engines and 45 cars with average masses of $$5.50 \times 10^{5}\kg $$.
(a) What force must each engine exert backward on the track to accelerate the
train at a rate of $$5.00 \times 10^{-2} \mss  $$
if the force of friction is $$7.50 \times 10^{5}\N $$, assuming the engines
exert identical forces? This is not a large frictional
force for such a massive system. Rolling friction for trains is small, and
consequently trains are very energy-efficient transportation systems.
(b) What is the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the 37th and 38th cars (
this is the force each exerts on the other), assuming all cars have the same
mass and that friction is evenly distributed among all of the cars and engines?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For part (a), we apply Newton's second law to the entire train to find the total propulsive force needed, then divide by 2 for each engine. For part (b), we consider the cars behind the 37th-38th coupling (cars 38-45) as a separate system. The coupling force must accelerate these 8 cars and overcome their share of friction.

**Solution**

First, calculate the total mass of the train:
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{total}} = 2(8.00 \times 10^5 \kg) + 45(5.50 \times 10^5 \kg) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{total}} = 1.60 \times 10^6 \kg + 2.475 \times 10^7 \kg = 2.635 \times 10^7 \kg $$
</div>

(a) Force from each engine:

1. Apply Newton's second law to find the total required force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} - f = m_{\text{total}} \cdot a $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{total}} \cdot a + f $$
</div>

2. Substitute values:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = (2.635 \times 10^7 \kg)(5.00 \times 10^{-2} \mss) + 7.50 \times 10^5 \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{total}} = 1.3175 \times 10^6 \N + 7.50 \times 10^5 \N = 2.0675 \times 10^6 \N $$
</div>

3. Each engine exerts half of this force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{engine}} = \frac{2.0675 \times 10^6 \N}{2} = 1.03 \times 10^6 \N $$
</div>

(b) Force in coupling between cars 37 and 38:

1. This coupling pulls cars 38 through 45 (8 cars):
<div class="equation">
$$ m_{\text{8 cars}} = 8 \times 5.50 \times 10^5 \kg = 4.40 \times 10^6 \kg $$
</div>

2. Calculate friction on these 8 cars. Total train has 47 units (2 engines + 45 cars), so friction per unit:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{per unit}} = \frac{7.50 \times 10^5 \N}{47} = 1.596 \times 10^4 \N $$
</div>

3. Friction on 8 cars:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{8 cars}} = 8 \times 1.596 \times 10^4 \N = 1.277 \times 10^5 \N $$
</div>

4. Apply Newton's second law to the 8 cars:
<div class="equation">
$$ T - f_{\text{8 cars}} = m_{\text{8 cars}} \cdot a $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T = m_{\text{8 cars}} \cdot a + f_{\text{8 cars}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T = (4.40 \times 10^6 \kg)(5.00 \times 10^{-2} \mss) + 1.277 \times 10^5 \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T = 2.20 \times 10^5 \N + 1.277 \times 10^5 \N = 3.48 \times 10^5 \N $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Each engine must exert a force of $$ 1.03 \times 10^6 \N $$ backward on the track. The force in the coupling between cars 37 and 38 is $$ 3.48 \times 10^5 \N $$. This coupling force is less than the engine force because it only needs to accelerate the 8 cars behind it (plus overcome their friction), not the entire train. Couplings closer to the engines experience larger forces because they must accelerate more cars.

exert with her feet on the vertical rock face to remain stationary. Assume that
the force is exerted parallel to her legs. Also, assume negligible force exerted

(b) What is the minimum coefficient of friction between her shoes
and the cliff?

![A mountain climber with a mass of fifty two kilograms exerts force with her feet parallel to her legs on a vertical rock face to remain stationary. The angle between her legs and the rock face is fifteen degrees, whereas the angle between the rope and the cliff is thirty one degrees.](../resources/Figure_05_01_08.jpg "Part of the climber&#x2019;s weight is supported by her rope and part by friction between her feet and the rock face.")
{: #Figure8}

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The climber is in equilibrium, so the sum of forces in both horizontal and vertical directions must be zero. The rope makes an angle of 31° with the vertical cliff. The leg force is directed 15° from the vertical cliff (into the cliff). We decompose all forces into horizontal and vertical components and solve the system of equations.

**Solution**

Define the forces:
- Weight: $$ w = mg = (52.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) = 509.6 \N $$ (downward)
- Tension: $$ T $$ at 31° from vertical (away from cliff)
- Leg force: $$ F_{\text{leg}} $$ at 15° from vertical (into cliff)
- Normal force from cliff: $$ \mag{N} $$ (horizontal, away from cliff)
- Friction: $$ f $$ (vertical, upward along cliff)

(a) Force equilibrium equations:

Horizontal (positive = away from cliff):
<div class="equation">
$$ T\sin 31° - F_{\text{leg}}\sin 15° = 0 $$
</div>

Vertical (positive = upward):
<div class="equation">
$$ T\cos 31° + f - w = 0 $$
</div>

For the leg force, the component into the cliff provides the normal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = F_{\text{leg}}\sin 15° $$
</div>

And the component along the cliff provides friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ f = F_{\text{leg}}\cos 15° $$
</div>

From the horizontal equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ T\sin 31° = F_{\text{leg}}\sin 15° $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ T = F_{\text{leg}}\frac{\sin 15°}{\sin 31°} = F_{\text{leg}}\frac{0.2588}{0.5150} = 0.5025 F_{\text{leg}} $$
</div>

Substituting into the vertical equation:
<div class="equation">
$$ (0.5025 F_{\text{leg}})\cos 31° + F_{\text{leg}}\cos 15° = w $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{leg}}(0.5025 \times 0.8572 + 0.9659) = 509.6 \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{leg}}(0.4307 + 0.9659) = 509.6 \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{leg}} = \frac{509.6 \N}{1.397} = 365 \N $$
</div>

Now find the tension:
<div class="equation">
$$ T = 0.5025 \times 365 \N = 183 \N $$
</div>

(b) Minimum coefficient of friction:

Calculate the normal force and friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = F_{\text{leg}}\sin 15° = (365 \N)(0.2588) = 94.5 \N $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ f = F_{\text{leg}}\cos 15° = (365 \N)(0.9659) = 353 \N $$
</div>

The minimum coefficient of friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mu_{\s(\text{min})} = \frac{f}{\mag{N}} = \frac{353 \N}{94.5 \N} = 3.73 $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The tension in the rope is $$ 183 \N $$ and the leg force is $$ 365 \N $$. The minimum coefficient of friction required is $$ 3.73 $$. This very high coefficient (much greater than typical rubber on rock values around 0.6-0.8) indicates that this climbing position requires specialized climbing shoes with very high friction, or more realistically, that the climber must also use arm strength or adjust her position. The geometry of the problem (shallow leg angle) creates a situation where most of the leg force goes into friction rather than normal force, demanding an unusually high friction coefficient.

A contestant in a winter sporting event pushes a 45.0-kg block of ice across a frozen lake as shown in [Figure 9](#Figure9)(a).
(a) Calculate the minimum force $$ F $$ he must exert to get the block moving.
(b) What is the magnitude of its acceleration once it starts to move, if that force is maintained?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When pushing at an angle below horizontal (25° as shown in Figure 9a), the force has a horizontal component that moves the block and a vertical component that increases the normal force (and thus friction). From Table 1, for ice on ice: $$ \mu_{\s} = 0.1 $$ and $$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.03 $$.

**Solution**

(a) Minimum force to start the block moving:

1. Decompose the applied force $$ F $$ at angle 25° below horizontal:
   - Horizontal component: $$ F_x = F\cos 25° $$
   - Vertical component (downward): $$ F_y = F\sin 25° $$

2. Apply Newton's second law in the vertical direction (at rest, $$ a_y = 0 $$):
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} - mg - F\sin 25° = 0 $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg + F\sin 25° $$
</div>

3. To just start moving, the horizontal force must equal maximum static friction:
<div class="equation">
$$ F\cos 25° = \mu_{\s}\mag{N} = \mu_{\s}(mg + F\sin 25°) $$
</div>

4. Solve for $$ F $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ F\cos 25° = \mu_{\s} mg + \mu_{\s} F\sin 25° $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F(\cos 25° - \mu_{\s}\sin 25°) = \mu_{\s} mg $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{\mu_{\s} mg}{\cos 25° - \mu_{\s}\sin 25°} $$
</div>

5. Substitute values:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{(0.1)(45.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{0.9063 - (0.1)(0.4226)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{44.1 \N}{0.9063 - 0.0423} = \frac{44.1 \N}{0.864} = 51.0 \N $$
</div>

(b) Acceleration once moving:

1. Calculate the normal force with $$ F = 51.0 \N $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg + F\sin 25° = (45.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) + (51.0 \N)(0.4226) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = 441 \N + 21.6 \N = 462.6 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the kinetic friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}\mag{N} = (0.03)(462.6 \N) = 13.9 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the net horizontal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F\cos 25° - f_{\text{k}} = (51.0 \N)(0.9063) - 13.9 \N = 46.2 \N - 13.9 \N = 32.3 \N $$
</div>

4. Calculate the acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{32.3 \N}{45.0 \kg} = 0.718 \mss \approx 0.720 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The minimum force required to start the block moving is $$ 51.0 \N $$. Once moving, maintaining this force produces an acceleration of $$ 0.720 \mss $$. The acceleration is possible because kinetic friction ($$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.03 $$) is less than static friction ($$ \mu_{\text{k}} = 0.1 $$), so the net force increases once motion begins. Note that pushing at an angle increases the normal force (and hence friction), which is why the required force is higher than if pushing horizontally.

When pulling at an angle above horizontal (25°), the vertical component of the force is upward, which reduces the normal force and thus reduces friction.

<div class="equation">
$$ F\cos 25° = \mu_{\s} mg - \mu_{\s} F\sin 25° $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F(\cos 25° + \mu_{\s}\sin 25°) = \mu_{\s} mg $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{\mu_{\s} mg}{\cos 25° + \mu_{\s}\sin 25°} $$
</div>

5. Substitute values:
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{(0.1)(45.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss)}{0.9063 + (0.1)(0.4226)} $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F = \frac{44.1 \N}{0.9063 + 0.0423} = \frac{44.1 \N}{0.949} = 46.5 \N $$
</div>

(b) Acceleration once moving:

1. Calculate the normal force with $$ F = 46.5 \N $$:
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = mg - F\sin 25° = (45.0 \kg)(9.80 \mss) - (46.5 \N)(0.4226) $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ \mag{N} = 441 \N - 19.7 \N = 421.3 \N $$
</div>

2. Calculate the kinetic friction force:
<div class="equation">
$$ f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}\mag{N} = (0.03)(421.3 \N) = 12.6 \N $$
</div>

3. Calculate the net horizontal force:
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F\cos 25° - f_{\text{k}} = (46.5 \N)(0.9063) - 12.6 \N = 42.1 \N - 12.6 \N = 29.5 \N $$
</div>

4. Calculate the acceleration:
<div class="equation">
$$ a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{29.5 \N}{45.0 \kg} = 0.656 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

When pulling, the minimum force required is $$ 46.5 \N $$, and the acceleration once moving is $$ 0.656 \mss $$. Comparing with pushing (51.0 N required, 0.720 m/s² acceleration): pulling requires less force to start the block moving because the upward component reduces the normal force and friction. However, the acceleration when pulling is slightly less because the horizontal component of the smaller pulling force (42.1 N) is less than the horizontal component of the larger pushing force (46.2 N). Overall, pulling is more efficient for starting motion, which is why it's generally easier to pull heavy objects at an angle than to push them.

friction
: a force that opposes relative motion or attempts at motion between systems in
contact

kinetic friction
: a force that opposes the motion of two systems that are in contact and moving
relative to one another

static friction
: a force that opposes the motion of two systems that are in contact and are not
moving relative to one another

magnitude of static friction
: $$ f_{\s}\le \mu_{\s}\mag{N} $$, where $$ \mu_{\s} $$ is the coefficient of
static friction and $$ \mag{N} $$ is the magnitude of the normal force

magnitude of kinetic friction
: $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k} }\mag{N} $$, where $$ \mu_{\text{k} } $$ is the
coefficient of kinetic friction
