There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How
long does a foot race take?” and “What was the runner’s speed?” cannot be
answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we add
definitions of time, velocity, and speed to expand our description of motion.

### Time

As discussed
in [Physical Quantities and Units](./ch1PhysicalQuantitiesAndUnits)
, the most fundamental physical quantities are defined by how they are measured.
This is the case with time. Every measurement of time involves measuring a
change in some physical quantity. It may be a number on a digital clock, a
heartbeat, or the position of the Sun in the sky. In physics, the definition of
time is simple—**time** is *change*, or the interval over which change occurs.
It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes.

The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a standard. The SI
unit for time is the second, abbreviated s. We might, for example, observe that
a certain pendulum makes one full swing every 0.75 s. We could then use the
pendulum to measure time by counting its swings or, of course, by connecting the
pendulum to a clock mechanism that registers time on a dial. This allows us to
not only measure the amount of time, but also to determine a sequence of events.

How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed time for a
particular motion, such as how long it takes an airplane passenger to get from
his seat to the back of the plane. To find elapsed time, we note the time at the
beginning and end of the motion and subtract the two. For example, a lecture may
start at 11:00 A.M. and end at 11:50 A.M., so that the elapsed time would be 50
min. **Elapsed time** $$ \Delta t $$ is the difference between the ending time
and beginning time,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta t=t_{f}-t_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ \Delta t $$ is the change in time or elapsed time, $$ t_{f} $$ is the
time at the end of the motion, and $$ t_{0} $$ is the time at the beginning of
the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol, $$ \Delta $$, means the change in the
quantity that follows it.)

Life is simpler if the beginning time $$ t_{0} $$ is taken to be zero, as when
we use a stopwatch. If we were using a stopwatch, it would simply read zero at
the start of the lecture and 50 min at the end. If $$ t_{0}=0 $$, then $$ \Delta
t=t_{f}\equiv t $$.

In this text, for simplicity’s sake,

* motion starts at time equal to zero $$ \left(t_
  {0}=0\right) $$
* the symbol $$ t $$ is used for elapsed time unless otherwise specified $$
  \left(\Delta t=t_{f}\equiv t\right) $$

### Velocity

Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific definition. You
know that if you have a large displacement in a small amount of time you have a
large velocity, and that velocity has units of distance divided by time, such as
miles per hour or kilometers per hour.

<div class="note" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Average Velocity
</div>

**Average velocity** is *displacement (change in position) divided by the time
of travel*,

<div class="equation">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ \Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{ x_{f}-x_{0}}{ t_{f}-t_{0}}, $$
</div>
where $$ \overline{v} $$ is the *average* (indicated by the bar over the $$
v $$) velocity, $$ \Delta x $$ is the change in position (or displacement), and $$
x_{f} $$ and $$ x_{0} $$ are the final and beginning positions at times $$ t_{f}
$$ and $$ t_{0} $$, respectively. If the starting time $$ t_{0} $$ is taken to
be zero, then the average velocity is simply

<div class="equation">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ \Delta x}{t}. $$
</div>
</div>

Notice that this definition indicates that *velocity is a vector because
displacement is a vector*. It has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit for
velocity is meters per second or m/s, but many other units, such as km/h, mi/h (
also written as mph), and cm/s, are in common use. Suppose, for example, an
airplane passenger took 5 seconds to move −4 m (the negative sign indicates that
displacement is toward the back of the plane). His average velocity would be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ \Delta x}{t}=\frac{-4\m }{5\s }=-0.8 \ms . $$
</div>

The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of the
plane.

The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what happens
to it between the starting point and ending point, however. For example, we
cannot tell from average velocity whether the airplane passenger stops
momentarily or backs up before he goes to the back of the plane. To get more
details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time
intervals.

![Airplane shown from the outside. Vector arrows show paths of each individual segment of the passenger&#x2019;s trip to the back of the plane.](../resources/Figure_02_03_02.jpg "A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip. ")
{: #Figure2}

The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed the
information. When we carry this process to its logical conclusion, we are left
with an infinitesimally small interval. Over such an interval, the average
velocity becomes the *instantaneous velocity* or the *velocity at a specific
instant*. A car’s speedometer, for example, shows the magnitude (but not the
direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give tickets based
on instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long it will take to get
from one place to another on a road trip, you need to use average velocity.)
**Instantaneous velocity** $$ v $$ is the average velocity at a specific instant
in time (or over an infinitesimally small time interval).

Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity, $$ v $$, at a precise instant $$
t $$ can involve taking a limit, a calculus operation beyond the scope of this
text. However, under many circumstances, we can find precise values for
instantaneous velocity without calculus.

### Speed

In everyday language, most people use the terms “speed” and “velocity”
interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and they
are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction.
Thus *speed is a scalar*. Just as we need to distinguish between instantaneous
velocity and average velocity, we also need to distinguish between instantaneous
speed and average speed.

**Instantaneous speed** is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example,
suppose the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of
−3.0 m/s (the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that same time his
instantaneous speed was 3.0 m/s. Or suppose that at one time during a shopping
trip your instantaneous velocity is 40 km/h due north. Your instantaneous speed
at that instant would be 40 km/h—the same magnitude but without a direction.
Average speed, however, is very different from average velocity. **Average
speed** is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.

We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than displacement. So
average speed can be greater than average velocity, which is displacement
divided by time. For example, if you drive to a store and return home in half an
hour, and your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then
your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was zero,
because your displacement for the round trip is zero. (Displacement is change in
position and, thus, is zero for a round trip.) Thus average speed is *not*
simply the magnitude of average velocity.

![A house and a store, with a set of arrows in between showing that the distance between them is 3 point 0 kilometers and the total distance traveled, delta x total, equals 0 kilometers.](../resources/Figure_02_03_03.jpg "During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement for the round trip is zero, since there was no net change in position. Thus the average velocity is zero. ")
{: #Figure3}

Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A plot of
position or of velocity as a function of time can be very useful. For example,
for this trip to the store, the position, velocity, and speed-vs.-time graphs
are displayed in [Figure 4](#Figure4). (Note that these graphs depict a very
simplified **model** of the trip. We are assuming that speed is constant during
the trip, which is unrealistic given that we’ll probably stop at the store. But
for simplicity’s sake, we will model it with no stops or changes in speed. We
are also assuming that the route between the store and the house is a perfectly
straight line.)

![Three line graphs. First line graph is of position in kilometers versus time in hours. The line increases linearly from 0 kilometers to 6 kilometers in the first 0 point 25 hours. It then decreases linearly from 6 kilometers to 0 kilometers between 0 point 25 and 0 point 5 hours. Second line graph shows velocity in kilometers per hour versus time in hours. The line is flat at 12 kilometers per hour from time 0 to time 0 point 25. It is vertical at time 0 point 25, dropping from 12 kilometers per hour to negative 12 kilometers per hour. It is flat again at negative 12 kilometers per hour from 0 point 25 hours to 0 point 5 hours. Third line graph shows speed in kilometers per hour versus time in hours. The line is flat at 12 kilometers per hour from time equals 0 to time equals 0 point 5 hours.](../resources/Figure_02_03_04.jpg "Position vs. time, velocity vs. time, and speed vs. time on a trip. Note that the velocity for the return trip is negative. ")

### Section Summary

* Time is measured in terms of change, and its SI unit is the second (s).
  Elapsed time for an event is
  <div class="equation">
  $$ \Delta t=t_{f}-t_{0}, $$
  </div>

where $$ t_{f} $$ is the final time and $$ t_{0} $$ is the initial time. The
initial time is often taken to be zero, as if measured with a stopwatch; the
elapsed time is then just $$ t $$.

* Average velocity $$ \overline{v} $$ is defined as displacement divided by the
  travel time. In symbols, average velocity is
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ \Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{ x_{\text{f}}-x_{0}}{ t_
{\text{f}}-t_{0}}. $$
  </div>

* The SI unit for velocity is m/s.
* Velocity is a vector and thus has a direction.
* Instantaneous velocity $$ v $$ is the velocity at a specific instant or the
  average velocity for an infinitesimal interval.
* Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity.
* Instantaneous speed is a scalar quantity, as it has no direction specified.
* Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. (
  Average speed is *not* the magnitude of the average velocity.) Speed is a
  scalar quantity; it has no direction associated with it.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
(a) Calculate Earth’s average speed relative to the Sun.
(b) What is its average velocity over a period of one year?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

For average speed, use distance traveled divided by time. For average velocity, use displacement divided by time.

**Solution**

**(a) Earth's average speed:**

1. Earth's orbital radius is approximately $$ 1.5 \times 10^{11} \m $$ (distance from Earth to Sun).

2. Calculate the circumference of Earth's orbit:
<div class="equation">
$$ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi \times 1.5 \times 10^{11} \m = 9.42 \times 10^{11} \m $$
</div>

3. Time for one orbit (1 year) in seconds:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = 365.25 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ h/day} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 3.16 \times 10^{7} \s $$
</div>

4. Calculate average speed:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Average speed} = \frac{C}{t} = \frac{9.42 \times 10^{11} \m}{3.16 \times 10^{7} \s} = 2.98 \times 10^{4} \ms \approx 3.0 \times 10^{4} \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Average velocity over one year:**

After one complete orbit, Earth returns to its starting position, so the displacement is zero:
<div class="equation">
$$ \overline{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{t} = \frac{0 \m}{t} = 0 \text{ m/s} $$
</div>

(a) $$ 3.0\times 10^{4} \ms $$

(b) 0 m/s

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
A helicopter blade spins at exactly 100 revolutions per minute. Its tip is 5.00 m from the center of rotation.
(a) Calculate the average speed of the blade tip in the helicopter's frame of reference.
(b) What is its average velocity over one revolution?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

To find average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the blade tip and divide by the time taken. For one revolution, the blade tip traces out a circle. Average velocity requires finding displacement, which is zero for a complete revolution.

**Solution**

Given:
- Rotation rate: 100 rev/min
- Radius: $$ r = 5.00 \m $$

**(a) Average speed:**

First, convert the rotation rate to revolutions per second:
<div class="equation">
$$ \text{rotation rate} = 100 \frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{1 \text{min}}{60 \s} = \frac{5}{3} \frac{\text{rev}}{\s} $$
</div>

The distance traveled in one revolution is the circumference of the circle:
<div class="equation">
$$ d = 2\pi r = 2\pi(5.00 \m) = 31.4 \m $$
</div>

The time for one revolution:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{1}{5/3 \text{ rev/s}} = \frac{3}{5} \s = 0.600 \s $$
</div>

Average speed:
<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{31.4 \m}{0.600 \s} = 52.4 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Average velocity over one revolution:**

After one complete revolution, the blade tip returns to its starting position. Therefore, the displacement is zero:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = 0 \m $$
</div>

Average velocity:
<div class="equation">
$$ \overline{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{t} = \frac{0 \m}{0.600 \s} = 0 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates the important distinction between speed and velocity. The blade tip is moving at a considerable speed (52.4 m/s), but because it returns to its starting point after each revolution, its average velocity is zero. This makes physical sense: velocity is a vector quantity that depends on displacement, while speed is a scalar that depends only on distance traveled. Circular motion always results in zero average velocity over complete cycles.

**Answer**

(a) The average speed of the blade tip is 52.4 m/s.

(b) The average velocity over one revolution is 0 m/s.

Land west of the San Andreas fault in southern California is moving at an average velocity of about 6 cm/y northwest relative to land east of the fault. Los Angeles is west of the fault and may thus someday be at the same latitude as San Francisco, which is east of the fault. How far in the future will this occur if the displacement to be made is 590 km northwest, assuming the motion remains constant?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to find the time required for a given displacement at constant velocity. Use the relationship $$ t = \frac{\Delta x}{v} $$, being careful to convert units consistently.

**Solution**

Given:
- Average velocity: $$ v = 6 \text{ cm/y} $$
- Displacement: $$ \Delta x = 590 \text{ km northwest} $$

First, convert the displacement to centimeters:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x = 590 \text{ km} \times \frac{1000 \m}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \m} = 5.90 \times 10^{7} \text{ cm} $$
</div>

Now calculate the time:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{\Delta x}{v} = \frac{5.90 \times 10^{7} \text{ cm}}{6 \text{ cm/y}} = 9.83 \times 10^{6} \text{ y} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result means it will take approximately 9.8 million years for Los Angeles to reach the same latitude as San Francisco, assuming constant motion. This is a reasonable timescale for geological processes. The calculation assumes the velocity remains constant, which is a simplification – actual tectonic motion can vary over such long periods. This problem illustrates how we can apply kinematics principles to very slow geological processes using the same equations we use for everyday motion.

**Answer**

Los Angeles will be at the same latitude as San Francisco in approximately $$ 9.8 \times 10^{6} $$ years (9.8 million years).

Tidal friction is slowing the rotation of the Earth. As a result, the
orbit of the Moon is increasing in radius at a rate of approximately 4 cm/year.
Assuming this to be a constant rate, how many years will pass before the radius
of the Moon's orbit increases by $$ 3.84 \times 10^{6} \m $$ (1%)?
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
**Strategy**

We need to find the time required for the Moon's orbital radius to increase by a given amount at a constant rate. Use $$ t = \frac{\Delta r}{v} $$ where $$ v $$ is the rate of change and $$ \Delta r $$ is the change in radius.

**Solution**

Given:
- Rate of orbital radius increase: $$ v = 4 \text{ cm/year} $$
- Change in radius: $$ \Delta r = 3.84 \times 10^{6} \m $$

First, convert the change in radius to centimeters:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta r = 3.84 \times 10^{6} \m \times \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \m} = 3.84 \times 10^{8} \text{ cm} $$
</div>

Now calculate the time:
<div class="equation">
$$ t = \frac{\Delta r}{v} = \frac{3.84 \times 10^{8} \text{ cm}}{4 \text{ cm/year}} = 9.6 \times 10^{7} \text{ years} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result of 96 million years is a very long time on human scales but not unreasonable for astronomical processes. The 1% increase in the Moon's orbital radius represents a significant change – the current Earth-Moon distance is approximately 384,000 km, so a 1% increase is 3,840 km. This gradual recession of the Moon is a real phenomenon caused by tidal interactions between Earth and the Moon. The energy for this comes from Earth's rotation, which is gradually slowing down as the Moon moves farther away, conserving angular momentum in the Earth-Moon system.

**Answer**

It will take $$ 9.6 \times 10^{7} $$ years (96 million years) for the Moon's orbital radius to increase by 1%.

**Discussion**

The result of 61 milliseconds (0.061 seconds) is the time it takes for a nerve signal to travel from your spinal cord to your feet. This seems quite fast, but it's actually relatively slow compared to electrical signals in wires, which travel near the speed of light. This delay is why your reaction time to step on something sharp isn't instantaneous – the signal must travel up to your brain and then back down to your muscles.

For comparison, if the signal were traveling at the speed of light ($$ 3 \times 10^8 \ms $$), it would take only about 3.7 nanoseconds to cover this distance – over 16 million times faster! The relatively slow speed of nerve impulses is due to the biological mechanism of signal propagation, which involves ion channels opening and closing sequentially along the axon rather than simple electron flow.

**Answer**

It takes 0.061 s (or 61 ms) for the nerve signal to travel from the spinal cord to the feet.

$$ \overline{v}_2 = \frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{-3.00 \m}{1.75 \s} = -1.71 \ms $$
</div>

**Interval 3: Breaking tackle and running forward**
<div class="equation">
$$ \overline{v}_3 = \frac{\Delta x_3}{\Delta t_3} = \frac{+21.0 \m}{5.20 \s} = +4.04 \ms $$
</div>

**(b) Average velocity for entire motion:**

Total displacement:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta x_{\text{total}} = \Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2 + \Delta x_3 = 15.0 \m + (-3.00 \m) + 21.0 \m = 33.0 \m $$
</div>

Total time:
<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta t_{\text{total}} = \Delta t_1 + \Delta t_2 + \Delta t_3 = 2.50 \s + 1.75 \s + 5.20 \s = 9.45 \s $$
</div>

Average velocity for entire motion:
<div class="equation">
$$ \overline{v}_{\text{total}} = \frac{\Delta x_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t_{\text{total}}} = \frac{33.0 \m}{9.45 \s} = 3.49 \ms $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The negative velocity in interval 2 indicates backward motion. The average velocity for the entire motion (3.49 m/s) is less than the average of the three interval velocities because the quarterback spent more time in the slower interval 3. The net displacement is 33.0 m forward, which makes sense: he moved forward 15.0 m, then backward 3.00 m (net 12.0 m forward so far), then forward another 21.0 m, giving a total of 33.0 m forward. This speed of 3.49 m/s is reasonable for a quarterback navigating through defenders – it's much slower than his sprint speed but accounts for the backward motion and the time spent breaking tackles.

**Answer**

(a) Interval 1: 6.00 m/s forward; Interval 2: 1.71 m/s backward; Interval 3: 4.04 m/s forward.

(b) The average velocity for the entire motion is 3.49 m/s forward.

The planetary model of the atom pictures electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus much
as planets orbit the Sun. In this model you can view hydrogen, the simplest
atom,as having a single electron in a circular orbit $$ 1.06 \times 10^{-10}
\m $$ in diameter.
(a) If the average speed of the electron in this orbit is known to
be $$ 2.20 \times 10^{6} \ms $$, calculate the number of revolutions per
second it makes about the nucleus.
(b) What is the electron’s average velocity during one revolution?
