* Explain the concept of particle-wave duality, and its scope.
</div>

**Particle-wave duality**—the fact that all particles have wave properties—is
one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics. We first came across it in the
treatment of photons, those particles of EM radiation that exhibit both particle
and wave properties, but not at the same time. Later it was noted that particles
of matter have wave properties as well. The dual properties of particles and
waves are found for all particles, whether massless like photons, or having a
mass like electrons. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

Part b shows a moving photon as a small ellipse enclosing a wave. An arrow shows the direction of the moving photon. The speed of photon is c.](../resources/Figure_29_08_01.jpg 'On a quantum-mechanical scale (i.e., very small), particles with and without mass have wave properties. For example, both electrons and photons have wavelengths but also behave as particles.')
{: #Figure1}

There are many submicroscopic particles in nature. Most have mass and are
expected to act as particles, or the smallest units of matter. All these masses
have wave properties, with wavelengths given by the de Broglie relationship
$$\lambda =h/p $$ . So, too, do combinations of these particles, such as nuclei,
atoms, and molecules. As a combination of masses becomes large, particularly if
it is large enough to be called macroscopic, its wave nature becomes difficult
to observe. This is consistent with our common experience with matter.

Some particles in nature are massless. We have only treated the photon so far,
but all massless entities travel at the speed of light, have a wavelength, and
exhibit particle and wave behaviors. They have momentum given by a rearrangement
of the de Broglie relationship, $$p=h/\lambda $$ . In large combinations of
these massless particles (such large combinations are common only for photons or
EM waves), there is mostly wave behavior upon detection, and the particle nature
becomes difficult to observe. This is also consistent with experience. (
See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

![A massive rock is shown on the left. A massless wave is shown on the right. The propagation of the wave is shown in three dimensional planes, with the variation of two components, E and B. E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the direction of vibrations. B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the E wave. The B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the B plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because E and B are perpendicular to each other. The direction of propagation of the wave is shown perpendicular to both E and B waves.](../resources/Figure_29_08_02.jpg 'On a classical scale (macroscopic), particles with mass behave as particles and not as waves. Particles without mass act as waves and not as particles.')

The particle-wave duality is a universal attribute. It is another connection
between matter and energy. Not only has modern physics been able to describe
nature for high speeds and small sizes, it has also discovered new connections
and symmetries. There is greater unity and symmetry in nature than was known in
the classical era—but they were dreamt of. A beautiful poem written by the
English poet William Blake some two centuries ago contains the following four
lines:

To see the World in a Grain of Sand

And a Heaven in a Wild Flower

Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand

And Eternity in an hour

### Integrated Concepts

The problem set for this section involves concepts from this chapter and several
others. Physics is most interesting when applied to general situations involving
more than a narrow set of physical principles. For example, photons have
momentum, hence the relevance of [Linear Momentum and Collisions](./ch8LinearMomentumAndCollisions). The
following topics are involved in some or all of the problems in this section:

- [Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion](./ch4Dynamics)
- [Work, Energy, and Energy Resources](./ch7WorkEnergyAndEnergyResources)
- [Linear Momentum and Collisions](./ch8LinearMomentumAndCollisions)
- [Heat and Heat Transfer Methods](../contents/ch14HeatAndHeatTransfers)
- [Electric Potential and Electric Field](../contents/ch19ElectricPotentialAndElectricEnergy)
- [Electric Current, Resistance, and Ohm’s Law](../contents/ch20ElectricCurrentResistanceAndOhmsLaw)
- [Wave Optics](../contents/ch27WaveOptics)
- [Special Relativity](../contents/ch28SpecialRelativity)

Recoil of a Dust Particle after Absorbing a Photon
</div>
The following topics are involved in this integrated concepts worked example:

            <td>Photons (quantum mechanics)</td>

A 550-nm photon (visible light) is absorbed by a  $$1.00\text{-μg} $$
 particle of dust in outer space. (a) Find the momentum of such a photon. (b) What is the recoil velocity of the particle of dust, assuming it is initially at rest?

**Strategy Step 1**

To solve an **integrated-concept problem**, such as those following this
example, we must first identify the physical principles involved and identify
the chapters in which they are found. Part (a) of this example asks for the **momentum of a photon**, a topic of the present chapter. Part (b) considers **recoil following a collision**, a topic
of [Linear Momentum and Collisions](./ch8LinearMomentumAndCollisions).

**Strategy Step 2**

The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how specific
problem-solving strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and
unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so on.

**Solution for (a)**

The momentum of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $$p=\frac{h}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Entering the known value for Planck’s constant  $$h $$
 and given the wavelength  $$\lambda  $$ ,  we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}p& =& \frac{ 6.63 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J}\cdot s}{550 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}}\\ & =&  1.21 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg}\cdot \text{m/s}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion for (a)**

This momentum is small, as expected from discussions in the text and the fact
that photons of visible light carry small amounts of energy and momentum
compared with those carried by macroscopic objects.

**Solution for (b)**

Conservation of momentum in the absorption of this photon by a grain of dust can
be analyzed using the equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $${p}_{1}+{p}_{2}=p^{\prime}_{1}+p^{\prime}_{2}\left({F}_{\text{net}}=0\right). $$
</div>
The net external force is zero, since the dust is in outer space. Let 1 represent the photon and 2 the dust particle. Before the collision, the dust is at rest (relative to some observer); after the collision, there is no photon (it is absorbed). So conservation of momentum can be written

<div class="equation" >
 $${p}_{1}=p^{\prime}_{2}=mv, $$
</div>
where  $${p}_{1} $$
 is the photon momentum before the collision and  $$p^{\prime}_{2} $$
 is the dust momentum after the collision. The mass and recoil velocity of the dust are  $$m $$
** and  $$v $$ ,
 respectively. Solving this for  $$v $$ ,
** the requested quantity, yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\frac{p}{m}, $$
</div>
where  $$p $$
 is the photon momentum found in part (a). Entering known values (noting that a microgram is  $$10^{-9} \text{kg} $$ ) 
gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}v& =& \frac{ 1.21 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg}\cdot \text{m/s}}{ 1.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{kg}}\\ & =&  1.21 \times 10^{-18} \text{m/s} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The recoil velocity of the particle of dust is extremely small. As we have
noted, however, there are immense numbers of photons in sunlight and other
macroscopic sources. In time, collisions and absorption of many photons could
cause a significant recoil of the dust, as observed in comet tails.

The 54.0-eV electron in [[Example 1]](../contents/ch29TheWaveNatureOfMatter#Example1) has a 0.167-nm
wavelength. If such electrons are passed through a double slit and have their
first maximum at an angle of $$ 25.0º $$ , what is the slit separation $$d $$ ?

An electron microscope produces electrons with a 2.00-pm wavelength. If these
are passed through a 1.00-nm single slit, at what angle will the first
diffraction minimum be found?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

This combines wave optics and matter waves. Use the single-slit diffraction formula for the first minimum: $$D \sin \theta = \lambda$$, where $$D$$ is the slit width.

**Solution**

For the first diffraction minimum:

<div class="equation">
 $$\sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{2.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}}{1.00 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}} = 0.00200$$
</div>

The angle is:

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = \arcsin(0.00200) = 0.115° = 6.88 \text{ arcminutes}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The first diffraction minimum occurs at only 0.115°, a very small angle. This tiny angle results because the electron wavelength (2.00 pm) is much smaller than the slit width (1.00 nm)—500 times smaller. Despite the small wavelength, the electron beam still exhibits clear diffraction, demonstrating the wave nature of matter. This diffraction must be accounted for in electron microscope design to achieve maximum resolution.

operator wait for their pasta to be ready?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Find photon energy from $$E = hf$$, then divide power by energy per photon. (b) Calculate heat needed using $$Q = mc\Delta T$$, then divide by energy per photon. (c) Divide total photons needed by photon rate.

**Solution for (a)**

Energy per photon:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = hf = (6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})(2560 \times 10^{6} \text{ Hz}) = 1.70 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Photons per second:

<div class="equation">
 $$N = \frac{P}{E} = \frac{900 \text{ W}}{1.70 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}} = 5.29 \times 10^{26} \text{ photons/s}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Heat required:

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = mc\Delta T = (0.500 \text{ kg})(0.900 \text{ kcal/kg·°C})(45.0\text{°C}) = 20.25 \text{ kcal}$$
</div>

Converting to joules (1 kcal = 4186 J):

<div class="equation">
 $$Q = 20.25 \text{ kcal} \times 4186 \text{ J/kcal} = 8.48 \times 10^{4} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Number of photons:

<div class="equation">
 $$N_{\text{total}} = \frac{Q}{E} = \frac{8.48 \times 10^{4} \text{ J}}{1.70 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}} = 4.99 \times 10^{28} \text{ photons}$$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

Time required:

<div class="equation">
 $$t = \frac{N_{\text{total}}}{N} = \frac{4.99 \times 10^{28}}{5.29 \times 10^{26} \text{ /s}} = 94.3 \text{ s} = 1.57 \text{ min}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The microwave oven emits over $$5 \times 10^{26}$$ photons per second, yet it takes nearly 100 seconds to heat the pasta because each individual photon carries so little energy ($$1.70 \times 10^{-24}$$ J). Nearly $$5 \times 10^{28}$$ photons are required to deliver the 84.8 kJ of thermal energy. This demonstrates why microwave radiation behaves classically—the sheer number of photons makes quantum effects unobservable.

Accelerator with a total energy of 50.0 GeV? (b) Find its momentum. (c) What is
the electron's wavelength?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Use $$\gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{mc^2}$$ where $$mc^2 = 0.511$$ MeV for an electron. (b) Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. (c) Use $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
 $$\gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{mc^2} = \frac{50.0 \times 10^{3} \text{ MeV}}{0.511 \text{ MeV}} = 9.78 \times 10^{4}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

For a highly relativistic particle, $$E \approx pc$$, so:

<div class="equation">
 $$p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{50.0 \times 10^{9} \text{ eV} \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 2.67 \times 10^{-17} \text{ kg·m/s}$$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2.67 \times 10^{-17} \text{ kg·m/s}} = 2.48 \times 10^{-17} \text{ m} = 0.0248 \text{ fm}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This electron has a Lorentz factor of nearly 100,000, meaning it's traveling at 0.9999999% of the speed of light. Its wavelength (0.0248 fm) is about 1/200 the size of a proton, making it suitable for probing quark structure inside nucleons. The Stanford Linear Accelerator produced such high-energy electrons to study the fundamental structure of matter at the smallest accessible scales.

An electron microscope passes 1.00-pm-wavelength electrons through a circular
aperture $$2.00 \text{μm} $$ in diameter. What is the angle between two
just-resolvable point sources for this microscope?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use the Rayleigh criterion for circular apertures: $$\theta = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}$$, where $$D$$ is the aperture diameter.

**Solution**

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D} = 1.22 \times \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}}{2.00 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = 6.10 \times 10^{-7} \text{ rad}$$
</div>

Converting to degrees:

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = 6.10 \times 10^{-7} \text{ rad} \times \frac{180°}{\pi} = 3.49 \times 10^{-5}°$$

<div class="equation">
 $$\theta = 3.49 \times 10^{-5}° \times 3600 \text{ arcsec/°} = 0.126 \text{ arcsec}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

The electron microscope can resolve points separated by an angle as small as $$6.10 \times 10^{-7}$$ radians or 0.126 arcseconds. This extraordinary resolution results from the extremely short wavelength (1.00 pm) of the electrons compared to the aperture size. This is about 500,000 times better angular resolution than the human eye and demonstrates why electron microscopes can image atomic-scale features. The resolution is limited only by the wavelength and aperture size, not by the wave nature of the electrons themselves.

**Solution for (a)**

Photon energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{400 \text{ nm}} = 3.10 \text{ eV} = 4.96 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Solution for (b)**

Electron kinetic energy:

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{KE}_e = E_{\text{photon}} - \text{BE} = 3.10 \text{ eV} - 2.71 \text{ eV} = 0.39 \text{ eV} = 6.24 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}$$

</div>

Charge needed:

 $$Q = CV = (2.00 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F})(0.39 \text{ V}) = 7.80 \times 10^{-13} \text{ C}$$
</div>

Time to accumulate this charge:

</div>

**Discussion**

The photoelectric effect produces a current of 0.645 mA, but this current is self-limiting on an insulated capacitor. Within just 1.21 nanoseconds, the capacitor charges to 0.39 V, creating an electric field that prevents further electrons from leaving the surface. This demonstrates how photoelectric devices can be sensitive to extremely small amounts of charge and explains why photodetectors often need grounding or discharge circuits.

momentum? (d) Calculate the electron's kinetic energy.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Use $$p = h/\lambda$$. (b) Use $$E = pc$$ for the photon. (c) Use relativistic momentum $$p = \gamma mv$$ and solve for $$v$$. (d) Use relativistic kinetic energy $$\text{KE} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$.

**Solution for (a)**

<div class="equation">
 $$p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{1.00 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}} = 6.63 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

<div class="equation">
 $$E = pc = (6.63 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s})(3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}) = 1.99 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Converting to MeV:

<div class="equation">
 $$E = \frac{1.99 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}}{1.60 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV}} = 1240 \text{ MeV} = 1.24 \text{ GeV}$$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

For a relativistic electron, use $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$E_e = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{(1.99 \times 10^{-10})^2 + (8.19 \times 10^{-14})^2} \approx 1.99 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}$$
</div>

Then $$\gamma = E_e/(mc^2) = 1.99 \times 10^{-10}/(8.19 \times 10^{-14}) = 2430$$

From $$\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$$:

<div class="equation">
 $$v = c\sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} = c\sqrt{1 - 1/2430^2} \approx 0.99999991c$$
</div>

**Solution for (d)**

<div class="equation">
 $$\text{KE} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (2430 - 1)(0.511 \text{ MeV}) = 1240 \text{ MeV} = 1.24 \text{ GeV}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

This 1-fm gamma ray carries enormous energy (1.24 GeV), typical of nuclear processes. An electron with the same momentum would be extremely relativistic ($$\gamma = 2430$$), traveling at 99.999991% the speed of light. Interestingly, the electron's kinetic energy nearly equals the photon energy because both are highly relativistic. Such high energies are needed to probe nuclear structure because the wavelength must be comparable to nuclear dimensions (1-10 fm).

**Integrated Concepts**

The momentum of light is exactly reversed when reflected straight back from a
mirror, assuming negligible recoil of the mirror. Thus the change in momentum is
twice the photon momentum. Suppose light of intensity $$1.00 {\text{kW/m}}^{2}
$$ reflects from a mirror of area $$2.00 {\text{m}}^{2} $$ .
(a) Calculate the energy reflected in 1.00 s. (b) What is the momentum imparted
to the mirror? (c) Using the most general form of Newton’s second law, what is
the force on the mirror? (d) Does the assumption of no mirror recoil seem
reasonable?

**Integrated Concepts**

Sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere has an intensity of $$ 1.30
{\text{kW/m}}^{2} $$ . If this is reflected straight back from a mirror that has
only a small recoil, the light's momentum is exactly reversed, giving the mirror
twice the incident momentum. (a) Calculate the force per square meter of
mirror. (b) Very low mass mirrors can be constructed in the near weightlessness
of space, and attached to a spaceship to sail it. Once done, the average mass
per square meter of the spaceship is 0.100 kg. Find the acceleration of the
spaceship if all other forces are balanced. (c) How fast is it moving 24 hours
later?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Power equals force times velocity: $$P = Fv$$, so $$F = P/c$$. Since momentum is reversed, the force doubles. (b) Use $$F = ma$$ to find acceleration. (c) Use $$v = at$$ assuming constant acceleration.

**Solution for (a)**

The momentum delivered per second (force) from absorbed light would be:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{absorbed}} = \frac{P}{c} = \frac{1.30 \times 10^{3} \text{ W/m}^2}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}} = 4.33 \times 10^{-6} \text{ N/m}^2$$
</div>

Since the light is reflected (momentum reversed), the force is doubled:

<div class="equation">
 $$F_{\text{reflected}} = 2F_{\text{absorbed}} = 2(4.33 \times 10^{-6}) = 8.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ N/m}^2$$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Acceleration:

<div class="equation">
 $$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{8.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ N/m}^2}{0.100 \text{ kg/m}^2} = 8.67 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m/s}^2$$
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

Time = 24 hours = 86,400 s:

<div class="equation">
 $$v = at = (8.67 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m/s}^2)(86,400 \text{ s}) = 7.49 \text{ m/s}$$
</div>

**Discussion**

Solar sailing is a real spacecraft propulsion concept! The radiation pressure produces only $$8.67 \times 10^{-6}$$ N/m² (less than one millionth of atmospheric pressure), but in space with very lightweight sails, meaningful acceleration is possible. After 24 hours, the spacecraft reaches 7.49 m/s (about 27 km/h). While slow, this acceleration continues indefinitely without fuel, allowing solar sails to eventually achieve high speeds over long interplanetary journeys. The key is minimizing mass per unit sail area—the lighter, the better. This technology has been demonstrated by missions like IKAROS and The Planetary Society's LightSail.
