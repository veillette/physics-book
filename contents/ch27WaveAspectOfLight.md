We know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes
respond. Like all other electromagnetic waves, it obeys the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$c=f\lambda \text{,} $$
</div>

where $$c=3 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $$f $$
is the frequency of the electromagnetic waves, and $$\lambda $$ is its
wavelength. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to 760 nm. As
is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when
it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However,
when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics
prominently. Interference is the hallmark of a wave, and
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be
seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory epitomizes a ray, traveling in a
straight line. However, passing a pure-wavelength beam through vertical slits
with a size close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of
light, as the beam spreads out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark
regions caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. Rather
than spreading out, a ray would continue traveling straight ahead after passing
through slits.

Making Connections: Waves
</div>
The most certain indication of a wave is interference. This wave characteristic is most prominent when the wave interacts with an object that is not large compared with the wavelength. Interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, light waves, and (as we will see in [Special Relativity](../contents/ch28SpecialRelativity)) for matter waves, such as electrons scattered from a crystal.

Light has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When
light goes from a vacuum to some medium, like water, its speed and wavelength
change, but its frequency $$f $$ remains the same. (We can think of light as a
forced oscillation that must have the frequency of the original source.) The
speed of light in a medium is $$v=c/n $$ , where $$n $$ is its index of
refraction. If we divide both sides of equation $$c=f\lambda $$ by $$n $$ , we
get $$c/n=v=f\lambda /n $$ . This implies that $$v=f{\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ ,
where $${\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ is the **wavelength in a medium** and that

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=\frac{\lambda }{n}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength in vacuum and $$n $$ is the medium’s index
of refraction. Therefore, the wavelength of light is smaller in any medium than
it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has $$n=1.333 $$ , the range of
visible wavelengths is $$\left(380 \text{nm}\right)/1.333 $$ to $$\left(760
\text{nm}\right)/1.333 $$ , or $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=285 \text{to} 570
\text{nm} $$ . Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to
another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency.

### Section Summary

- Wave optics is the branch of optics that must be used when light interacts
  with small objects or whenever the wave characteristics of light are
  considered.
- Wave characteristics are those associated with interference and diffraction.
- Visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes respond
  and has a wavelength in the range of 380 to 760 nm.
- Like all EM waves, the following relationship is valid in vacuum:
  $$c=f\lambda $$ , where $$c=3 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ is the speed of
  light, $$f $$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, and $$\lambda $$
  is its wavelength in vacuum.
- The wavelength $${\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ of light in a medium with index of
  refraction $$n $$ is $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=\lambda /n $$ . Its frequency is
  the same as in vacuum.

### Conceptual Questions

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What type of experimental evidence indicates that light is a wave?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

To identify light as a wave, we need experimental evidence that demonstrates wave-specific phenomena that cannot be explained by a particle model. The hallmark characteristics of waves include interference, diffraction, and polarization.

**Solution**

Several types of experimental evidence definitively indicate that light is a wave:

**1. Interference** - The most conclusive evidence that light is a wave is the observation of interference patterns. When two coherent light sources combine, they create alternating bright and dark regions (constructive and destructive interference) that can only be explained by wave superposition. Key experiments include Young's double-slit experiment, thin film interference (oil on water, soap bubbles), and interference in optical instruments.

**2. Diffraction** - Light bends around obstacles and spreads when passing through small apertures, creating characteristic diffraction patterns. Single-slit diffraction produces a central bright maximum with dimmer side maxima, a pattern inconsistent with particle behavior.

**3. Polarization** - Light can be polarized, demonstrating that it is a transverse wave. Particles do not exhibit polarization. Polarizing filters, Brewster's angle reflection, and birefringence all demonstrate light's transverse wave nature.

**4. Doppler effect** - The change in light frequency due to relative motion between source and observer (redshift/blueshift of stars) is a wave phenomenon.

**Discussion**

The wave nature of light was controversial historically. Newton favored a particle theory, while Huygens proposed a wave theory. Thomas Young's double-slit experiment (1801) provided compelling evidence for waves by demonstrating interference. This was confirmed by numerous subsequent experiments showing diffraction, polarization, and other wave phenomena. Interference remains the gold standard proof because it fundamentally cannot be explained by classical particles traveling in straight lines.

Give an example of a wave characteristic of light that is easily observed outside the laboratory.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to identify wave phenomena involving light that occur naturally or in everyday situations, observable without specialized equipment.

**Solution**

Several wave characteristics of light are easily observed in everyday life:

**1. Colors in soap bubbles and oil slicks** (thin film interference) - Perhaps the most commonly observed wave phenomenon. The swirling rainbow colors in soap bubbles, oil on water, or oxidized metal surfaces result from interference between light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of thin films. Different wavelengths interfere constructively at different angles, producing spectacular color patterns.

**2. Rainbows** (dispersion and refraction) - While primarily a refraction phenomenon, rainbows also involve wave properties. Different wavelengths are refracted by different amounts, separating white light into its component colors.

**3. Colors in peacock feathers, butterfly wings, and opals** (structural coloration/diffraction grating effects) - Many iridescent colors in nature result from periodic nanostructures that act as natural diffraction gratings, producing colors through wave interference rather than pigmentation.

**4. Halos and coronas around the sun or moon** - When light passes through ice crystals or water droplets in the atmosphere, diffraction creates colored rings around celestial objects.

**5. CDs and DVDs producing rainbow reflections** - The closely-spaced grooves on optical discs act as reflection gratings, separating light into its wavelength components.

**Discussion**

Thin film interference in soap bubbles is particularly instructive because it clearly demonstrates wave superposition. The colors change with viewing angle and film thickness, showing wavelength-dependent constructive and destructive interference. This phenomenon cannot be explained by light as simple particles but requires wave theory to understand why specific wavelengths are enhanced or suppressed at different positions.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problems-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Show that when light passes from air to water, its wavelength decreases to 0.750 times its original value.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

When light enters a medium, its wavelength changes according to the relationship $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$, where $$\lambda_n$$ is the wavelength in the medium, $$\lambda$$ is the wavelength in vacuum (or air), and $$n$$ is the index of refraction. For water, $$n = 1.333$$.

**Solution**

Given:
- Index of refraction of water: $$n = 1.333$$

The wavelength in water is related to the wavelength in air by:
<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda_{\text{water}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{air}}}{n} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{air}}}{1.333}$$
</div>

Calculate the ratio:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{\lambda_{\text{water}}}{\lambda_{\text{air}}} = \frac{1}{1.333} = 0.750$$
</div>

Therefore:
<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda_{\text{water}} = 0.750 \times \lambda_{\text{air}}$$
</div>

**This shows that the wavelength in water is 0.750 times (or 75.0% of) its value in air.**

**Discussion**

The 25% reduction in wavelength occurs because light slows down when entering water. The speed of light in water is $$v = c/n = c/1.333 \approx 0.750c$$. Since the frequency remains constant when light enters a new medium (it's determined by the source), and $$v = f\lambda$$, a 25% reduction in speed must be accompanied by a 25% reduction in wavelength. This wavelength reduction is important in thin film interference and other wave phenomena involving light in different media.

Find the range of visible wavelengths of light in crown glass.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The wavelength of light changes when it enters a medium according to $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$, where $$\lambda$$ is the wavelength in vacuum, $$n$$ is the index of refraction, and $$\lambda_n$$ is the wavelength in the medium. For crown glass, $$n = 1.52$$. The visible range in vacuum is 380 nm to 760 nm.

**Solution**

Given:
- Visible wavelength range in vacuum: 380 nm to 760 nm
- Index of refraction of crown glass: $$n = 1.52$$

For the shortest visible wavelength (violet):
<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n} = \frac{380 \text{ nm}}{1.52} = 250 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

For the longest visible wavelength (red):
<div class="equation">
 $$\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n} = \frac{760 \text{ nm}}{1.52} = 500 \text{ nm}$$
</div>

**The range of visible wavelengths in crown glass is 250 nm to 500 nm.**

**Discussion**

Notice that wavelengths in crown glass are about 66% (or 1/1.52) of their values in vacuum. Even though the wavelengths change significantly, the colors we perceive remain the same because color is determined by frequency, which does not change when light enters a medium. The speed and wavelength both decrease by the factor $$n$$, but their ratio ($$v = f\lambda_n$$) maintains the same frequency.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the index of refraction of a material for which the wavelength of light is 0.671 times its value in a vacuum? Identify the likely substance.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We use the relationship $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$ to find the index of refraction $$n$$. Rearranging gives $$n = \lambda/\lambda_n$$. Given that $$\lambda_n = 0.671\lambda$$, we can find $$n$$ and compare it to known values for common materials.

**Solution**

Given:
- $$\lambda_n = 0.671 \times \lambda$$

From $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$:
<div class="equation">
 $$n = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} = \frac{\lambda}{0.671\lambda} = \frac{1}{0.671}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$n = 1.49$$
</div>

Comparing to known indices of refraction:
- Water: $$n = 1.33$$
- Glass (typical): $$n = 1.5-1.9$$
- **Polystyrene**: $$n = 1.49$$
- Plexiglass: $$n = 1.51$$

**The material is most likely polystyrene, which has an index of refraction of 1.49.**

**Discussion**

Polystyrene is a common transparent plastic used in many applications including optical components, disposable containers, and laboratory equipment. The calculated index of refraction matches polystyrene almost exactly. While plexiglass (acrylic) has a similar value (1.51), the calculated value of 1.49 is closer to polystyrene. The wavelength reduction to 67.1% of its vacuum value is typical for transparent plastics and glasses, which generally have indices between 1.4 and 1.6.

Analysis of an interference effect in a clear solid shows that the wavelength of light in the solid is 329 nm. Knowing this light comes from a He-Ne laser and has a wavelength of 633 nm in air, is the substance zircon or diamond?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We can find the index of refraction of the unknown substance using $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$, which gives $$n = \lambda/\lambda_n$$. Then compare this value to known indices of refraction: zircon ($$n \approx 1.92$$) and diamond ($$n \approx 2.42$$).

**Solution**

Given:
- Wavelength in air (approximately vacuum): $$\lambda = 633 \text{ nm}$$
- Wavelength in the solid: $$\lambda_n = 329 \text{ nm}$$

Calculate the index of refraction:
<div class="equation">
 $$n = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} = \frac{633 \text{ nm}}{329 \text{ nm}} = 1.92$$
</div>

Comparing to known values:
- Zircon: $$n \approx 1.92$$
- Diamond: $$n \approx 2.42$$

**The substance is zircon**, as its index of refraction matches the calculated value of 1.92.

**Discussion**

Diamond has a much higher index of refraction (2.42) and would reduce the wavelength to approximately $$633/2.42 = 262$$ nm, which is significantly less than the observed 329 nm. Zircon's lower index of refraction produces the observed wavelength. This method of using interference patterns to measure wavelength in materials is a practical way to identify transparent substances or verify their purity, since the index of refraction is a characteristic property of each material.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
What is the ratio of thicknesses of crown glass and water that would contain the same number of wavelengths of light?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The number of wavelengths that fit in a given thickness $$t$$ is $$N = t/\lambda_n$$. For the same number of wavelengths in both materials, we need $$t_{\text{glass}}/\lambda_{\text{glass}} = t_{\text{water}}/\lambda_{\text{water}}$$. Using $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$, we can find the thickness ratio.

**Solution**

Given:
- Crown glass: $$n_{\text{glass}} = 1.52$$
- Water: $$n_{\text{water}} = 1.333$$

For the same number of wavelengths:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{t_{\text{glass}}}{\lambda_{\text{glass}}} = \frac{t_{\text{water}}}{\lambda_{\text{water}}}$$
</div>

Since $$\lambda_n = \lambda/n$$:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{t_{\text{glass}}}{\lambda/n_{\text{glass}}} = \frac{t_{\text{water}}}{\lambda/n_{\text{water}}}$$
</div>

Simplifying:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{t_{\text{glass}} \cdot n_{\text{glass}}}{\lambda} = \frac{t_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{water}}}{\lambda}$$
</div>

<div class="equation">
 $$t_{\text{glass}} \cdot n_{\text{glass}} = t_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{water}}$$
</div>

Therefore:
<div class="equation">
 $$\frac{t_{\text{glass}}}{t_{\text{water}}} = \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{glass}}} = \frac{1.333}{1.52} = 0.877$$
</div>

**The ratio of crown glass thickness to water thickness is 0.877 (or approximately 7:8).**

**Discussion**

This result shows that crown glass needs to be only 87.7% as thick as water to contain the same number of wavelengths. This makes sense because crown glass has a higher index of refraction (1.52) than water (1.333), which means light wavelengths are more compressed in glass than in water. The higher the index of refraction, the shorter the wavelength becomes in that medium, so fewer physical distance is needed to accommodate a given number of wavelengths.

This relationship is important in optical design, where the optical path length ($$n \times t$$) determines phase relationships in interference and other wave phenomena. Two different materials with different thicknesses can produce the same optical path length if the product $$nt$$ is equal for both.
