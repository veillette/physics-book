The great Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962) made immediate use of
Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom. ([[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Bohr became
convinced of its validity and spent part of 1912 at Rutherford’s laboratory. In
1913, after returning to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the
simplest atom, hydrogen, based on the planetary model of the atom. For decades,
many questions had been asked about atomic characteristics. From their sizes to
their spectra, much was known about atoms, but little had been explained in
terms of the laws of physics. Bohr’s theory explained the atomic spectrum of
hydrogen and established new and broadly applicable principles in quantum
mechanics.

### Mysteries of Atomic Spectra

As noted in [Quantization of Energy](../contents/ch29QuantizationOfEnergy) , the energies of some small
systems are quantized. Atomic and molecular emission and absorption spectra have
been known for over a century to be discrete (or quantized). (
See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) Maxwell and others had realized that there must be
a connection between the spectrum of an atom and its structure, something like
the resonant frequencies of musical instruments. But, in spite of years of
efforts by many great minds, no one had a workable theory. (It was a running
joke that any theory of atomic and molecular spectra could be destroyed by
throwing a book of data at it, so complex were the spectra.) Following
Einstein’s proposal of photons with quantized energies directly proportional to
their wavelengths, it became even more evident that electrons in atoms can exist
only in discrete orbits.

![This figure has two parts. Part a shows a discharge tube at the extreme left. Light from the discharge tube passes through a rectangular slit and a grating, going from left to right. From the grating, light of different colors falls on a photographic film. Part b of the figure shows the emission line spectrum for iron.](../resources/Figure_30_03_02.jpg 'Part (a) shows, from left to right, a discharge tube, slit, and diffraction grating producing a line spectrum. Part (b) shows the emission line spectrum for iron. The discrete lines imply quantized energy states for the atoms that produce them. The line spectrum for each element is unique, providing a powerful and much used analytical tool, and many line spectra were well known for many years before they could be explained with physics.

{: #Figure2}

In some cases, it had been possible to devise formulas that described the
emission spectra. As you might expect, the simplest atom—hydrogen, with its
single electron—has a relatively simple spectrum. The hydrogen spectrum had been
observed in the infrared (IR), visible, and ultraviolet (UV), and several series
of spectral lines had been observed. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) These series
are named after early researchers who studied them in particular depth.

The observed **hydrogen-spectrum wavelengths** can be calculated using the
following formula:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right), $$
</div>

where $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength of the emitted EM radiation and $$R $$ is
the **Rydberg constant**, determined by the experiment to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$R= 1.097 \times 10^{7} /\text{m} \left({\text{or m}}^{-1}\right). $$
</div>

The constant $${n}_{\text{f}} $$ is a positive integer associated with a
specific series. For the Lyman series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=1 $$ ; for the Balmer
series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ ; for the Paschen series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=3 $$ ;
and so on. The Lyman series is entirely in the UV, while part of the Balmer
series is visible with the remainder UV. The Paschen series and all the rest are
entirely IR. There are apparently an unlimited number of series, although they
lie progressively farther into the infrared and become difficult to observe as
$${n}_{\text{f}} $$ increases. The constant $${n}_{\text{i}} $$ is a positive
integer, but it must be greater than $${n}_{\text{f}} $$ . Thus, for the Balmer
series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ and $${n}_{\text{i}}=3, 4, 5, 6, ... $$ . Note
that $${n}_{\text{i}} $$ can approach infinity. While the formula in the
wavelengths equation was just a recipe designed to fit data and was not based on
physical principles, it did imply a deeper meaning. Balmer first devised the
formula for his series alone, and it was later found to describe all the other
series by using different values of $${n}_{\text{f}} $$ . Bohr was the first to
comprehend the deeper meaning. Again, we see the interplay between experiment
and theory in physics. Experimentally, the spectra were well established, an
equation was found to fit the experimental data, but the theoretical foundation
was missing.

![The figure shows three horizontal lines at small distances from each other. Between the two lower lines, the Lyman series, with four vertical red bands in compact form, is shown. The value of the constant n sub f is 1 and the wavelengths are ninety-one nanometers to one hundred nanometers. The Balmer series is shown to the right side of this series. The value of the constant n sub f is two, and the range of wavelengths is from three hundred sixty five to six hundred fifty six nanometers. At the right side of this, the Paschen series bands are shown. The value of the constant n sub f is three, and the range of the wavelengths is from eight hundred twenty nanometers to one thousand eight hundred and seventy five nanometers.](../resources/Figure_30_03_03.jpg 'A schematic of the hydrogen spectrum shows several series named for those who contributed most to their determination.

<div class="title">
Calculating Wave Interference of a Hydrogen Line
</div>
What is the distance between the slits of a grating that produces a first-order maximum for the second Balmer line at an angle of  $$15 ^\circ $$ ?

**Strategy and Concept**

For an Integrated Concept problem, we must first identify the physical
principles involved. In this example, we need to know (a) the wavelength of
light as well as (b) conditions for an interference maximum for the pattern from
a double slit. Part (a) deals with a topic of the present chapter, while part (
b) considers the wave interference material of [Wave Optics](../contents/ch27WaveOptics).

**Solution for (a)**

**Hydrogen spectrum wavelength**. The Balmer series requires that $${n}_
{\text{f}}=2 $$ . The first line in the series is taken to be for $${n}_
{\text{i}}=3 $$ , and so the second would have $${n}_{\text{i}}=4 $$.

The calculation is a straightforward application of the wavelength equation.
Entering the determined values for $${n}_{\text{f}} $$ and $${n}_{\text{i}} $$
yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\frac{1}{\lambda }& =& R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{f}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{i}^{2}}\right)\\ & =& \left( 1.097 \times 10^{7}  {\text{m}}^{-1}\right)\left(\frac{1}{ {2}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {4}^{2}}\right)\\ & =&  2.057 \times 10^{6}  {\text{m}}^{-1}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
Inverting to find  $$\lambda  $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\lambda & =& \frac{1}{ 2.057 \times 10^{6}  {\text{m}}^{-1}}=486 \times 10^{-9}  \text{m}\\ & =& 486 \text{nm} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion for (a)**

This is indeed the experimentally observed wavelength, corresponding to the
second (blue-green) line in the Balmer series. More impressive is the fact that
the same simple recipe predicts _all_ of the hydrogen spectrum lines, including
new ones observed in subsequent experiments. What is nature telling us?

**Solution for (b)**

**Double-slit interference** ([Wave Optics](../contents/ch27WaveOptics)). To obtain constructive
interference for a double slit, the path length difference from two slits must
be an integral multiple of the wavelength. This condition was expressed by the
equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$d \sin \theta =m \lambda\text{,} $$
</div>
where  $$d $$
 is the distance between slits and  $$\theta  $$
 is the angle from the original direction of the beam. The number  $$m $$
 is the order of the interference;  $$m=1 $$
 in this example. Solving for  $$d $$  and entering known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$d=\frac{\left(1\right)\left(486 \text{nm}\right)}{\sin 15\text{º}}= 1.88 \times 10^{-6}  \text{m}. $$
</div>
**Discussion for (b)**

This number is similar to those used in the interference examples
of [Introduction to Quantum Physics](../contents/ch29QuantumPhysics) (and is close to the spacing
between slits in commonly used diffraction glasses).

### Bohr’s Solution for Hydrogen

Bohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic
physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some very important new proposals.
His first proposal is that only certain orbits are allowed: we say that _the
orbits of electrons in atoms are quantized_. Each orbit has a different energy,
and electrons can move to a higher orbit by absorbing energy and drop to a lower
orbit by emitting energy. If the orbits are quantized, the amount of energy
absorbed or emitted is also quantized, producing discrete spectra. Photon
absorption and emission are among the primary methods of transferring energy
into and out of atoms. The energies of the photons are quantized, and their
energy is explained as being equal to the change in energy of the electron when
it moves from one orbit to another. In equation form, this is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta E= hf={E}_{i}-{E}_{f}. $$
</div>

Here, $$\Delta E $$ is the change in energy between the initial and final
orbits, and $$ hf $$ is the energy of the absorbed or emitted photon. It is
quite logical (that is, expected from our everyday experience) that energy is
involved in changing orbits. A blast of energy is required for the space
shuttle, for example, to climb to a higher orbit. What is not expected is that
atomic orbits should be quantized. This is not observed for satellites or
planets, which can have any orbit given the proper energy. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).)

![The orbits of Bohr’s planetary model of an atom; five concentric circles are shown. The radii of the circles increase from innermost to outermost circles. On the circles, labels E sub one, E sub two, up to E sub i are marked.](../resources/Figure_30_03_04.jpg 'The planetary model of the atom, as modified by Bohr, has the orbits of the electrons quantized. Only certain orbits are allowed, explaining why atomic spectra are discrete (quantized). The energy carried away from an atom by a photon comes from the electron dropping from one allowed orbit to another and is thus quantized. This is likewise true for atomic absorption of photons.')
{: #Figure4}

[[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows an **energy-level diagram**, a convenient way to
display energy states. In the present discussion, we take these to be the
allowed energy levels of the electron. Energy is plotted vertically with the
lowest or ground state at the bottom and with excited states above. Given the
energies of the lines in an atomic spectrum, it is possible (although sometimes
very difficult) to determine the energy levels of an atom. Energy-level diagrams
are used for many systems, including molecules and nuclei. A theory of the atom
or any other system must predict its energies based on the physics of the
system.

![The energy level diagram is shown. A number of horizontal lines are shown. The lines are labeled from bottom to top as n is equal to one, n is equal to two and so on up to n equals infinity; the energy levels increase from bottom to top. The distance between the lines decreases from the bottom line to the top line. A vertical arrow shows an electron transitioning from n equals four to n equals two.](../resources/Figure_30_03_05.jpg 'An energy-level diagram plots energy vertically and is useful in visualizing the energy states of a system and the transitions between them. This diagram is for the hydrogen-atom electrons, showing a transition between two orbits having energies ( E_{4} ) and ( E_{2} ) .')
{: #Figure5}

Bohr was clever enough to find a way to calculate the electron orbital energies
in hydrogen. This was an important first step that has been improved upon, but
it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many
characteristics of hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the **angular momentum $$L $$ of an electron in its orbit is quantized**, that is, it
has only specific, discrete values. The value for $$L $$ is given by the formula

<div class="equation" >
 $$L={m}_{e}vr_{n}=n\frac{h}{2\pi }\left(n=1, 2, 3,\dots \right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$L $$ is the angular momentum, $${m}_{e} $$ is the electron’s mass,
$${r}\_{n} $$ is the radius of the $$n $$ th orbit, and $$h $$ is Planck’s
constant. Note that angular momentum is $$L=\mathrm{I\omega } $$ . For a small
object at a radius $$r, I={\text{mr}}^{2} $$ and $$\omega =v/r $$ , so that
$$L=\left({\text{mr}}^{2}\right)\left(v/r\right)=\text{mvr} $$ . Quantization
says that this value of $$\text{mvr} $$ can only be equal to $$h/2, 2h/2, 3h/2

$$
, etc. At the time, Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be
quantized, but using this assumption he was able to calculate the energies in
the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time.

From Bohr’s assumptions, we will now derive a number of important properties of
the hydrogen atom from the classical physics we have covered in the text. We
start by noting the centripetal force causing the electron to follow a circular
path is supplied by the Coulomb force. To be more general, we note that this
analysis is valid for any single-electron atom. So, if a nucleus has $$Z $$
protons ( $$Z=1 $$ for hydrogen, 2 for helium, etc.) and only one electron, that
atom is called a **hydrogen-like atom**. The spectra of hydrogen-like ions are
similar to hydrogen, but shifted to higher energy by the greater attractive
force between the electron and nucleus. The magnitude of the centripetal force
is $${m}_{e}{v}^{2}/{r}_{n} $$ , while the Coulomb force is $$k\left(
{\text{Zq}}_{e}\right)\left({q}_{e}\right)/{r}_{n}^{2} $$ . The tacit assumption
here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the
electron orbits about it. This is consistent with the planetary model of the
atom. Equating these,

<div class="equation" >
 $$k\frac{ {\text{Zq}}_{e}^{2}}{ {r}_{n}^{2}}=\frac{ {m}_{e}{v}^{2}}{ {r}_{n}}\left(Coulomb = centripetal\right). $$
</div>

Angular momentum quantization is stated in an earlier equation. We solve that
equation for $$v $$ , substitute it into the above, and rearrange the expression
to obtain the radius of the orbit. This yields:

<div class="equation" >
 $${r}_{n}=\frac{ {n}^{2}}{Z}{a}_{\text{B}}\text{, for allowed orbits}\left(n=1,2,3,\dots \right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where $${a}_{\text{B}} $$ is defined to be the **Bohr radius**, since for the
lowest orbit $$\left(n=1\right) $$ and for hydrogen $$\left(Z=1\right) $$ ,
$${r}_{1}={a}_{\text{B}} $$ . It is left for this chapter’s Problems and
Exercises to show that the Bohr radius is

<div class="equation" >
 $${a}_{\text{B}}=\frac{ {h}^{2}}{ {4\pi }^{2}{m}_{e}k q_{e}^{2}}= 0.529 \times 10^{-10}  \text{m}. $$
</div>

These last two equations can be used to calculate the **radii of the allowed (
quantized) electron orbits in any hydrogen-like atom**. It is impressive that
the formula gives the correct size of hydrogen, which is measured experimentally
to be very close to the Bohr radius. The earlier equation also tells us that the
orbital radius is proportional to $${n}^{2} $$ , as illustrated
in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).

![The electron orbits are shown in the form of four concentric circles. The radius of each circle is marked as r sub one, r sub two, up to r sub four.](../resources/Figure_30_03_06.jpg "The allowed electron orbits in hydrogen have the radii shown. These radii were first calculated by Bohr and are given by the equation \( r_n=n^2/Z a_B \). The lowest orbit has the experimentally verified diameter of a hydrogen atom.")
{: #Figure6}

To get the electron orbital energies, we start by noting that the electron
energy is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy:

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{n}=\text{KE}+\text{PE}. $$
</div>

Kinetic energy is the familiar $$\text{KE}=\left(1/2\right){m}_{e}{v}^{2} $$ ,
assuming the electron is not moving at relativistic speeds. Potential energy for
the electron is electrical, or $$\text{PE}={q}_{e}V $$ , where $$V $$ is the
potential due to the nucleus, which looks like a point charge. The nucleus has a
positive charge $$ Zq_{e} $$ ; thus, $$V= kZq_{e}/{r}_{n} $$ , recalling an
earlier equation for the potential due to a point charge. Since the electron’s
charge is negative, we see that $$\text{PE}=-kZq_{e}/{r}_{n} $$ . Entering the
expressions for $$\text{KE} $$ and $$\text{PE} $$ , we find

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{n}=\frac{1}{2}{m}_{e}{v}^{2}-k\frac{ {\text{Zq}}_{e}^{2}}{ {r}_{n}}. $$
</div>

Now we substitute $${r}_{n} $$ and $$v $$ from earlier equations into the above
expression for energy. Algebraic manipulation yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{n}=-\frac{ {Z}^{2}}{ {n}^{2}}{E}_{0}\left(n=1 \text{, 2, 3, ...}\right) $$
</div>

for the orbital **energies of hydrogen-like atoms**. Here, $${E}_{0} $$ is
the **ground-state energy** $$\left(n=1\right) $$ for hydrogen
$$\left(Z=1\right) $$ and is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{0}=\frac{ {2\pi }^{2}{q}_{e}^{4}{m}_{e}{k}^{2}}{ {h}^{2}}=13.6 \text{eV} \text{.}  $$
</div>

Thus, for hydrogen,

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{n}=-\frac{13.6 \text{eV}}{ {n}^{2}} \left( n=1 \text{, 2, 3, ...} \right) \text{.} $$
</div>

[[Figure 7]](#Figure7) shows an energy-level diagram for hydrogen that also
illustrates how the various spectral series for hydrogen are related to
transitions between energy levels.

![An energy level diagram is shown. At the left, there is a vertical arrow showing the energy levels increasing from bottom to top. At the bottom, there is a horizontal line showing the energy levels of Lyman series, n is one. The energy is marked as negative thirteen point six electron volt. Then, in the upper half of the figure, another horizontal line showing Balmer series is shown when the value of n is two. The energy level is labeled as negative three point four zero electron volt. Above it there is another horizontal line showing Paschen series. The energy level is marked as negative one point five one electron volt. Above this line, some more lines are shown in a small area to show energy levels of other values of n.](../resources/Figure_30_03_07.jpg "Energy-level diagram for hydrogen showing the Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen series of transitions. The orbital energies are calculated using the above equation, first derived by Bohr.")
{: #Figure7}

Electron total energies are negative, since the electron is bound to the
nucleus, analogous to being in a hole without enough kinetic energy to escape.
As $$n $$ approaches infinity, the total energy becomes zero. This corresponds
to a free electron with no kinetic energy, since $${r}_{n} $$ gets very large
for large $$n $$ , and the electric potential energy thus becomes zero. Thus,
13.6 eV is needed to ionize hydrogen (to go from –13.6 eV to 0, or unbound), an
experimentally verified number. Given more energy, the electron becomes unbound
with some kinetic energy. For example, giving 15.0 eV to an electron in the
ground state of hydrogen strips it from the atom and leaves it with 1.4 eV of
kinetic energy.

Finally, let us consider the energy of a photon emitted in a downward
transition, given by the equation to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta E= hf={E}_{\text{i}}-{E}_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>

Substituting $${E}_{n}=\left(-13.6 \text{eV}/{n}^{2}\right) $$ , we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$ hf=\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right). $$
</div>

Dividing both sides of this equation by $$hc $$ gives an expression for
$$1/\lambda $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{ hf}{hc}=\frac{f}{c}=\frac{1}{\lambda }=\frac{\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)}{hc}\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right). $$
</div>

It can be shown that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\left(\frac{13.6 \text{eV}}{hc}\right)=\frac{\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)\left(1.602 \times 10^{\text{−19}} \text{J/eV}\right)}{\left(6.626 \times 10^{\text{−34}} \text{J·s}\right)\left( 2.998 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)}= 1.097 \times 10^{7}  {\text{m}}^{-1}=R $$
</div>

is the **Rydberg constant**. Thus, we have used Bohr’s assumptions to derive the
formula first proposed by Balmer years earlier as a recipe to fit experimental
data.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right) $$
</div>

We see that Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom answers the question as to why
this previously known formula describes the hydrogen spectrum. It is because the
energy levels are proportional to $$1/{n}^{2} $$ , where $$n $$ is a
non-negative integer. A downward transition releases energy, and so $${n}_{i} $$
must be greater than $${n}_{\text{f}} $$ . The various series are those where
the transitions end on a certain level. For the Lyman series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=1
$$ — that is, all the transitions end in the ground state (see
also [[Figure 7]](#Figure7)). For the Balmer series, $${n}_{\text{f}}=2 $$ , or
all the transitions end in the first excited state; and so on. What was once a
recipe is now based in physics, and something new is emerging—angular momentum
is quantized.

### Triumphs and Limits of the Bohr Theory

Bohr did what no one had been able to do before. Not only did he explain the
spectrum of hydrogen, he correctly calculated the size of the atom from basic
physics. Some of his ideas are broadly applicable. Electron orbital energies are
quantized in all atoms and molecules. Angular momentum is quantized. The
electrons do not spiral into the nucleus, as expected classically (accelerated
charges radiate, so that the electron orbits classically would decay quickly,
and the electrons would sit on the nucleus—matter would collapse). These are
major triumphs.

But there are limits to Bohr’s theory. It cannot be applied to multielectron
atoms, even one as simple as a two-electron helium atom. Bohr’s model is what we
call *semiclassical*. The orbits are quantized (nonclassical) but are assumed to
be simple circular paths (classical). As quantum mechanics was developed, it
became clear that there are no well-defined orbits; rather, there are clouds of
probability. Bohr’s theory also did not explain that some spectral lines are
doublets (split into two) when examined closely. We shall examine many of these
aspects of quantum mechanics in more detail, but it should be kept in mind that
Bohr did not fail. Rather, he made very important steps along the path to
greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has
since evolved.

### Section Summary

* The planetary model of the atom pictures electrons orbiting the nucleus in the
  way that planets orbit the sun. Bohr used the planetary model to develop the
  first reasonable theory of hydrogen, the simplest atom. Atomic and molecular
  spectra are quantized, with hydrogen spectrum wavelengths given by the formula
  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{1}{\lambda }=R\left(\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{f}}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ {n}_{\text{i}}^{2}}\right), $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\lambda  $$ is the wavelength of the emitted EM radiation and
   $$R $$ is the Rydberg constant, which has the value
  <div class="equation" >
   $$R= 1.097 \times 10^{7}  {\text{m}}^{-1}\text{.} $$
  </div>

* The constants $${n}_{i} $$ and $${n}_{f} $$ are positive integers, and $${n}_{i} $$ must be greater than $${n}_{f} $$ .

* Bohr correctly proposed that the energy and radii of the orbits of electrons
  in atoms are quantized, with energy for transitions between orbits given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$\Delta E= hf={E}_{\text{i}}-{E}_{\text{f}}, $$
  </div>
  where $$\Delta E $$ is the change in energy between the initial and final orbits and $$ hf $$ is the energy of an absorbed or emitted photon. It is useful to plot orbital energies on a vertical graph called an energy-level diagram.
* Bohr proposed that the allowed orbits are circular and must have quantized
  orbital angular momentum given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $$L={m}_{e}vr_{n}=n\frac{h}{2\pi } \text{ where } \left( n=1, 2, 3 \dots \right), $$
  </div>

  where $$L $$ is the angular momentum, $${r}_{n} $$ is the radius of the $$n\text{th} $$ orbit, and $$h $$
 is Planck’s constant. For all one-electron (hydrogen-like) atoms, the radius of an orbit is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${r}_{n}=\frac{ {n}^{2}}{Z}{a}_{\text{B}}  \text{ where } \left( \text{ allowed orbits } n=1, 2, 3, ...\right), $$
  </div>

  $$Z $$ is the atomic number of an element (the number of electrons is has when
  neutral) and $${a}_{\text{B}} $$ is defined to be the Bohr radius, which is
  <div class="equation" >
   $${a}_{\text{B}}=\frac{ {h}^{2}}{ {4\pi }^{2}{m}_{e} k q_{e}^{2}}= 0.529 \times 10^{-10}  \text{m}\text{.} $$
  </div>

* Furthermore, the energies of hydrogen-like atoms are given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${E}_{n}=-\frac{ {Z}^{2}}{ {n}^{2}}{E}_{0} \text{ where } \left(n=1, 2, 3 ...\right)\text{,} $$
  </div>

  where $${E}_{0} $$ is the ground-state energy and is given by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${E}_{0}=\frac{ 2\pi^{2}{q}_{e}^{4}{m}_{e}{k}^{2}}{ {h}^{2}}=13.6 \text{eV} \text{.}  $$
  </div>

  Thus, for hydrogen,
  <div class="equation" >
   $${E}_{n}=-\frac{13.6 \text{eV}}{ {n}^{2}}\text{ where } \left(n= 1, 2, 3 ...\right)\text{.} $$
  </div>

* The Bohr Theory gives accurate values for the energy levels in hydrogen-like
  atoms, but it has been improved upon in several respects.

By calculating its wavelength, show that the first line in the Lyman series is UV radiation.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The Lyman series corresponds to transitions ending at the ground state, so $$ n_{\text{f}} = 1 $$ . The first line in the series corresponds to a transition from $$ n_i = 2 $$ to $$ n_f = 1 $$ . We'll use the Rydberg formula to calculate the wavelength and determine if it falls in the UV region (wavelengths less than 400 nm).

**Solution**

Using the Rydberg formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{f}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
</div>

With $$ n_{\text{f}} = 1 $$ and $$ n_i = 2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2} \right) = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{4} \right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) = 8.228 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{1}{8.228 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 1.22 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 122 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

Since 122 nm is much less than 400 nm (the lower limit of visible light), this is indeed **UV radiation**.

**Discussion**

The entire Lyman series lies in the ultraviolet region because these transitions all end at the ground state (n = 1), involving relatively large energy changes. The first line at 122 nm (also called Lyman-alpha) is the longest wavelength and lowest energy transition in this series. As we move to higher lines in the series (from n = 3, 4, 5, ... to n = 1), the wavelengths get progressively shorter, approaching the series limit at 91.2 nm as n approaches infinity. This UV radiation from hydrogen is important in astronomy—Lyman-alpha is one of the most studied spectral lines in astrophysics, used to probe distant galaxies, intergalactic medium, and the early universe. However, because Earth's atmosphere absorbs UV radiation, these lines must be observed from space-based telescopes.

Find the wavelength of the third line in the Lyman series, and identify the type of EM radiation.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The Lyman series corresponds to transitions ending at the ground state, so $$ n_{\text{f}} = 1 $$ . The first line in the series corresponds to a transition from $$ n_i = 2 $$ to $$ n_f = 1 $$ , the second line from $$ n_i = 3 $$ to $$ n_f = 1 $$ , and the third line from $$ n_i = 4 $$ to $$ n_f = 1 $$ . We'll use the Rydberg formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{f}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
</div>

where $$ R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$ is the Rydberg constant.

**Solution**

For the third line in the Lyman series, we have $$ n_{\text{f}} = 1 $$ and $$ n_i = 4 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{16} \right) = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{15}{16} \right) $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.028 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{1}{1.028 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 9.72 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m} = 97.2 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

This wavelength of 97.2 nm is in the **ultraviolet (UV)** region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Discussion**

The entire Lyman series lies in the UV region, which makes sense because these transitions all end at the ground state (n = 1), which means they involve relatively large energy changes. As we move to higher lines in the series (from the first to the second to the third, etc.), the wavelength increases (the photon energy decreases) because the energy difference between successive levels decreases. The third line at 97.2 nm is still well into the UV (UV extends from about 10 nm to 400 nm), though it's longer than the first line (121 nm) and second line (103 nm). The series limit (as $$ n_i \to \infty $$ ) approaches 91.2 nm, which represents the minimum energy needed to ionize hydrogen from its ground state.

Look up the values of the quantities in  $${a}_{\text{B}}=\frac{ h^{2} }{ 4\pi^{2}{m}_{e} k q_{e}^{2} } $$ ,
 and verify that the Bohr radius  $${a}_{\text{B}} $$
 is  $$ 0.529 \times 10^{-10}  \text{m} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll substitute the known values of fundamental constants into the equation $$ a_{\text{B}} = \frac{h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e k q_e^2} $$ and verify that the result is $$ 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ . The constants we need are:
- Planck's constant: $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$
- Electron mass: $$ m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} $$
- Coulomb's constant: $$ k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 $$
- Elementary charge: $$ q_e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} $$

**Solution**

Substituting these values into the Bohr radius equation:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{B}} = \frac{h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e k q_e^2} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2}{4\pi^2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(8.988 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})^2} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{B}} = \frac{4.390 \times 10^{-67} \text{ J}^2\text{·s}^2}{(39.478)(9.109 \times 10^{-31})(8.988 \times 10^9)(2.566 \times 10^{-38})} \text{ kg·N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\text{·C}^2 $$

<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{B}} = \frac{4.390 \times 10^{-67}}{8.298 \times 10^{-57}} \text{ m} = 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} = 5.29 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m} $$
</div>

This verifies that the Bohr radius is **$$ 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ or 0.529 Å** (angstroms).

**Discussion**

The Bohr radius represents the most probable distance of the electron from the nucleus in the ground state of the hydrogen atom. This fundamental length scale emerges naturally from the combination of quantum mechanics (Planck's constant $$ h $$ ), the properties of the electron (its mass $$ m_e $$ and charge $$ q_e $$ ), and the electromagnetic force (Coulomb's constant $$ k $$ ). The fact that this theoretical prediction matches experimental measurements of the hydrogen atom's size was one of the great triumphs of Bohr's theory. The Bohr radius serves as a natural unit for expressing atomic distances—for example, in hydrogen-like atoms, the radius of the n-th orbit is $$ r_n = n^2 a_{\text{B}}/Z $$ . The small value (about 0.05 nm or half an angstrom) explains why atoms are invisible to the naked eye and why we need powerful microscopes or indirect methods to study atomic structure. It's worth noting that in modern quantum mechanics, we no longer think of the electron as orbiting at a fixed radius; instead, the Bohr radius represents the peak of the radial probability distribution for finding the electron in the ground state.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll substitute the known fundamental constants into the given equation and calculate the result. The constants we need are:
- Electron charge: $$ q_e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} $$
- Electron mass: $$ m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} $$

- Planck's constant: $$ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s} $$

**Solution**

Substituting these values into the equation:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_0 = \frac{2\pi^2 q_e^4 m_e k^2}{h^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_0 = \frac{2\pi^2 (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})^4 (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}) (8.988 \times 10^9 \text{ N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)^2}{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2} $$

$$ E_0 = \frac{2(9.870)(6.595 \times 10^{-76})(9.109 \times 10^{-31})(8.079 \times 10^{19})}{4.390 \times 10^{-67}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_0 = \frac{9.521 \times 10^{-86}}{4.390 \times 10^{-67}} = 2.169 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J} $$
</div>

Converting to electron volts (dividing by $$ q_e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} $$ ):

<div class="equation">
$$ E_0 = \frac{2.169 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} = 13.6 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

This verifies that the ground state energy of hydrogen is indeed **13.6 eV**.

**Discussion**

This result is fundamental to atomic physics. The ground state energy of –13.6 eV (negative because it represents a bound state) means that 13.6 eV of energy is required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state. This value emerges directly from the fundamental constants of nature—the electron's charge and mass, Planck's constant, and Coulomb's constant. The fact that Bohr could derive this experimentally known value from first principles was a major triumph of his theory and provided strong support for the quantum model of the atom. The energy levels for excited states are given by $$ E_n = E_0/n^2 $$ , so all hydrogen energy levels can be calculated from this single fundamental value.

If a hydrogen atom has its electron in the  $$n=4 $$
 state, how much energy in eV is needed to ionize it?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy of an electron in the n-th energy level of hydrogen is given by $$ E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} $$ . To ionize the atom from the $$ n = 4 $$ state means bringing the electron from $$ E_4 $$ to zero energy (the ionization threshold). The ionization energy is the magnitude of $$ E_4 $$ .

**Solution**

For $$ n = 4 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ E_4 = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{4^2} = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{16} = -0.850 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The ionization energy is:

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Ionization energy} = 0 - E_4 = 0 - (-0.850 \text{ eV}) = 0.850 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Therefore, **0.850 eV** of energy is needed to ionize a hydrogen atom from the $$ n = 4 $$ state.

**Discussion**

This energy is much less than the 13.6 eV needed to ionize hydrogen from its ground state ( $$ n = 1 $$ ). The higher the energy level, the less tightly the electron is bound to the nucleus, and therefore the less energy is required to ionize it. This makes physical sense because the electron in the $$ n = 4 $$ state is farther from the nucleus (the orbital radius increases as $$ n^2 $$ ) and experiences a weaker attractive force. The ionization energy decreases as $$ 1/n^2 $$ : for $$ n = 2 $$ it's 3.4 eV, for $$ n = 3 $$ it's 1.51 eV, and for $$ n = 4 $$ it's 0.850 eV. As $$ n \to \infty $$ , the ionization energy approaches zero, meaning the electron is barely bound. This is why highly excited atoms (high $$ n $$ ) are easily ionized by collisions, electric fields, or photons, and why such "Rydberg atoms" are important in studying quantum-to-classical transitions and in applications like quantum computing.

A hydrogen atom in an excited state can be ionized with less energy than when it is in its ground state. What is  $$n $$  for a hydrogen atom if 0.850 eV of energy can ionize it?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy of an electron in the $$ n $$-th energy level of hydrogen is given by $$ E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} $$ . The energy is negative because the electron is in a bound state. To ionize the atom from level $$ n $$ , we must provide enough energy to bring the electron from $$ E_n $$ to zero energy (the ionization threshold). Therefore, the ionization energy is $$ |E_n| = \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} $$ . We can solve for $$ n $$ .

**Solution**

Setting the ionization energy equal to 0.850 eV:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2} = 0.850 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Solving for $$ n^2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ n^2 = \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{0.850 \text{ eV}} = 16.0 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ n = \sqrt{16.0} = 4 $$
</div>

Therefore, the hydrogen atom is in the **n = 4** energy level.

**Discussion**

This result makes physical sense. The higher the energy level (larger $$ n $$ ), the less tightly bound the electron is to the nucleus, and therefore the less energy is required to ionize it. For the ground state (n = 1), we need 13.6 eV to ionize hydrogen. For n = 2, we need 13.6/4 = 3.4 eV. For n = 3, we need 13.6/9 = 1.51 eV. And for n = 4, we need 13.6/16 = 0.850 eV, which matches the given ionization energy. As $$ n $$ approaches infinity, the ionization energy approaches zero, which makes sense because the electron is already nearly free at very high quantum numbers. This problem demonstrates why excited atoms are more easily ionized than ground-state atoms—a fact that's important in understanding phenomena like flame tests, gas discharge tubes, and ionized gases in stars.

Find the radius of a hydrogen atom in the  $$n=2 $$
 state according to Bohr’s theory.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

According to Bohr's theory, the radius of the n-th orbit in hydrogen is given by $$ r_n = n^2 a_{\text{B}} $$ , where $$ a_{\text{B}} = 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ is the Bohr radius. For the $$ n = 2 $$ state, we simply substitute $$ n = 2 $$ into this formula.

**Solution**

Using $$ r_n = n^2 a_{\text{B}} $$ with $$ n = 2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ r_2 = (2)^2 a_{\text{B}} = 4 \times (0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}) = 2.12 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$
</div>

The radius of the $$ n = 2 $$ state is **$$ 2.12 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ or 2.12 Å**.

**Discussion**

The $$ n = 2 $$ state has a radius exactly 4 times larger than the ground state ( $$ n = 1 $$ ), demonstrating the $$ n^2 $$ scaling of orbital radius in Bohr's model. This is the first excited state of hydrogen. When an atom transitions from $$ n = 2 $$ to $$ n = 1 $$ , it emits a photon at 121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha), the first line of the Lyman series. In modern quantum mechanics, we interpret this radius as the location of the peak in the radial probability distribution for the 2s orbital, or the average radius for 2p orbitals. The larger radius of excited states explains why excited atoms are physically bigger and more easily perturbed by external fields than ground-state atoms. The $$ n^2 $$ scaling also explains why very high-n "Rydberg atoms" can be macroscopically large—for example, atoms with $$ n = 100 $$ would have radii of about 0.5 micrometers, large enough to be affected by room-temperature thermal radiation.

Show that  $$\left(13.6 \text{eV}\right)/hc= 1.097 \times 10^{7}  \text{m}=R $$
 (Rydberg's constant), as discussed in the text.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We need to calculate $$ \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{hc} $$ and show it equals the Rydberg constant $$ R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$ . We'll use the convenient relationship $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ to simplify the calculation.

**Solution**

Using the relationship $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{hc} = \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{1240 \text{ eV·nm}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ = \frac{13.6}{1240} \text{ nm}^{-1} = 0.01097 \text{ nm}^{-1} $$
</div>

Converting to m⁻¹ (since 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m, so 1 nm⁻¹ = 10⁹ m⁻¹):

<div class="equation">
$$ = 0.01097 \times 10^9 \text{ m}^{-1} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$
</div>

This is exactly equal to the Rydberg constant $$ R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$ .

**Discussion**

This result beautifully demonstrates the connection between Bohr's atomic theory and the empirically discovered Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant, originally determined from experimental spectroscopic data, can now be understood as arising from the fundamental ground-state binding energy of hydrogen (13.6 eV) divided by $$ hc $$ . This relationship appears in the formula for the wavelengths of spectral lines:

$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$

The fact that Bohr's theory could not only explain the existence of discrete spectral lines but also derive the previously mysterious Rydberg constant from first principles was one of the theory's greatest triumphs. It showed that quantum mechanics could make precise quantitative predictions, not just qualitative explanations, and established the validity of the quantum approach to atomic structure.

What is the smallest-wavelength line in the Balmer series? Is it in the visible part of the spectrum?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at $$ n_f = 2 $$ . The smallest wavelength (highest energy) occurs when the initial state has the highest possible $$ n_i $$ , which approaches infinity. We'll use the Rydberg formula with $$ n_f = 2 $$ and $$ n_i \to \infty $$ to find the series limit.

**Solution**

Using the Rydberg formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
</div>

For the series limit, $$ n_f = 2 $$ and $$ n_i \to \infty $$ , so $$ \frac{1}{n_i^2} \to 0 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} = R \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - 0 \right) = \frac{R}{4} = \frac{1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}}{4} = 2.743 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{1}{2.743 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 3.65 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 365 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

The smallest wavelength in the Balmer series is **365 nm**, which is in the **ultraviolet** region (just below the 400 nm threshold for visible light).

**Discussion**

The Balmer series limit at 365 nm represents the minimum energy photon that can ionize a hydrogen atom from the $$ n = 2 $$ state. All transitions in the Balmer series that we observe have wavelengths longer than 365 nm. The first four lines of the Balmer series are in the visible region (H-alpha at 656 nm is red, H-beta at 486 nm is blue-green, H-gamma at 434 nm is violet, and H-delta at 410 nm is deep violet), but as we move to higher transitions (higher initial $$ n $$ values), the wavelengths get shorter and eventually cross into the UV at 365 nm. This series limit is important historically—Balmer discovered the empirical formula for hydrogen spectral lines by studying these visible lines, and his work laid the foundation for Bohr's quantum theory of the atom. The fact that the series has a well-defined limit (rather than continuing indefinitely) was one of the key clues that atomic energy levels are quantized.

Show that the entire Paschen series is in the infrared part of the spectrum. To do this, you only need to calculate the shortest wavelength in the series.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The Paschen series corresponds to transitions that end at $$ n_{\text{f}} = 3 $$ . The shortest wavelength (highest energy transition) in any series occurs when $$ n_i \to \infty $$ , because this represents the largest possible energy difference for that series. If we can show that even this shortest wavelength is in the infrared (λ > 700 nm), then all other lines in the Paschen series must also be in the infrared, since they have longer wavelengths. We'll use the Rydberg formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{f}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
</div>

**Solution**

For the Paschen series, $$ n_{\text{f}} = 3 $$ . As $$ n_i \to \infty $$ , the term $$ \frac{1}{n_i^2} \to 0 $$ , so:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} = R \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - 0 \right) = \frac{R}{9} $$
</div>

Substituting $$ R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{min}}} = \frac{1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}}{9} = 1.219 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1} $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{1}{1.219 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1}} = 8.20 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 820 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

Since the infrared region begins at wavelengths greater than about 700 nm, and the shortest wavelength in the Paschen series is 820 nm, the entire Paschen series lies in the infrared region.

**Discussion**

This result demonstrates why the Paschen series was discovered later than the Balmer series—it's not visible to the human eye. The visible spectrum extends from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), while infrared radiation has wavelengths longer than 700 nm. Since 820 nm is the *shortest* wavelength in the Paschen series, all other lines in the series (corresponding to transitions from $$ n_i = 4, 5, 6, ... $$ to $$ n_f = 3 $$ ) must have even longer wavelengths and therefore are also in the infrared. For example, the first line of the Paschen series (from $$ n_i = 4 $$ to $$ n_f = 3 $$ ) has a wavelength of 1875 nm, which is well into the infrared. This series is important in astronomy for studying stellar atmospheres and in understanding the complete hydrogen spectrum.

Do the Balmer and Lyman series overlap? To answer this, calculate the shortest-wavelength Balmer line and the longest-wavelength Lyman line.

To determine if the Balmer and Lyman series overlap, we need to compare the shortest wavelength of the Balmer series (its series limit) with the longest wavelength of the Lyman series (its first line).

</div>

Since **365 nm > 122 nm**, the Balmer and Lyman series **do not overlap**.

**Discussion**

The Balmer series spans from 365 nm (series limit) to 656 nm (H-alpha line), while the Lyman series spans from 91.2 nm (series limit) to 122 nm (Lyman-alpha). There's a clear gap of 243 nm (from 122 nm to 365 nm) between these two series. This gap is significant—it's nearly twice the width of the Lyman series itself. This separation makes sense because the Balmer series involves transitions to $$ n = 2 $$ while Lyman involves transitions to $$ n = 1 $$ , and the energy difference between these final states is substantial (10.2 eV). The non-overlapping nature of hydrogen's spectral series made it easier for early spectroscopists to identify and categorize the different series. In contrast, for heavier hydrogen-like ions with larger $$ Z $$ values, the energy levels scale as $$ Z^2 $$ , which can cause different series to overlap in wavelength even though they correspond to different transitions.

**Strategy**

The Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at $$ n_{\text{f}} = 2 $$ , with initial states $$ n_i = 3, 4, 5, 6, ... $$ . The visible spectrum extends from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), while ultraviolet (UV) radiation has wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. We'll calculate the wavelength for each Balmer line using the Rydberg formula until we find the transition into the UV region. Since wavelength decreases as $$ n_i $$ increases, we need to find which value of $$ n_i $$ produces the first wavelength below 400 nm.

$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right) = \left(1.097 \times 10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}\right) \left( \frac{5}{36} \right) = 1.524 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1} $$

**(a)** The line corresponding to the transition from $$ n_i = 7 $$ to $$ n_f = 2 $$ (H-epsilon line) is the first one in the UV part of the spectrum, with $$ \lambda = 397 \text{ nm} $$ .

**(b)** Four Balmer series lines are in the visible part of the spectrum (corresponding to $$ n_i = 3, 4, 5, 6 $$ ).

**(c)** Infinitely many Balmer lines are in the UV. As $$ n_i $$ increases from 7 to infinity, all wavelengths become progressively shorter, remaining in the UV and approaching the series limit of 365 nm.

**Discussion**

The Balmer series is special because it's the only hydrogen spectral series with lines in the visible region—this is why it was discovered first and studied most extensively in early spectroscopy. The four visible lines (H-alpha at 656 nm appearing red, H-beta at 486 nm appearing blue-green, H-gamma at 434 nm appearing violet, and H-delta at 410 nm appearing violet) can be seen with the naked eye in hydrogen discharge tubes and in astronomical observations of nebulae and stars. The fact that only four lines are visible while infinitely many are in the UV illustrates how the energy levels become more closely spaced as $$ n $$ increases. The series limit (as $$ n_i \to \infty $$ ) is at 365 nm, representing the energy needed to ionize hydrogen from the $$ n = 2 $$ state. This wavelength marks the shortest possible Balmer line and separates discrete spectral lines from the continuum that appears beyond the series limit.

**Strategy**

We're given the wavelength $$ \lambda = 4.653 \text{ μm} $$ and the final level $$ n_f = 5 $$ . We need to find the initial level $$ n_i $$ . Using the Rydberg formula, we can solve for $$ n_i $$ : $$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$ .

**Solution**

First, convert the wavelength to meters:

Using the Rydberg formula:

The electron was initially in the **n = 7** level.

**Discussion**

This transition from $$ n = 7 $$ to $$ n = 5 $$ produces infrared radiation at 4.653 μm, which is well beyond the visible range. This is part of what we might call an extended Pfund series (transitions ending at $$ n = 5 $$ ). The Pfund series includes several lines in the mid-infrared, all invisible to the human eye but detectable with infrared spectrometers. The long wavelength (low energy) of this transition makes sense because both initial and final states are highly excited, so the energy difference is relatively small. Transitions between high-lying states are important in astrophysics for studying the conditions in stellar atmospheres and interstellar gas clouds, where hydrogen atoms can be excited to these high levels by the intense radiation fields. These infrared hydrogen lines are also used to study the kinematics of gas in galaxies through Doppler shifts.

A singly ionized helium ion has only one electron and is denoted  $${\text{He}}^{+} $$ .
 What is the ion's radius in the ground state compared to the Bohr radius of hydrogen atom?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

A singly ionized helium ion ( $$\text{He}^+$$ ) is a hydrogen-like atom with one electron orbiting a nucleus containing two protons (so $$ Z = 2 $$ ). We can use the general formula for the radius of hydrogen-like atoms:

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2}{Z} a_{\text{B}} $$
</div>

where $$ a_{\text{B}} = 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$ is the Bohr radius. For the ground state, $$ n = 1 $$ .

**Solution**

For $$\text{He}^+$$ in the ground state, we have $$ n = 1 $$ and $$ Z = 2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ r_1 = \frac{1^2}{2} a_{\text{B}} = \frac{a_{\text{B}}}{2} = 0.5 \, a_{\text{B}} $$
</div>

Therefore, the radius of $$\text{He}^+$$ in its ground state is **half the Bohr radius** of hydrogen, or:

<div class="equation">
$$ r_1 = 0.5 \times (0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}) = 0.265 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} = 0.265 \text{ Å} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This result makes physical sense: the helium nucleus has twice the positive charge of the hydrogen nucleus, so it exerts a stronger attractive force on the electron. This stronger force pulls the electron into a tighter orbit, reducing the orbital radius by a factor of 2. More generally, for any hydrogen-like ion in the ground state, the radius is inversely proportional to the atomic number: $$ r_1 = a_{\text{B}}/Z $$ . This means that highly ionized atoms (large $$ Z $$ ) have very small radii. For example, $$\text{Li}^{2+}$$ (lithium with two electrons removed, $$ Z = 3 $$ ) would have a ground-state radius of $$ a_{\text{B}}/3 $$ . The same principle applies to energy levels: the binding energy of $$\text{He}^+$$ is proportional to $$ Z^2 = 4 $$ , making it four times more tightly bound than hydrogen (54.4 eV compared to 13.6 eV for hydrogen).

A beryllium ion with a single electron (denoted  $${\text{Be}}^{3+} $$ )

(a) What is $$n $$ for the $${\text{Be}}^{3+} $$ ion?

(b) How much energy in eV is needed to ionize the ion from this excited state?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

For hydrogen-like ions (single electron), the orbital radius is given by $$ r_n = \frac{n^2}{Z} a_{\text{B}} $$ and the energy is $$ E_n = -\frac{Z^2}{n^2}(13.6 \text{ eV}) $$ , where $$ Z $$ is the atomic number. For Be³⁺, $$ Z = 4 $$ . (a) We'll find which $$ n $$ gives the same radius as hydrogen's ground state ( $$ r = a_{\text{B}} $$ ). (b) We'll calculate the ionization energy from that state.

**Solution**

(a) The ground state of hydrogen has radius $$ r_1 = a_{\text{B}} $$ . For Be³⁺ with $$ Z = 4 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2}{Z} a_{\text{B}} = \frac{n^2}{4} a_{\text{B}} $$
</div>

Setting this equal to $$ a_{\text{B}} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{n^2}{4} a_{\text{B}} = a_{\text{B}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ n^2 = 4 $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ n = 2 $$
</div>

The Be³⁺ ion is in the **n = 2** state.

(b) The energy of the $$ n = 2 $$ state for Be³⁺ is:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_2 = -\frac{Z^2}{n^2}(13.6 \text{ eV}) = -\frac{(4)^2}{(2)^2}(13.6 \text{ eV}) = -\frac{16}{4}(13.6 \text{ eV}) = -4 \times 13.6 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ E_2 = -54.4 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The ionization energy is the energy needed to bring the electron from $$ E_2 = -54.4 \text{ eV} $$ to $$ E = 0 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Ionization energy} = 0 - (-54.4 \text{ eV}) = 54.4 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

The ionization energy is **54.4 eV**.

**Discussion**

This problem beautifully illustrates how the $$ Z^2 $$ scaling affects both orbital radii and energies in hydrogen-like ions. The Be³⁺ ion has $$ Z = 4 $$ , so its orbitals are compressed by a factor of $$ Z = 4 $$ (radius scales as $$ 1/Z $$ ) compared to hydrogen at the same $$ n $$ . To match hydrogen's ground state radius, the Be³⁺ electron must be in $$ n = 2 $$ , which is its first excited state. However, despite having the same radius as hydrogen's ground state, the Be³⁺ ion in $$ n = 2 $$ is much more tightly bound—it requires 54.4 eV to ionize, exactly 4 times the 13.6 eV needed for hydrogen's ground state (energy scales as $$ Z^2 $$ ). This shows that nuclear charge dominates the binding energy. Be³⁺ is created in very hot environments like stellar interiors or in high-energy laboratory plasmas. The high ionization energy of 54.4 eV (even from an excited state!) means that only very energetic photons (in the soft X-ray region, around 23 nm wavelength) or very energetic collisions can ionize it. For comparison, the ground state ($$ n = 1 $$ ) of Be³⁺ would require 217.6 eV to ionize, placing it in the extreme UV to soft X-ray spectral region.

 a carbon atom with only a single electron.

those of hydrogen?

(b) What is the wavelength of the first line in this ion's Paschen series?

(c) What type of EM radiation is this?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The ion $$\text{C}^{+5}$$ is a carbon atom with 5 electrons removed, leaving only one electron. Since carbon has 6 protons, $$ Z = 6 $$ for this hydrogen-like ion. For hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are given by:

<div class="equation">
$$ E_n = -\frac{Z^2}{n^2} E_0 $$
</div>

where $$ E_0 = 13.6 \text{ eV} $$ is the ground-state energy of hydrogen. The energy of a photon emitted during a transition is $$ \Delta E = E_i - E_f $$ , which can be related to wavelength using $$ E = hc/\lambda $$ .

**Solution**

**(a)** The energy levels of $$\text{C}^{+5}$$ are greater than those of hydrogen by a factor of $$ Z^2 $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \text{Factor} = Z^2 = 6^2 = 36 $$

The energies are **36 times greater** than those of hydrogen.

</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = (36)(13.6 \text{ eV}) \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) = (489.6 \text{ eV}) \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{16} \right) $$

<div class="equation">
$$ \Delta E = (489.6 \text{ eV}) \left( \frac{16 - 9}{144} \right) = (489.6 \text{ eV}) \left( \frac{7}{144} \right) = 23.8 \text{ eV} $$
</div>

Converting to wavelength using $$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} $$ and $$ hc = 1240 \text{ eV·nm} $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ \lambda = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{23.8 \text{ eV}} = 52.1 \text{ nm} $$
</div>

**(c)** A wavelength of 52.1 nm is in the **ultraviolet (UV)** region of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or far-UV range.

**Discussion**

This problem illustrates how hydrogen-like ions with high atomic numbers produce much higher energy transitions than hydrogen itself. The factor of 36 increase in energy (due to $$ Z^2 = 36 $$ ) means that what would be an infrared transition in hydrogen (the Paschen series) becomes an extreme ultraviolet transition in $$\text{C}^{+5}$$ . For comparison, the first line of the Paschen series in hydrogen has a wavelength of 1875 nm (infrared), while the same transition in $$\text{C}^{+5}$$ has a wavelength 36 times shorter: 52.1 nm (extreme UV). This is exactly what we expect since $$ \lambda \propto 1/(\Delta E) \propto 1/Z^2 $$ . Such highly ionized carbon atoms are found in the solar corona and other high-temperature astrophysical plasmas where temperatures exceed one million Kelvin. The extreme UV radiation from these ions is important for understanding solar physics and space weather, though it is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere and must be observed from space-based telescopes.

 using the approach stated in the text. That is, equate the Coulomb and centripetal forces and then insert an expression for velocity from the condition for angular momentum quantization.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

We'll follow Bohr's approach by: (1) equating the electrostatic Coulomb force to the centripetal force needed to keep the electron in circular orbit, and (2) using the quantization condition for angular momentum $$ L = m_e v r_n = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$ to eliminate the velocity. This will yield expressions for $$ r_n $$ in terms of fundamental constants and quantum number $$ n $$ .

**Solution**

Starting with the force balance equation, the Coulomb attractive force equals the centripetal force:

<div class="equation">
$$ \frac{kZq_e^2}{r_n^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r_n} $$
</div>

Multiplying both sides by $$ r_n $$ and rearranging:

<div class="equation">
$$ kZq_e^2 = m_e v^2 r_n $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{kZq_e^2}{m_e v^2} $$
</div>

From Bohr's quantization condition:

<div class="equation">
$$ m_e v r_n = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$
</div>

Solving for $$ v $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ v = \frac{nh}{2\pi m_e r_n} $$
</div>

Substituting this expression for $$ v $$ into our equation for $$ r_n $$ :

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{kZq_e^2}{m_e} \cdot \frac{1}{v^2} = \frac{kZq_e^2}{m_e} \cdot \frac{4\pi^2 m_e^2 r_n^2}{n^2 h^2} $$
</div>

Simplifying:

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{kZq_e^2 \cdot 4\pi^2 m_e r_n^2}{m_e n^2 h^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ 1 = \frac{kZq_e^2 \cdot 4\pi^2 m_e r_n}{n^2 h^2} $$
</div>

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e k Z q_e^2} = \frac{n^2}{Z} \cdot \frac{h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e k q_e^2} $$
</div>

Defining the Bohr radius as:

<div class="equation">
$$ a_{\text{B}} = \frac{h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e k q_e^2} = 0.529 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m} $$
</div>

We obtain the general formula:

<div class="equation">
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2}{Z} a_{\text{B}} $$
</div>

This verifies both equations.

**Discussion**

This derivation is at the heart of Bohr's atomic model and represents a brilliant synthesis of classical and quantum ideas. The force balance equation (Coulomb force = centripetal force) is pure classical mechanics, while the quantization condition $$ L = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$ introduces quantum mechanics. The resulting formula $$ r_n = \frac{n^2}{Z} a_{\text{B}} $$ has profound implications: (1) Orbital radii are quantized and scale as $$ n^2 $$ , explaining why higher energy states are much larger; (2) For hydrogen-like ions, the radius scales as $$ 1/Z $$ , meaning higher nuclear charge squeezes the electron orbits inward; (3) The Bohr radius $$ a_{\text{B}} $$ emerges as a natural length scale built from fundamental constants, representing the ground state size of hydrogen. At the time (1913), this theory successfully explained the Rydberg formula for hydrogen spectral lines and predicted the radii of excited states. Although superseded by full quantum mechanics, Bohr's model remains pedagogically valuable and gives surprisingly accurate results for hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions. The approach also introduced the revolutionary idea that quantum numbers (like $$ n $$ ) determine discrete atomic properties—a concept that became central to all of quantum physics.

The average percentage difference is approximately **0.03%** or about **0.3 parts per thousand**.

**Discussion**

This remarkably small average percentage difference (only about 0.03%) demonstrates the extraordinary accuracy of the Rydberg formula in predicting hydrogen spectral lines. The fact that such a simple empirical formula—originally developed by Balmer and Rydberg before the development of quantum mechanics—could predict wavelengths to within a few hundredths of a percent is truly remarkable. This agreement provided strong evidence that there was a fundamental physical principle underlying atomic spectra, even before Bohr developed his quantum theory of the hydrogen atom. The small discrepancies that do exist (all less than 0.05%) can be attributed to several factors: experimental uncertainties in measuring wavelengths, the finite mass of the nucleus (which we assumed to be infinite in the simple Bohr model), and relativistic corrections for the electron's motion. When Bohr showed that his quantum theory could derive the Rydberg formula from first principles and explain *why* it worked so well, it was a watershed moment in physics that validated the quantum approach to atomic structure.
