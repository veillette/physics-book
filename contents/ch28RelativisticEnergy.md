A tokamak is a form of experimental fusion reactor, which can change mass to
energy. Accomplishing this requires an understanding of relativistic energy.
Nuclear reactors are proof of the conservation of relativistic energy.

Conservation of energy is one of the most important laws in physics. Not only
does energy have many important forms, but each form can be converted to any
other. We know that classically the total amount of energy in a system remains
constant. Relativistically, energy is still conserved, provided its definition
is altered to include the possibility of mass changing to energy, as in the
reactions that occur within a nuclear reactor. Relativistic energy is
intentionally defined so that it will be conserved in all inertial frames, just
as is the case for relativistic momentum. As a consequence, we learn that
several fundamental quantities are related in ways not known in classical
physics. All of these relationships are verified by experiment and have
fundamental consequences. The altered definition of energy contains some of the
most fundamental and spectacular new insights into nature found in recent
history.

### Total Energy and Rest Energy

The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same
in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy
is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor.

Total Energy
</div>
<strong class="term" >Total energy </strong> $$E $$
 is defined to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\gamma mc^{2}, $$
</div>
where  $$m $$  is mass,  $$c $$
 is the speed of light,  $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}} $$ ,
 and  $$v $$
 is the velocity of the mass relative to an observer. There are many aspects of the total energy  $$E $$
 that we will discuss—among them are how kinetic and potential energies are included in  $$E $$ ,
 and how  $$E $$
 is related to relativistic momentum. But first, note that at rest, total energy is not zero. Rather, when  $$v=0 $$ ,
 we have  $$\gamma =1 $$ ,  and an object has rest energy.

Rest Energy
</div>
**Rest energy** is

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}_{0}=mc^{2}. $$
</div>
</div>

This is the correct form of Einstein’s most famous equation, which for the first
time showed that energy is related to the mass of an object at rest. For
example, if energy is stored in the object, its rest mass increases. This also
implies that mass can be destroyed to release energy. The implications of these
first two equations regarding relativistic energy are so broad that they were
not completely recognized for some years after Einstein published them in 1907,
nor was the experimental proof that they are correct widely recognized at first.
Einstein, it should be noted, did understand and describe the meanings and
implications of his theory.

Calculating Rest Energy: Rest Energy is Very Large
</div>
Calculate the rest energy of a 1.00-g mass.

**Strategy**

One gram is a small mass—less than half the mass of a penny. We can multiply
this mass, in SI units, by the speed of light squared to find the equivalent
rest energy.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns. $$m= 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{kg} $$ ; $$c= 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ 2. Identify the unknown. $${E}_{0} $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $${E}_{0}=mc^{2} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
$$\begin{array}{lll}{E}_{0}& =& mc^{2}=\left( 1.00 \times 10^{-3} $$
   \text{kg}\right) { \left( 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}\\ & =&
   9.00 \times 10^{13} \text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}\end{array}
$$ $$
   </div>

5. Convert units. Noting that $$1 \text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}=1 \text{J} $$ , we see the rest mass energy is

    <div class="equation" >
     $${E}_{0}= 9.00 \times 10^{13}  \text{J}. $$
    </div>

**Discussion**

This is an enormous amount of energy for a 1.00-g mass. We do not notice this
energy, because it is generally not available. Rest energy is large because the
speed of light $$c $$ is a large number and $${c}^{2} $$ is a very large number,
so that $$mc^{2} $$ is huge for any macroscopic mass. The $$ 9.00 \times 10^{13} \text{J} $$ rest mass energy for 1.00 g is about twice the energy released by
the Hiroshima atomic bomb and about 10 000 times the kinetic energy of a large
aircraft carrier. If a way can be found to convert rest mass energy into some
other form (and all forms of energy can be converted into one another), then
huge amounts of energy can be obtained from the destruction of mass.

</div>

Today, the practical applications of **the conversion of mass into another form
of energy**, such as in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants, are well
known. But examples also existed when Einstein first proposed the correct form
of relativistic energy, and he did describe some of them. Nuclear radiation had
been discovered in the previous decade, and it had been a mystery as to where
its energy originated. The explanation was that, in certain nuclear processes, a
small amount of mass is destroyed and energy is released and carried by nuclear
radiation. But the amount of mass destroyed is so small that it is difficult to
detect that any is missing. Although Einstein proposed this as the source of
energy in the radioactive salts then being studied, it was many years before
there was broad recognition that mass could be and, in fact, commonly is
converted to energy. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

![Part a of the figure shows a solar storm on the Sun. Part b of the figure shows the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, which produces electricity by nuclear fission.](../resources/Figure_28_06_02.jpg 'The Sun (a) and the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (b) both convert mass into energy—the Sun via nuclear fusion, the electric station via nuclear fission. (credits: (a) NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Scientific Visualization Studio; (b) U.S. government) ')
{: #Figure2}

Because of the relationship of rest energy to mass, we now consider mass to be a
form of energy rather than something separate. There had not even been a hint of
this prior to Einstein’s work. Such conversion is now known to be the source of
the Sun’s energy, the energy of nuclear decay, and even the source of energy
keeping Earth’s interior hot.

### Stored Energy and Potential Energy

What happens to energy stored in an object at rest, such as the energy put into
a battery by charging it, or the energy stored in a toy gun’s compressed spring?
The energy input becomes part of the total energy of the object and, thus,
increases its rest mass. All stored and potential energy becomes mass in a
system. Why is it we don’t ordinarily notice this? In fact, conservation of
mass (meaning total mass is constant) was one of the great laws verified by
19th-century science. Why was it not noticed to be incorrect? The following
example helps answer these questions.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Rest Mass: A Small Mass Increase due to Energy Input
</div>
A car battery is rated to be able to move 600 ampere-hours  $$\left(A·h\right) $$
 of charge at 12.0 V. (a) Calculate the increase in rest mass of such a battery when it is taken from being fully depleted to being fully charged. (b) What percent increase is this, given the battery’s mass is 20.0 kg?

**Strategy**

In part (a), we first must find the energy stored in the battery, which equals
what the battery can supply in the form of electrical potential energy. Since
$${\text{PE}}_{\text{elec}}=qV $$ , we have to calculate the charge $$q $$ in
$$600 A·h $$ , which is the product of the current $$I $$ and the time $$t $$ .
We then multiply the result by 12.0 V. We can then calculate the battery’s
increase in mass using $$\Delta E={\text{PE}}_{\text{elec}}=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2} $$ . Part (b) is a simple ratio converted to a percentage.

<strong>Solution for (a) </strong>

1. Identify the knowns. $$I\cdot t=600 \text{A}\cdot \text{h} $$ ; $$V= 12.0 \text{V} $$ ; $$c= 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ 2. Identify the unknown. $$\Delta m $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $${\text{PE}}_{\text{elec}}=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2} $$ 4. Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown. $$\Delta m=\frac{ $$
   {\text{PE}}_{\text{elec}}}{ {c}^{2}} $$ 5. Plug the knowns into the equation. <div class="equation" > $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta m& =& \frac{ {\text{PE}}_{\text{elec}}}{
   {c}^{2}}\\ & =& \frac{qV}{ {c}^{2}}\\ & =& \frac{\left(It\right)V}{
   {c}^{2}}\\ & =& \frac{\left(600 \text{A}\cdot \text{h}\right)\left(12.0
   \text{V}\right)}{ {\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8} \right)}^{2}}\text{.}\end{array}
$$ $$
   </div>

   Write amperes A as coulombs per second (C/s), and convert hours to seconds.

    <div class="equation" >
$$\begin{array}{lll} $$
    \Delta m& =& \frac{600 \text{C/s}\cdot \text{h} \left( \frac{3600 \text{s}}{1 \text{h}} \right) \left(12.0 \text{J/C}\right) }
    { { \left( 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}}\\ 
& =& \frac{\left( 2.16 \times 10^{6} \text{C}\right) \left(12.0 \text{J/C}\right)}{ { \left( 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}}\end{array} $$ $$
    </div>

   Using the conversion $$1 \text{kg}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}=1 \text{J} $$, we can write the mass as

   $$\Delta m= 2.88 \times 10^{-10} \text{kg}\text{.} $$

<strong>Solution for (b) </strong>

1. Identify the knowns. $$\Delta m= 2.88 \times 10^{-10} \text{kg} $$ ; $$m=20.0 \text{kg} $$
2. Identify the unknown. % change
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$ \text{\% increase}=\frac{\Delta m}{m}×100 \% $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\text{\% increase}& =& \frac{\Delta m}{m}×100 \%\\ & =& \frac{ 2.88 \times 10^{-10} \text{kg}}{20.0 \text{kg}}×100 \%\\ & =& 1.44 \times 10^{-9} \%\text{.}\end{array} $$ 
   </div>

**Discussion**

Both the actual increase in mass and the percent increase are very small, since
energy is divided by $${c}^{2} $$ , a very large number. We would have to be
able to measure the mass of the battery to a precision of a billionth of a
percent, or 1 part in $${10}^{11} $$ , to notice this increase. It is no wonder
that the mass variation is not readily observed. In fact, this change in mass is
so small that we may question how you could verify it is real. The answer is
found in nuclear processes in which the percentage of mass destroyed is large
enough to be measured. The mass of the fuel of a nuclear reactor, for example,
is measurably smaller when its energy has been used. In that case, stored energy
has been released (converted mostly to heat and electricity) and the rest mass
has decreased. This is also the case when you use the energy stored in a
battery, except that the stored energy is much greater in nuclear processes,
making the change in mass measurable in practice as well as in theory.

### Kinetic Energy and the Ultimate Speed Limit

Kinetic energy is energy of motion. Classically, kinetic energy has the familiar
expression $$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ . The relativistic expression for kinetic
energy is obtained from the work-energy theorem. This theorem states that the
net work on a system goes into kinetic energy. If our system starts from rest,
then the work-energy theorem is

<div class="equation" >
 $${W}_{\text{net}}=\text{KE}. $$
</div>

Relativistically, at rest we have rest energy $${E}_{0}=mc^{2} $$ . The work
increases this to the total energy $$E=\gamma mc^{2} $$ . Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${W}_{\text{net}}=E-{E}_{0}=\gamma mc^{2}-mc^{2}=\left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2}. $$
</div>

Relativistically, we have $${W}_{\text{net}}={\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}} $$.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Relativistic Kinetic Energy
</div>
**Relativistic kinetic energy** is

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}=\left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2}. $$
</div>
</div>

When motionless, we have $$v=0 $$ and

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}=1, $$
</div>

so that $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}=0 $$ at rest, as expected. But the expression
for relativistic kinetic energy (such as total energy and rest energy) does not
look much like the classical $$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ . To show that the classical
expression for kinetic energy is obtained at low velocities, we note that the
binomial expansion for $$\gamma $$ at low velocities gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma =1+\frac{1}{2}\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}. $$
</div>

A binomial expansion is a way of expressing an algebraic quantity as a sum of an
infinite series of terms. In some cases, as in the limit of small velocity here,
most terms are very small. Thus the expression derived for $$\gamma $$ here is
not exact, but it is a very accurate approximation. Thus, at low velocities,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\gamma -1=\frac{1}{2}\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}. $$
</div>

Entering this into the expression for relativistic kinetic energy gives

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}=\left[\frac{1}{2}\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}\right]mc^{2}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}={\text{KE}}_{\text{class}}. $$
</div>

So, in fact, relativistic kinetic energy does become the same as classical
kinetic energy when $$v \ll c $$.

It is even more interesting to investigate what happens to kinetic energy when
the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. We know that $$\gamma $$ becomes infinite as $$v $$ approaches $$c $$ , so that $$ \text{KE}\_ \text{rel} $$ also becomes infinite as the velocity approaches the speed of 
light. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) An infinite amount of work (and, hence, an
infinite amount of energy input) is required to accelerate a mass to the speed
of light.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
The Speed of Light
</div>
**No object with mass can attain the speed of light.**

</div>

So the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit for any particle having mass.
All of this is consistent with the fact that velocities less than $$c $$ always
add to less than $$c $$ . Both the relativistic form for kinetic energy and the
ultimate speed limit being $$c $$ have been confirmed in detail in numerous
experiments. No matter how much energy is put into accelerating a mass, its
velocity can only approach—not reach—the speed of light.

![In this figure a graph is shown on a coordinate system of axes. The x-axis is labeled as speed v (m/s). On the x-axis, velocity of the object is shown in terms of the speed of light starting from zero at origin to c, where c is the speed of light. The y-axis is labeled as Kinetic Energy K E (J). On the y-axis, relativistic kinetic energy is shown starting from 0 at origin to 1.0.

Also shown is ( \\text{KE}_\\text{class} ), the classical kinetic energy, which is similar to relativistic kinetic energy at low velocities. Note that much more energy is required to reach high velocities than predicted classically. ')

Comparing Kinetic Energy: Relativistic Energy Versus Classical Kinetic Energy
</div>
An electron has a velocity  $$v= 0.990c $$ .
 (a) Calculate the kinetic energy in MeV of the electron. (b) Compare this with the classical value for kinetic energy at this velocity. (The mass of an electron is  $$ 9.11 \times 10^{-31}  \text{kg} $$ .)

**Strategy**

The expression for relativistic kinetic energy is always correct, but for (a) it
must be used since the velocity is highly relativistic (close to $$c $$ ).
First, we will calculate the relativistic factor $$\gamma $$ , and then use it
to determine the relativistic kinetic energy. For (b), we will calculate the
classical kinetic energy (which would be close to the relativistic value if $$v $$ were less than a few percent of $$c $$ )
and see that it is not the same.

**Solution for (a)**

1. Identify the knowns. $$v= 0.990c $$ ; $$m= 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg} $$
2. Identify the unknown. $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}} $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}=\left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2} $$ 4. Plug the knowns into the equation. First calculate $$\gamma $$ . We will
   carry extra digits because this is an intermediate calculation.

    <div class="equation" >
     $$\begin{array}{lll}\gamma & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\\ & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {\left(  0.990\text{c} \right)}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}}\\ & =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\left(  0.990 \right)}^{2}}}\\ & =&  7.0888\end{array} $$
    </div>

   Next, we use this value to calculate the kinetic energy.

    <div class="equation" >
     $$\begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}& =& \left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2}\\ & =& \left(7.0888-1\right)\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right) { \left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s} \right)}^{2}\\ & =& 4.99 \times 10^{-13} \text{J}\end{array} $$
    </div>

5. Convert units.
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}& =& \left(4.99 \times 10^{-13} \text{J}\right)\left(\frac{1 \text{MeV}}{1.60 \times 10^{-13} \text{J}}\right)\\ & =& 3.12 \text{MeV}\end{array} $$ 
   </div>

**Solution for (b)**

1. List the knowns. $$v= 0.990c $$ ; $$m= 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg} $$
2. List the unknown. $${\text{KE}}_{\text{class}} $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $${\text{KE}}_ {\text{class}}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{class}}& =& \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\ & =& \frac{1}{2}\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right){\left(0.990 \right)}^{2}{\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} \right) }^{2}\\ & =& 4.02 \times 10^{-14} \text{J}\end{array} $$ 
   </div>

5. Convert units.
   <div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{class}}& =& 4.02 \times 10^{-14} \text{J}\left(\frac{1 \text{MeV}}{1.60 \times 10^{-13} \text{J}}\right)\\ & =& 0.251 \text{MeV}\end{array} $$ 
   </div>

**Discussion**

As might be expected, since the velocity is 99.0% of the speed of light, the
classical kinetic energy is significantly off from the correct relativistic
value. Note also that the classical value is much smaller than the relativistic
value. In fact, $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}{\text{/KE}}_{\text{class}}= 12.4 $$
here. This is some indication of how difficult it is to get a mass moving close
to the speed of light. Much more energy is required than predicted classically.
Some people interpret this extra energy as going into increasing the mass of the
system, but, as discussed in [Relativistic Momentum](../contents/ch28RelativisticMomentum), this cannot be
verified unambiguously. What is certain is that ever-increasing amounts of
energy are needed to get the velocity of a mass a little closer to that of
light. An energy of 3 MeV is a very small amount for an electron, and it can be
achieved with present-day particle accelerators. SLAC, for example, can
accelerate electrons to over $$50 \times 10^{9} \text{eV}= 50 000 \text{MeV} $$.

Is there any point in getting $$v $$ a little closer to c than 99.0% or 99.9%?
The answer is yes. We learn a great deal by doing this. The energy that goes
into a high-velocity mass can be converted to any other form, including into
entirely new masses. (See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).) Most of what we know about
the substructure of matter and the collection of exotic short-lived particles in
nature has been learned this way. Particles are accelerated to extremely
relativistic energies and made to collide with other particles, producing
totally new species of particles. Patterns in the characteristics of these
previously unknown particles hint at a basic substructure for all matter. These
particles and some of their characteristics will be covered
in [Particle Physics](../contents/ch33ParticlePhysics).

### Relativistic Energy and Momentum

We know classically that kinetic energy and momentum are related to each other,
since

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{\text{class}}=\frac{ {p}^{2}}{2m}=\frac{ {\left(mv\right)}^{2}}{2m}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}. $$
</div>

Relativistically, we can obtain a relationship between energy and momentum by
algebraically manipulating their definitions. This produces

<div class="equation" >
 $${E}^{2}={\left(pc \right)}^{2}+{\left(mc^2 \right)}^{2}, $$
</div>

where $$E $$ is the relativistic total energy and $$p $$ is the relativistic
momentum. This relationship between relativistic energy and relativistic
momentum is more complicated than the classical, but we can gain some
interesting new insights by examining it. First, total energy is related to
momentum and rest mass. At rest, momentum is zero, and the equation gives the
total energy to be the rest energy $$mc^{2} $$
(so this equation is consistent with the discussion of rest energy above).
However, as the mass is accelerated, its momentum $$p $$ increases, thus
increasing the total energy. At sufficiently high velocities, the rest energy
term $${\left(mc^{2}\right)}^{2} $$ becomes negligible compared with the
momentum term $${\left(pc \right)}^{2} $$ ; thus, $$E=pc $$ at extremely
relativistic velocities.

If we consider momentum $$p $$ to be distinct from mass, we can determine the
implications of the equation $${E}^{2}={ \left( pc \right)}^{2}+{ \left( m c^2 \right)}^{2}, $$ for a particle that has no mass. If we take $$m $$ to be zero
in this equation, then $$E=\text{pc} $$ , or $$p=E/c $$ . Massless particles
have this momentum. There are several massless particles found in nature,
including photons (these are quanta of electromagnetic radiation). Another
implication is that a massless particle must travel at speed $$c $$ and only at
speed $$c $$ . While it is beyond the scope of this text to examine the
relationship in the equation $${E}^{2}={\left( pc \right)}^{2}+{\left( mc^{2}\right)}^{2}, $$ in detail, we can see that the relationship has important
implications in special relativity.

Problem-Solving Strategies for Relativity
</div>
1.   <em> Examine the situation to determine that it is necessary to use relativity</em>. Relativistic effects are related to
     $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}} $$  , the quantitative relativistic factor. If $$\gamma  $$
    is very close to 1, then relativistic effects are small and differ very little from the usually easier classical calculations.
2.   <em> Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).</em>
3.   <em> Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).</em> Look in particular for information on relative velocity $$v $$ .
4.   <em> Make certain you understand the conceptual aspects of the problem before making any calculations.</em> Decide, for example, which observer sees time dilated or length contracted before plugging into equations. If you have thought about who sees what, who is moving with the event being observed, who sees proper time, and so on, you will find it much easier to determine if your calculation is reasonable.
5.   <em> Determine the primary type of calculation to be done to find the unknowns identified above.</em> You will find the section summary helpful in determining whether a length contraction, relativistic kinetic energy, or some other concept is involved.
6.   <em> Do not round off during the calculation.</em> As noted in the text, you must often perform your calculations to many digits to see the desired effect. You may round off at the very end of the problem, but do not use a rounded number in a subsequent calculation.
7.   <em> Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?</em> This may be more difficult for relativity, since we do not encounter it directly. But you can look for velocities greater than $$c $$ or relativistic effects that are in the wrong direction (such as a time contraction where a dilation was expected).

### Section Summary

- Relativistic energy is conserved as long as we define it to include the
  possibility of mass changing to energy.
- Total Energy is defined as:
  $$E=\gamma mc^{2} $$ , where $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}} $$ .
- Rest energy is $${E}_{0}=mc^{2} $$ , meaning that mass is a form of energy. If
  energy is stored in an object, its mass increases. Mass can be destroyed to
  release energy.
- We do not ordinarily notice the increase or decrease in mass of an object
  because the change in mass is so small for a large increase in energy.
- The relativistic work-energy theorem is $${W}_{\text{net}}=E-{E}_{0}=\gamma mc^{2}-mc^{2}=\left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2} $$ .
- Relativistically, $${W}_{\text{net}}={\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}} $$ , where
  $${\text{KE}}\_{\text{rel}} $$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.
- Relativistic kinetic energy is $${\text{KE}}_{\text{rel}}=\left(\gamma -1\right)mc^{2} $$ , where $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{ {v}^{2}}{ {c}^{2}}}} $$. At low velocities, relativistic kinetic energy reduces to 
  classical kinetic energy.
- **No object with mass can attain the speed of light** because an infinite
  amount of work and an infinite amount of energy input is required to
  accelerate a mass to the speed of light.
- The equation $${E}^{2}={\left(pc\right)}^{2}+{\left(mc^{2}\right)}^{2} $$
  relates the relativistic total energy $$E $$ and the relativistic momentum $$p $$. At extremely high velocities, the rest energy $$mc^{2} $$ becomes
  negligible, and $$E=pc $$.

What is the rest energy of an electron, given its mass is  $$ 9.11 \times 10^{-31}  \text{kg} $$ ?
 Give your answer in joules and MeV.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use Einstein's rest energy formula $$E_0 = mc^2$$ and convert from joules to MeV using $$1 \text{ MeV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-13}$$ J.

**Solution**

$$E_0 = mc^2 = (9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2$$

$$E_0 = (9.11 \times 10^{-31})(9.00 \times 10^{16}) = 8.20 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J}$$

Converting to MeV:

$$E_0 = \frac{8.20 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV}} = 0.512 \text{ MeV}$$

**Discussion**

The electron's rest energy of 0.512 MeV (or 511 keV) is one of the most important constants in physics. This value represents the minimum energy required to create an electron-positron pair from pure energy, and it's the energy released when an electron and positron annihilate. The 0.512 MeV value is so fundamental that particle physicists often use it as a unit comparison—energies much greater than 0.512 MeV indicate relativistic electrons. This rest energy is also why beta decay can occur: when a neutron decays to a proton, the 1.29 MeV mass-energy difference is more than enough to create the electron (0.512 MeV) plus kinetic energy.

Find the rest energy in joules and MeV of a proton, given its mass is  $$ 1.67 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg} $$.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Use Einstein's rest energy formula $$E_0 = mc^2$$ and convert the result from joules to MeV using the conversion factor $$1 \text{ MeV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-13}$$ J.

**Solution**

$$E_0 = mc^2 = (1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg})(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2$$

$$E_0 = (1.67 \times 10^{-27})(9.00 \times 10^{16}) = 1.503 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}$$

Converting to MeV:

$$E_0 = \frac{1.503 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV}} = 938 \text{ MeV}$$

**Discussion**

The proton's rest mass energy is approximately 938 MeV, a fundamental constant in particle physics. This is the minimum energy required to create a proton-antiproton pair from pure energy, and it represents the energy that would be released if a proton could be completely annihilated. The value 938 MeV is used so frequently in nuclear and particle physics that it's worth memorizing. It's about 1836 times larger than the electron's rest energy (0.511 MeV), reflecting the proton's greater mass.

If the rest energies of a proton and a neutron (the two constituents of nuclei) are 938.3 and 939.6 MeV respectively, what is the difference in their masses in kilograms?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The mass difference corresponds to the energy difference through $$\Delta E = \Delta m c^2$$. First find $$\Delta E$$ in joules, then solve for $$\Delta m$$.

**Solution**

Energy difference:

$$\Delta E = E_n - E_p = 939.6 - 938.3 = 1.3 \text{ MeV}$$

Converting to joules:

$$\Delta E = 1.3 \text{ MeV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J/MeV} = 2.083 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J}$$

Mass difference:

$$\Delta m = \frac{\Delta E}{c^2} = \frac{2.083 \times 10^{-13}}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{2.083 \times 10^{-13}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}}$$

$$\Delta m = 2.3 \times 10^{-30} \text{ kg}$$

**Discussion**

The neutron is heavier than the proton by about 1.3 MeV/c², or $$2.3 \times 10^{-30}$$ kg. This tiny mass difference (about 0.14% of the proton's mass) has profound consequences. It's why free neutrons are unstable—they decay via beta decay into a proton, electron, and antineutrino with a half-life of about 10 minutes. Inside stable nuclei, however, the nuclear binding energy can make neutrons stable. The mass difference is also crucial for understanding why hydrogen fusion in stars produces energy: four protons (plus two electrons) have more mass than a helium nucleus, with the difference released as energy. This 1.3 MeV difference is measurable with modern mass spectrometry and was one of the early confirmations of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

The Big Bang that began the universe is estimated to have released  $${10}^{68} \text{J} $$
 of energy. How many stars could half this energy create, assuming the average star's mass is  $$ 4.00 \times 10^{30}  \text{kg} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Half the Big Bang energy available is $$E = 0.5 \times 10^{68} = 5 \times 10^{67}$$ J. Each star requires $$E_{\text{star}} = mc^2$$ to create from pure energy. Divide the available energy by the energy per star.

**Solution**

Energy per star:

$$E_{\text{star}} = mc^2 = (4.00 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg})(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2$$

$$E_{\text{star}} = (4.00 \times 10^{30})(9.00 \times 10^{16}) = 3.60 \times 10^{47} \text{ J}$$

Number of stars:

$$N = \frac{E_{\text{available}}}{E_{\text{star}}} = \frac{5 \times 10^{67}}{3.60 \times 10^{47}} = 1.39 \times 10^{20} \text{ stars}$$

**Discussion**

Half the Big Bang energy could theoretically create about $$1.4 \times 10^{20}$$ (140 billion billion) stars the size of our Sun! For perspective, the observable universe contains an estimated $$10^{24}$$ stars, which is 10,000 times more than this calculation suggests. This apparent discrepancy makes sense because:

1. Not all Big Bang energy went into creating matter—much went into kinetic energy, radiation, and dark energy
2. Most matter in the universe is not in stars (dark matter comprises ~85% of all matter)
3. The Big Bang energy estimate includes all forms of energy throughout cosmic history

This problem illustrates the mind-boggling energy scale of the Big Bang and demonstrates that mass-energy conversion, while incredibly powerful at human scales, operates on scales matched by cosmic events.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Use $$E = \Delta m c^2$$ to find the mass converted. (b) Calculate the ratio $$\Delta m/m$$.

**Solution**

(a) Mass converted to energy:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{44} \text{ J}}{(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{44}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}}$$

$$\Delta m = 1.11 \times 10^{27} \text{ kg}$$

(b) Ratio of mass destroyed to original mass:

$$\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{1.11 \times 10^{27}}{2.00 \times 10^{31}} = 5.56 \times 10^{-5}$$

**Discussion**

About $$1.11 \times 10^{27}$$ kg of mass—roughly 0.6% of Earth's mass or 1/1800 of a solar mass—is converted to energy in this supernova explosion. Yet this represents only 0.0056% of the star's total mass! Even this tiny fraction produces an explosion bright enough to briefly outshine an entire galaxy. The ratio $$5.56 \times 10^{-5}$$ (about 1 part in 18,000) demonstrates that nuclear processes, while far more efficient than chemical reactions, still convert only a small percentage of available mass to energy.

Most supernova energy comes from gravitational collapse releasing the star's gravitational binding energy, not from mass directly converting to energy in the explosion itself. The actual mass defect in the nuclear reactions forming iron-peak elements is much smaller. This problem illustrates the immense energy scales involved in stellar death—$$10^{44}$$ J is roughly the energy output of our Sun over several million years, all released in seconds!

(a) Using data from [[Table]](../contents/ch7ConservationOfEnergy#Table1), calculate the mass converted to energy by the fission of 1.00 kg of uranium. (b) What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass,  $$\Delta m/m $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From energy tables, uranium fission releases approximately $$8.0 \times 10^{13}$$ J/kg. Use $$E = \Delta mc^2$$ to find the mass converted. Then calculate the ratio $$\Delta m/m$$.

**Solution**

(a) Energy released by fission of 1.00 kg uranium: $$E = 8.0 \times 10^{13}$$ J

Mass converted to energy:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{8.0 \times 10^{13} \text{ J}}{(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2} = \frac{8.0 \times 10^{13}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 8.9 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg}$$

(b) Ratio of mass destroyed to original mass:

$$\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{8.9 \times 10^{-4} \text{ kg}}{1.00 \text{ kg}} = 8.9 \times 10^{-4} = 0.089\%$$

**Discussion**

Less than one-tenth of one percent (0.089%) of the uranium's mass is converted to energy during fission. While this seems small, it represents an enormous energy release—about $$8 \times 10^{13}$$ J from just 1 kg of fuel, equivalent to burning roughly 3 million kg of coal! This efficiency is what makes nuclear power viable: a single kilogram of uranium can power a city for days.

The small mass loss (0.89 grams per kilogram) explains why mass-energy equivalence wasn't discovered earlier—the mass decrease is measurable with modern precision balances but would have been impossible to detect in the 19th century. This also explains why nuclear reactors don't visibly "shrink" as they operate—the spent fuel looks nearly identical in mass to fresh fuel, despite having released tremendous energy.

 (c) How does this compare with  $$\Delta m/m $$
 for the fission of 1.00 kg of uranium?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

From energy tables, hydrogen fusion releases approximately $$6.4 \times 10^{14}$$ J/kg. Use $$E = \Delta m c^2$$ to find mass converted. Compare this ratio to uranium fission's $$8.9 \times 10^{-4}$$ (from previous problem).

**Solution**

(a) Energy released by fusion of 1.00 kg hydrogen: $$E = 6.4 \times 10^{14}$$ J

Mass converted to energy:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{6.4 \times 10^{14}}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{6.4 \times 10^{14}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 7.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg}$$

(b) Ratio of mass destroyed to original mass:

$$\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{7.1 \times 10^{-3}}{1.00} = 7.1 \times 10^{-3} = 0.71\%$$

(c) Comparison with uranium fission ($$\Delta m/m = 8.9 \times 10^{-4}$$):

$$\frac{(\Delta m/m)_{\text{fusion}}}{(\Delta m/m)_{\text{fission}}} = \frac{7.1 \times 10^{-3}}{8.9 \times 10^{-4}} = 8.0$$

Hydrogen fusion is about 8 times more efficient than uranium fission.

**Discussion**

Fusion converts 0.71% of hydrogen's mass to energy—about 8 times more efficient than fission's 0.089%. This higher efficiency is why fusion is considered the ultimate energy source: the fuel (hydrogen isotopes) is abundant, and each kilogram releases much more energy than fission. The Sun and all stars are powered by fusion for this reason.

The mass converted (7.1 grams per kilogram) is substantial enough to be measurable with precision balances. If we could fusion 1 kg of hydrogen, it would release $$6.4 \times 10^{14}$$ J—enough to power a city for days. The challenge is achieving the extreme temperatures (tens of millions of degrees) and pressures needed to overcome electrostatic repulsion between nuclei. Despite being much more efficient than fission, controlled fusion for power generation remains an engineering challenge, though significant progress is being made in facilities like ITER and the National Ignition Facility.

There is approximately  $${10}^{34} \text{J} $$
 of energy available from fusion of hydrogen in the world's oceans. (a) If  $${10}^{33} \text{J} $$
 of this energy were utilized, what would be the decrease in mass of the oceans? Assume that 0.08% of the mass of a water molecule is converted to energy during the fusion of hydrogen. (b) How great a volume of water does this correspond to? (c) Comment on whether this is a significant fraction of the total mass of the oceans.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Use $$E = \Delta mc^2$$ to find mass decrease. (b) If 0.08% of water mass is converted, the total water mass involved is $$m_{\text{water}} = \Delta m / 0.0008$$. Convert to volume using water density (1000 kg/m³). (c) Compare to ocean mass (~$$1.4 \times 10^{21}$$ kg).

**Solution**

(a) Mass decrease from energy utilization:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{10^{33} \text{ J}}{(3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2} = \frac{10^{33}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 1.11 \times 10^{16} \text{ kg}$$

(b) If 0.08% of water mass converts to energy:

$$m_{\text{water}} = \frac{\Delta m}{0.0008} = \frac{1.11 \times 10^{16}}{0.0008} = 1.39 \times 10^{19} \text{ kg}$$

Volume (using density = 1000 kg/m³):

$$V = \frac{m_{\text{water}}}{\rho} = \frac{1.39 \times 10^{19}}{1000} = 1.39 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}^3 = 1.39 \times 10^{13} \text{ km}^3$$

(c) The oceans contain approximately $$1.4 \times 10^{21}$$ kg of water. The fraction used:

$$\frac{m_{\text{water}}}{m_{\text{oceans}}} = \frac{1.39 \times 10^{19}}{1.4 \times 10^{21}} = 0.01 = 1\%$$

**Discussion**

Remarkably, utilizing just 10% of the available fusion energy ($$10^{33}$$ out of $$10^{34}$$ J) would consume only about 1% of the ocean's water! This demonstrates the incredible energy density of fusion. The volume involved ($$1.4 \times 10^{13}$$ km³) sounds enormous, but it's tiny compared to the total ocean volume ($$1.4 \times 10^9$$ km³). If fusion power becomes practical, the deuterium in Earth's oceans could power human civilization for millions of years without significantly depleting the oceans. This is one reason fusion is considered the "ultimate" energy source—the fuel is virtually inexhaustible and readily available.

A muon has a rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV, and it decays into an electron and a massless particle. (a) If all the lost mass is converted into the electron's kinetic energy, find  $$\gamma  $$
 for the electron. (b) What is the electron's velocity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The energy available for kinetic energy is the mass difference between muon and electron: $$\Delta E = E_{\mu} - E_e = 105.7 - 0.511 = 105.2$$ MeV. This becomes the electron's kinetic energy. Use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_ec^2$$ to find $$\gamma$$.

**Solution**

(a) Kinetic energy of electron:

$$KE = E_{\mu} - E_{e,\text{rest}} = 105.7 - 0.511 = 105.2 \text{ MeV}$$

Using $$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_ec^2$$:

$$105.2 = (\gamma - 1)(0.511)$$

$$\gamma - 1 = \frac{105.2}{0.511} = 205.9$$

$$\gamma = 207$$

(b) From $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$:

$$207 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{207} = 0.004831$$

$$1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 2.334 \times 10^{-5}$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 2.334 \times 10^{-5} = 0.9999767$$

$$v = 0.999988c$$

**Discussion**

The electron from muon decay emerges with $$\gamma = 207$$, traveling at 99.9988% the speed of light! Its kinetic energy (105 MeV) is over 200 times its rest energy (0.511 MeV), making it ultra-relativistic. At this speed, the electron differs from light speed by only 0.0012%, or about 3,600 m/s out of 300,000,000 m/s.

Such energetic electrons from muon decay are important in cosmic ray physics and particle detectors. The problem simplifies reality—actual muon decay produces an electron, electron antineutrino, and muon neutrino, with the energy shared among all three. But this illustrates the extreme velocities achievable when light particles receive energy from heavy particle decays. The electron's enormous $$\gamma$$ factor means relativistic effects dominate: its momentum, time dilation, and length contraction are all increased by a factor of ~200 compared to classical predictions.

A  $$\pi  $$
-meson is a particle that decays into a muon and a massless particle. The  $$\pi  $$
-meson has a rest mass energy of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV. Suppose the  $$\pi  $$
-meson is at rest and all of the missing mass goes into the muon's kinetic energy. How fast will the muon move?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Energy conservation: $$E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}$$. Since the $$\pi$$ is at rest, $$E_{\pi} = 139.6$$ MeV. The muon has rest energy 105.7 MeV plus kinetic energy. The missing mass-energy ($$139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$$ MeV) goes into kinetic energy. Use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$ to find $$\gamma$$, then solve for $$v$$.

**Solution**

Kinetic energy of muon:

$$KE_{\mu} = E_{\pi} - E_{\mu,\text{rest}} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \text{ MeV}$$

Using $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$:

$$33.9 = (\gamma - 1)(105.7)$$

$$\gamma - 1 = \frac{33.9}{105.7} = 0.3207$$

$$\gamma = 1.3207$$

From $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$:

$$1.3207 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{1.3207} = 0.7571$$

$$1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.5732$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.4268$$

$$v = 0.653c$$

**Discussion**

The muon emerges traveling at about 65% the speed of light. This problem illustrates several important principles: (1) energy conservation applies to particle decays, (2) "missing mass" is converted to kinetic energy, and (3) momentum conservation also applies (the massless particle—a neutrino—carries away momentum to balance the muon's momentum). The fact that the muon takes most of the available energy but not all of it is due to momentum conservation: in the pion's rest frame, the products must have equal and opposite momenta, so the massless neutrino (traveling at $$c$$) must carry significant energy despite having no mass.

**Strategy**

In this hypothetical universe where $$c = 45.0$$ m/s, the car at 30 m/s is highly relativistic ($$v = 0.667c$$). Calculate $$\gamma$$ and use $$KE_{\text{rel}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$. Compare to classical $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate $$\gamma$$ with $$c = 45.0$$ m/s, $$v = 30.0$$ m/s:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(30.0)^2}{(45.0)^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{900}{2025}}}$$

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.4444}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.5556}} = \frac{1}{0.7454} = 1.342$$

Relativistic kinetic energy:

$$KE_{\text{rel}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (1.342 - 1)(1000)(45.0)^2$$

$$KE_{\text{rel}} = (0.342)(1000)(2025) = 6.92 \times 10^5 \text{ J}$$

(b) Classical kinetic energy:

$$KE_{\text{class}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1000)(30.0)^2 = 4.50 \times 10^5 \text{ J}$$

Ratio:

$$\frac{KE_{\text{rel}}}{KE_{\text{class}}} = \frac{6.92 \times 10^5}{4.50 \times 10^5} = 1.54$$

**Discussion**

In this imaginary universe with $$c = 45$$ m/s (about 100 mph), everyday velocities would show dramatic relativistic effects! A car traveling at 30 m/s (67 mph) would have $$\gamma = 1.34$$, and its kinetic energy would be 54% greater than classical predictions. The driver would also age more slowly, observers would see the car contracted in length, and accelerating the car would get progressively harder as it approached 45 m/s.

This thought experiment helps us understand why we don't notice relativity in daily life: in our universe with $$c = 3 \times 10^8$$ m/s, this same 30 m/s represents only $$10^{-7}c$$, giving $$\gamma = 1.0000000000005$$—indistinguishable from 1 for all practical purposes. Relativistic effects scale with $$v^2/c^2$$, so reducing $$c$$ from $$3 \times 10^8$$ to 45 m/s increases this ratio by a factor of $$10^{13}$$, making relativistic effects readily observable.

Alpha decay is nuclear decay in which a helium nucleus is emitted. If the helium nucleus has a mass of  $$ 6.80 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg} $$
 and is given 5.00 MeV of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

First check if relativistic treatment is needed by comparing KE to rest energy. The helium nucleus (alpha particle) has rest energy $$E_0 = mc^2$$. If $$KE \ll E_0$$, classical formula $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ suffices. Otherwise, use relativistic $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$.

**Solution**

Rest energy of alpha particle:

$$E_0 = mc^2 = (6.80 \times 10^{-27})(3.00 \times 10^8)^2 = 6.12 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J}$$

Converting to MeV: $$E_0 = \frac{6.12 \times 10^{-10}}{1.602 \times 10^{-13}} = 3820 \text{ MeV}$$

Since $$KE = 5.00$$ MeV $$\ll 3820$$ MeV, classical treatment is adequate:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot KE}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(5.00 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13})}{6.80 \times 10^{-27}}}$$

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{1.602 \times 10^{-12}}{6.80 \times 10^{-27}}} = \sqrt{2.356 \times 10^{14}} = 1.54 \times 10^7 \text{ m/s}$$

As a fraction of $$c$$: $$v = \frac{1.54 \times 10^7}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 0.0513c$$

**Discussion**

The alpha particle travels at about 5% the speed of light, or 15,400 km/s. At this velocity, relativistic corrections are only about $$\frac{1}{2}\gamma^2 v^2/c^2 \approx 0.13\%$$, confirming that classical mechanics is adequate. This velocity is typical for alpha particles from radioactive decay. While 5% of $$c$$ seems fast, it's slow enough that alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air. This low penetration (despite high energy) is due to the alpha particle's relatively large mass and double positive charge, which cause strong interactions with matter.

(a) Beta decay is nuclear decay in which an electron is emitted. If the electron is given 0.750 MeV of kinetic energy, what is its velocity? (b) Comment on how the high velocity is consistent with the kinetic energy as it compares to the rest mass energy of the electron.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_ec^2$$ where $$m_ec^2 = 0.511$$ MeV. Solve for $$\gamma$$, then find $$v$$ from $$\gamma$$. (b) Compare KE to rest energy.

**Solution**

(a) From $$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_ec^2$$:

$$0.750 = (\gamma - 1)(0.511)$$

$$\gamma - 1 = \frac{0.750}{0.511} = 1.468$$

$$\gamma = 2.468$$

From $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$:

$$2.468 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{2.468} = 0.4052$$

$$1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.1642$$

$$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.8358$$

$$v = 0.914c$$

(b) The electron's kinetic energy (0.750 MeV) is about 147% of its rest energy (0.511 MeV). Whenever $$KE > m_ec^2$$, the particle must be highly relativistic with $$v$$ close to $$c$$. Indeed, at $$v = 0.914c$$, the electron is traveling at over 90% light speed. This high velocity is consistent with the large kinetic energy: classical physics would predict $$v = \sqrt{2KE/m}$$, which would give $$v > c$$ (impossible!), confirming that relativistic treatment is essential.

**Discussion**

Beta particles (electrons from nuclear decay) with 0.75 MeV kinetic energy are highly relativistic, traveling at 91% the speed of light. Such energetic beta particles can penetrate several millimeters of aluminum or several meters of air. The fact that $$KE > E_0$$ (kinetic exceeds rest energy) is a hallmark of ultra-relativistic particles.

In beta decay, electrons are emitted with a continuous energy spectrum from near zero up to a maximum determined by the nuclear transition energy. A 0.75 MeV electron would be near the high end of many beta spectra. The relativistic velocity has practical implications: beta particle detectors must account for time dilation and length contraction effects, and shielding calculations must use relativistic kinematics rather than classical formulas.

A positron is an antimatter version of the electron, having exactly the same mass. When a positron and an electron meet, they annihilate, converting all of their mass into energy. (a) Find the energy released, assuming negligible kinetic energy before the annihilation. (b) If this energy is given to a proton in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity? (c) If this energy is given to another electron in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Two electron rest masses (electron + positron) are converted: $$E = 2m_ec^2$$. (b) For proton: $$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_pc^2 = 2m_ec^2$$, solve for $$v$$. (c) Similarly for electron: $$(\gamma - 1)m_ec^2 = 2m_ec^2$$, giving $$\gamma = 3$$.

**Solution**

(a) Energy released:

$$E = 2m_ec^2 = 2(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(3.00 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.64 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J}$$

In MeV: $$E = 2(0.511) = 1.02 \text{ MeV}$$

(b) For proton ($$m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27}$$ kg, rest energy 938 MeV):

$$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_pc^2 = 1.02 \text{ MeV}$$

$$\gamma - 1 = \frac{1.02}{938} = 0.001088$$

$$\gamma = 1.001088$$

Since $$\gamma \approx 1$$, use classical approximation:

$$v = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx c\sqrt{2(\gamma-1)} = c\sqrt{2(0.001088)} = 0.0467c$$

Or $$v = 1.40 \times 10^7 \text{ m/s}$$

(c) For electron:

$$(\gamma - 1)m_ec^2 = 2m_ec^2$$

$$\gamma - 1 = 2$$

$$\gamma = 3$$

$$v = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{9}} = c\sqrt{\frac{8}{9}} = 0.943c$$

**Discussion**

Part (a) shows that electron-positron annihilation releases 1.02 MeV, which appears as two gamma-ray photons in practice (to conserve momentum). Part (b) demonstrates that this energy barely accelerates a proton—only to 4.7% of $$c$$—because the proton is 1836 times heavier than the electron. Part (c) shows that the same energy accelerates an electron to 94% of $$c$$, illustrating how particle mass dramatically affects the velocity achieved for a given energy. This is why particle accelerators use electrons for certain experiments: they reach relativistic speeds with much less energy than protons require.

What is the kinetic energy in MeV of a  $$\pi  $$

 as measured in the laboratory, and  $$0.840 \times 10^{-16} \text{s} $$
 when at rest relative to an observer, given that its rest energy is 135 MeV?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Time dilation relates the lifetimes: $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$, so $$\gamma = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t_0}$$. Then use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$ where $$mc^2 = 135$$ MeV.

**Solution**

Calculate $$\gamma$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t_0} = \frac{1.40 \times 10^{-16}}{0.840 \times 10^{-16}} = \frac{1.40}{0.840} = 1.667$$

Kinetic energy:

$$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (1.667 - 1)(135 \text{ MeV})$$

$$KE = (0.667)(135) = 90.0 \text{ MeV}$$

**Discussion**

The pion's lifetime measured in the lab ($$1.40 \times 10^{-16}$$ s) is 1.67 times longer than its proper lifetime ($$0.840 \times 10^{-16}$$ s), indicating $$\gamma = 1.67$$. This corresponds to a velocity of about $$v = 0.745c$$. The kinetic energy of 90 MeV is substantial—about 67% of the pion's rest energy.

This problem beautifully illustrates the connection between time dilation and energy. The pion's extended lifetime in the lab frame is a direct consequence of its high energy and velocity. Such relativistic pions are commonly produced in particle accelerators and cosmic ray interactions. The fact that we can infer the pion's kinetic energy simply by measuring how long it lives (compared to its known rest lifetime) is a practical application of relativity in particle physics. Detectors routinely use lifetime measurements to determine particle energies and velocities.

Find the kinetic energy in MeV of a neutron with a measured life span of 2065 s, given its rest energy is 939.6 MeV, and rest life span is 900s.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

Time dilation relates the lifetimes: $$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$, so $$\gamma = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t_0} = \frac{2065}{900}$$. Then use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$ where $$mc^2 = 939.6$$ MeV.

**Solution**

Calculate $$\gamma$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{2065 \text{ s}}{900 \text{ s}} = 2.294$$

Kinetic energy:

$$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (2.294 - 1)(939.6 \text{ MeV})$$

$$KE = (1.294)(939.6) = 1216 \text{ MeV} = 1.22 \text{ GeV}$$

**Discussion**

This relativistic neutron has kinetic energy of about 1.22 GeV, which is greater than its rest mass energy (940 MeV). At this energy, $$\gamma = 2.3$$, meaning the neutron's lifetime is extended by that factor, allowing it to travel much farther before decaying than it would at rest. Such high-energy neutrons are produced in cosmic ray interactions and particle accelerators. The extended lifetime due to time dilation is crucial for detecting these particles—without relativistic effects, they would decay before reaching detectors. This problem beautifully connects time dilation with energy, showing how measuring a particle's lifetime can reveal its kinetic energy.

 (b) Is  $$E\approx \text{pc} $$
 when  $$\gamma = 30.0 $$ ,
 as for the astronaut discussed in the twin paradox?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Start with the energy-momentum relation $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$ and the total energy $$E = \gamma mc^2$$. Substitute and simplify. (b) Calculate the ratio $$(pc)/(mc^2)$$ when $$\gamma = 30$$ and compare $$E$$ to $$pc$$.

**Solution**

(a) Starting with $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$ and $$E = \gamma mc^2$$:

$$(\gamma mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$

$$\gamma^2 m^2c^4 = (pc)^2 + m^2c^4$$

$$(pc)^2 = \gamma^2 m^2c^4 - m^2c^4 = (\gamma^2 - 1)m^2c^4$$

Dividing both sides by $$(mc^2)^2$$:

$$\frac{(pc)^2}{(mc^2)^2} = \gamma^2 - 1$$

This shows that as $$\gamma$$ becomes large, $$(pc)^2 \approx \gamma^2(mc^2)^2$$, so $$pc \approx \gamma mc^2 \gg mc^2$$.

(b) When $$\gamma = 30.0$$:

$$\frac{(pc)^2}{(mc^2)^2} = \gamma^2 - 1 = 900 - 1 = 899$$

$$\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \sqrt{899} = 29.98 \approx 30$$

Total energy: $$E = \gamma mc^2 = 30mc^2$$

Momentum term: $$pc = 29.98mc^2 \approx 30mc^2$$

Therefore $$E \approx pc$$ (they differ by only 0.07%).

More precisely: $$E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{899 + 1}(mc^2) = 30.00mc^2$$

**Discussion**

Part (a) proves that for ultra-relativistic particles ($$\gamma \gg 1$$), the momentum energy $$pc$$ dominates over rest energy $$mc^2$$. Specifically, $$pc/mc^2 = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \approx \gamma$$ when $$\gamma$$ is large.

Part (b) shows that at $$\gamma = 30$$, the total energy (30$$mc^2$$) is almost entirely kinetic, with rest energy ($$mc^2$$) contributing only about 3%. The approximation $$E \approx pc$$ holds to within 0.07%. This is the ultra-relativistic regime where particles behave almost like massless particles (photons). The astronaut in the twin paradox traveling at $$\gamma = 30$$ has so much kinetic energy that treating the spaceship as nearly massless simplifies calculations without significant error.

This relation is crucial in particle physics: at high energies (GeV to TeV scales), all particles effectively behave as if massless, and $$E = pc$$ becomes an excellent approximation.

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Calculate $$\gamma$$ for $$v = 0.250c$$, then $$E = \gamma mc^2$$ where neutron rest energy is 939.6 MeV. (b) Use $$p = \gamma mv$$. (c) Compare $$E$$ to $$pc$$ and discuss using $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$.

**Solution**

(a) Calculate $$\gamma$$:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.250c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.0625}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.9375}} = 1.033$$

Total energy:

$$E = \gamma mc^2 = (1.033)(939.6 \text{ MeV}) = 970.6 \text{ MeV}$$

(b) Momentum (neutron mass $$m = 1.675 \times 10^{-27}$$ kg):

$$p = \gamma mv = (1.033)(1.675 \times 10^{-27})(0.250)(3.00 \times 10^8)$$

$$p = 1.295 \times 10^{-19} \text{ kg·m/s}$$

In MeV/c units: $$pc = \gamma mvc = (1.033)(939.6 \text{ MeV})(0.250) = 242.5 \text{ MeV}$$

(c) Compare $$E$$ to $$pc$$:

$$E = 970.6 \text{ MeV}, \quad pc = 242.5 \text{ MeV}$$

Clearly $$E \not\approx pc$$. Using $$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$:

$$(970.6)^2 = (242.5)^2 + (939.6)^2$$

$$942,064 = 58,806 + 882,848 = 941,654$$ ✓ (close agreement within rounding)

The approximation $$E \approx pc$$ is only valid when $$pc \gg mc^2$$, i.e., when $$\gamma \gg 1$$. Here $$\gamma = 1.033$$ (barely relativistic), so the rest energy term dominates: $$mc^2 = 939.6$$ MeV is much larger than the momentum term $$pc = 242.5$$ MeV.

**Discussion**

At $$v = 0.250c$$, the neutron is mildly relativistic but not ultra-relativistic. The total energy is dominated by rest mass (97% rest energy, only 3% kinetic energy). For the approximation $$E \approx pc$$ to hold, we typically need $$\gamma > 10$$, where kinetic energy far exceeds rest energy. This problem illustrates the transition from non-relativistic ($$E \approx mc^2$$) to ultra-relativistic ($$E \approx pc$$) regimes, with this neutron falling in between.

What is  $$\gamma  $$
 for a proton having a mass energy of 938.3 MeV accelerated through an effective potential of 1.0 TV (teravolt) at Fermilab outside Chicago?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The proton gains kinetic energy equal to its charge times the potential: $$KE = eV = 1.0$$ TeV $$= 1.0 \times 10^6$$ MeV. Use $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$ to find $$\gamma$$.

**Solution**

Kinetic energy gained:

$$KE = 1.0 \text{ TeV} = 1.0 \times 10^6 \text{ MeV}$$

Using $$KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$$:

$$1.0 \times 10^6 = (\gamma - 1)(938.3)$$

$$\gamma - 1 = \frac{1.0 \times 10^6}{938.3} = 1065.8$$

$$\gamma = 1066.8 \approx 1.07 \times 10^3$$

**Discussion**

At Fermilab's Tevatron collider (now decommissioned), protons were accelerated to 1 TeV, giving $$\gamma \approx 1066$$. These protons were traveling at $$v = c\sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2} \approx c(1 - 4.4 \times 10^{-7})$$, differing from light speed by less than one part in two million! Their kinetic energy was over 1000 times their rest energy.

At this energy, the protons' momentum, time dilation, and length contraction are all magnified by a factor of ~1000 compared to rest values. From the proton's perspective, the Tevatron ring (about 6 km circumference) appears contracted to only 6 meters! These ultra-relativistic protons, when collided with anti-protons (also at 1 TeV), provided collision energies up to 2 TeV, allowing discovery of the top quark and detailed studies of the Standard Model. Today, the Large Hadron Collider achieves even higher energies (up to 7 TeV per proton), with $$\gamma \approx 7500$$.

**Solution**

(a) Kinetic energy of electron:

$$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_ec^2 = (1.00 \times 10^5 - 1)(0.511 \text{ MeV})$$

$$KE \approx (1.00 \times 10^5)(0.511 \text{ MeV}) = 51,100 \text{ MeV} = 51.1 \text{ GeV}$$

Accelerating potential:

$$V = \frac{KE}{e} = 51.1 \text{ GV (gigavolts)}$$

Or $$V = 5.11 \times 10^{10}$$ V

(b) Total energy:

$$E = \gamma m_ec^2 = (1.00 \times 10^5)(0.511 \text{ MeV}) = 51,100 \text{ MeV} = 51.1 \text{ GeV}$$

Note that $$KE \approx E$$ since $$\gamma \gg 1$$ (rest energy is negligible compared to total energy).

**Discussion**

At $$\gamma = 10^5$$, the electron's velocity is extremely close to $$c$$: $$v = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx c(1 - 5 \times 10^{-11})$$, differing from light speed by less than one part in 10 billion! The 51 GeV energy was typical for SLAC's highest-energy experiments. At this energy, the electron's kinetic energy is 100,000 times its rest mass, demonstrating the ultra-relativistic regime where essentially all energy goes into kinetic energy rather than increasing rest mass. This is why particle physicists often quote energies in GeV rather than speeds—at these energies, everything travels at essentially $$c$$, so energy is the more meaningful parameter.

 what is the ratio of mass destroyed to original mass,  $$\Delta m/m $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) From energy tables, crude oil releases about $$4.2 \times 10^7$$ J/kg. Calculate mass of 200 L of oil, multiply by energy density, then use $$E = \Delta mc^2$$. (b) Calculate the ratio.

**Solution**

(a) Mass of oil in 200 L barrel:

$$m = \rho V = (750 \text{ kg/m}^3)(200 \text{ L} \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3/\text{L}) = (750)(0.200) = 150 \text{ kg}$$

Energy released:

$$E = (150 \text{ kg})(4.2 \times 10^7 \text{ J/kg}) = 6.3 \times 10^9 \text{ J}$$

(Actually, for crude oil: $$E \approx 5.9 \times 10^9$$ J per barrel)

Let's use $$E = 5.9 \times 10^9$$ J:

Mass destroyed:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{5.9 \times 10^9}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{5.9 \times 10^9}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \text{ kg}$$

(b) Ratio:

$$\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{6.56 \times 10^{-8}}{150} = 4.37 \times 10^{-10}$$

**Discussion**

Burning a 200-liter barrel of crude oil releases about 5.9 billion joules, which corresponds to a mass loss of only $$6.56 \times 10^{-8}$$ kg (65.6 nanograms). The ratio $$4.37 \times 10^{-10}$$ means less than one part in two billion of the oil's mass is converted to energy! This is why we didn't discover mass-energy equivalence through chemical reactions—the mass changes are utterly negligible.

Compare this to nuclear fission ($$\Delta m/m \approx 10^{-3}$$) or fusion ($$\Delta m/m \approx 10^{-2}$$): chemical reactions are a million times less efficient at converting mass to energy. Nevertheless, that tiny 65 nanogram mass loss represents enough energy to drive a car several hundred kilometers. If we could convert the entire 150 kg barrel to energy (rather than just 0.00000001% of it), the energy released would equal several thousand nuclear weapons!

- About 10,000 times the energy released by the Hiroshima bomb

This staggering energy density explains why even tiny amounts of mass-energy conversion (as in nuclear reactions) produce enormous energy outputs, and why complete matter-antimatter annihilation would be the ultimate energy source—if we could harness it practically.

A Van de Graaff accelerator utilizes a 50.0 MV potential difference to accelerate charged particles such as protons. (a) What is the velocity of a proton accelerated by such a potential? (b) An electron?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

The kinetic energy gained equals the charge times voltage: $$KE = eV = 50.0$$ MeV. For (a) proton (rest energy 938 MeV), check if relativistic treatment needed. For (b) electron (rest energy 0.511 MeV), definitely relativistic.

**Solution**

(a) Proton: $$KE = 50.0$$ MeV, $$m_pc^2 = 938$$ MeV

Since $$KE < m_pc^2$$, we could use either formula. Using relativistic:

$$KE = (\gamma - 1)m_pc^2$$

$$50.0 = (\gamma - 1)(938)$$

$$\gamma = 1 + \frac{50.0}{938} = 1.0533$$

$$v = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{1.0533^2}} = c\sqrt{1-0.9009} = c\sqrt{0.0991}$$

$$v = 0.315c$$

(b) Electron: $$KE = 50.0$$ MeV, $$m_ec^2 = 0.511$$ MeV

$$50.0 = (\gamma - 1)(0.511)$$

$$\gamma = 1 + \frac{50.0}{0.511} = 1 + 97.85 = 98.85$$

$$v = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{(98.85)^2}} = c\sqrt{1-1.023 \times 10^{-4}}$$

$$v = c\sqrt{0.9999} = 0.99995c$$

**Discussion**

The 50 MV potential accelerates protons to only 31.5% of light speed because the proton's rest energy (938 MeV) is much larger than the 50 MeV kinetic energy gained. The proton is only mildly relativistic with $$\gamma = 1.05$$.

In stark contrast, the same potential accelerates electrons to 99.995% of light speed! The electron's rest energy (0.511 MeV) is tiny compared to the 50 MeV gained, making it highly relativistic with $$\gamma \approx 99$$. This dramatic difference illustrates why electrons reach relativistic speeds much more easily than protons—their rest mass is 1836 times smaller.

Van de Graaff accelerators can achieve potentials up to about 25 MV in practice, so this 50 MV example is at the high end. These accelerators are used for nuclear physics research, ion implantation, and radiation therapy. The vastly different final velocities for protons vs. electrons affect beam focusing, shielding requirements, and applications.

Suppose you use an average of  $$500 kW·h $$
 of electric energy per month in your home. (a) How long would 1.00 g of mass converted to electric energy with an efficiency of 38.0% last you? (b) How many homes could be supplied at the  $$500 kW·h $$
 per month rate for one year by the energy from the described mass conversion?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Total energy from 1.00 g is $$E = mc^2$$. With 38% efficiency, available energy is $$0.38E$$. Divide by monthly usage. (b) Calculate total energy for all homes for one year and divide into available energy.

**Solution**

(a) Energy from 1.00 g = $$10^{-3}$$ kg:

$$E = mc^2 = (10^{-3})(3.00 \times 10^8)^2 = 9.00 \times 10^{13} \text{ J}$$

Useful energy (38% efficient):

$$E_{\text{useful}} = 0.38 \times 9.00 \times 10^{13} = 3.42 \times 10^{13} \text{ J}$$

Convert to kW·h: $$E_{\text{useful}} = \frac{3.42 \times 10^{13}}{3.6 \times 10^6} = 9.50 \times 10^{6} \text{ kW·h}$$

Number of months:

$$t = \frac{9.50 \times 10^6}{500} = 19,000 \text{ months} = 1583 \text{ years}$$

(b) Energy needed for one home for one year:

$$E_{\text{home/year}} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \text{ kW·h}$$

Number of homes for one year:

$$N = \frac{9.50 \times 10^6}{6000} = 1583 \text{ homes}$$

**Discussion**

One gram of mass, converted to electricity at 38% efficiency (typical for a good power plant), could power your home for over 1500 years, or power 1583 homes for an entire year! This demonstrates the incredible energy density inherent in mass. For comparison, a typical coal plant burns about 2-3 million kg of coal per year to produce similar energy output. The 38% efficiency assumed is realistic for modern power plants, where much energy is lost as waste heat. If we could achieve 100% efficiency, that single gram would last over 4000 years!

(a) A nuclear power plant converts energy from nuclear fission into electricity with an efficiency of 35.0%. How much mass is destroyed in one year to produce a continuous 1000 MW of electric power? (b) Do you think it would be possible to observe this mass loss if the total mass of the fuel is  $${10}^{4} \text{kg} $$ ?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Calculate total electrical energy output in one year, divide by efficiency to get total nuclear energy needed, then use $$E = \Delta m c^2$$. (b) Compare mass loss to total fuel mass.

**Solution**

(a) Electrical energy output in one year:

$$E_{\text{elec}} = P \times t = (1000 \times 10^6 \text{ W})(365.25 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ s})$$

$$E_{\text{elec}} = (10^9)(3.156 \times 10^7) = 3.156 \times 10^{16} \text{ J}$$

Total nuclear energy needed (at 35% efficiency):

$$E_{\text{total}} = \frac{E_{\text{elec}}}{0.35} = \frac{3.156 \times 10^{16}}{0.35} = 9.017 \times 10^{16} \text{ J}$$

Mass destroyed:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{c^2} = \frac{9.017 \times 10^{16}}{(3.00 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{9.017 \times 10^{16}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 1.00 \text{ kg}$$

(b) Mass loss as percentage of fuel:

$$\frac{\Delta m}{m_{\text{fuel}}} = \frac{1.00}{10^4} = 10^{-4} = 0.01\%$$

**Discussion**

A 1000 MW nuclear plant destroys exactly 1 kg of mass per year when operating at 35% efficiency. This mass loss represents 0.01% of the 10,000 kg fuel load—measurable with precise scales but not visually observable. You couldn't tell by looking whether the fuel rods had lost 100 grams or 1 kilogram.

However, this mass loss IS routinely measured in practice. Nuclear fuel is weighed before and after use, and the decrease matches predictions from Einstein's equation. The "missing" mass appears as:
- Heat (used to make steam)
- Radioactive decay products with slightly less total mass
- Neutrinos carrying away energy
- Kinetic energy of fission fragments

For perspective, consuming 1 kg/year means the plant converts mass to energy at $$\Delta m/\Delta t = 32$$ nanograms per second—tiny, yet sufficient to power a city. If coal plants could convert mass with the same efficiency, 1 kg of coal would power the same city for over a year instead of for seconds!

Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount. (a) What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of 250 km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.) (b) If the ship has a mass of  $$1.00 \times 10^{5}  \text{kg} $$
 (100 tons), what total yield nuclear explosion in tons of TNT is needed?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) Calculate orbital velocity at 250 km, find $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ and $$PE = mgh$$ (approximation for small h), total energy $$E = KE + PE$$, then $$\Delta m = E/c^2$$. (b) Convert energy to TNT equivalent (1 ton TNT $$\approx 4.2 \times 10^9$$ J).

**Solution**

(a) Orbital velocity at radius $$r = R_E + h = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 2.5 \times 10^5 = 6.62 \times 10^6$$ m:

$$v_{\text{orb}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = \sqrt{\frac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{6.62 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{6.01 \times 10^7} = 7750 \text{ m/s}$$

For 100,000 kg rocket:

Kinetic energy: $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(10^5)(7750)^2 = 3.00 \times 10^{12} \text{ J}$$

Potential energy: $$PE = mgh = (10^5)(9.8)(2.5 \times 10^5) = 2.45 \times 10^{11} \text{ J}$$

Total energy: $$E = 3.00 \times 10^{12} + 2.45 \times 10^{11} = 3.245 \times 10^{12} \text{ J}$$

Mass to destroy: $$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{3.245 \times 10^{12}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 3.61 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg}$$

Fraction: $$\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{3.61 \times 10^{-5}}{10^5} = 3.61 \times 10^{-10}$$

(b) TNT equivalent (1 ton TNT = $$4.2 \times 10^9$$ J):

$$\text{TNT equivalent} = \frac{3.245 \times 10^{12}}{4.2 \times 10^9} = 773 \text{ tons}$$

**Discussion**

Only $$3.61 \times 10^{-5}$$ kg (36 milligrams) of mass-energy would suffice to launch a 100-ton rocket to orbit! The fraction $$3.6 \times 10^{-10}$$ is incredibly tiny—less than one part in a billion. This demonstrates the immense energy density in mass: complete conversion of just 36 mg equals 773 tons of TNT, enough to devastate a city block.

This is why nuclear rockets were seriously considered in the 1960s (Project Orion, NERVA). Even with very inefficient conversion (say 1%), you'd need only 3.6 grams of fuel. However, the practical challenges were insurmountable:
- Safely containing nuclear reactions
- Directing energy into thrust rather than waste heat
- Preventing radioactive contamination
- Political and safety concerns about launching nuclear materials

Chemical rockets burn thousands of tons of fuel to reach orbit because chemical reactions convert only $$~10^{-10}$$ of fuel mass to energy, while nuclear reactions could theoretically convert $$~10^{-3}$$ (10,000 times more efficient). Modern nuclear rocket research focuses on nuclear thermal (heating propellant) rather than direct mass conversion.

The Sun produces energy at a rate of  $$ 4.00 \times 10^{26}  $$
 W by the fusion of hydrogen. (a) How many kilograms of hydrogen undergo fusion each second? (b) If the Sun is 90.0% hydrogen and half of this can undergo fusion before the Sun changes character, how long could it produce energy at its current rate? (c) How many kilograms of mass is the Sun losing per second? (d) What fraction of its mass will it have lost in the time found in part (b)?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) From earlier problems, fusion converts 0.7% of hydrogen mass to energy. Use $$P = E/t$$ to find mass/time. (c) Direct use of $$E = \Delta mc^2$$. (b) Calculate fusionable hydrogen and divide by consumption rate. (d) Find fraction lost.

**Solution**

(a) Energy per second: $$E = Pt = (4.00 \times 10^{26})(1) = 4.00 \times 10^{26}$$ J

Mass converted per second:

$$\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{4.00 \times 10^{26}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 4.44 \times 10^9 \text{ kg/s}$$

Since fusion converts 0.7% of hydrogen to energy ($$\Delta m/m = 0.007$$):

Hydrogen fused per second: $$m_H = \frac{\Delta m}{0.007} = \frac{4.44 \times 10^9}{0.007} = 6.34 \times 10^{11} \text{ kg/s}$$

(b) Sun's mass: $$M_{\odot} = 2.00 \times 10^{30}$$ kg

Fusionable hydrogen: $$m_{\text{fusionable}} = 0.90 \times 0.50 \times 2.00 \times 10^{30} = 9.00 \times 10^{29}$$ kg

Lifetime: $$t = \frac{m_{\text{fusionable}}}{m_H \text{ per second}} = \frac{9.00 \times 10^{29}}{6.34 \times 10^{11}} = 1.42 \times 10^{18} \text{ s}$$

Converting to years: $$t = \frac{1.42 \times 10^{18}}{3.156 \times 10^7} = 4.5 \times 10^{10} \text{ years}$$

(c) From part (a): $$\Delta m = 4.44 \times 10^9$$ kg/s

(d) Total mass lost: $$\Delta m_{\text{total}} = (4.44 \times 10^9)(1.42 \times 10^{18}) = 6.3 \times 10^{27}$$ kg

Fraction: $$\frac{\Delta m_{\text{total}}}{M_{\odot}} = \frac{6.3 \times 10^{27}}{2.00 \times 10^{30}} = 0.00315 = 0.32\%$$

**Discussion**

The Sun fuses 634 billion kg of hydrogen every second, converting 4.4 billion kg of that mass into pure energy. To visualize: every second, the Sun loses mass equivalent to millions of cars, yet this is utterly negligible compared to its total mass ($$2 \times 10^{30}$$ kg).

At this rate, the Sun can shine for 45 billion years before exhausting its fusionable hydrogen. However, the Sun is only 4.6 billion years old and will become a red giant in about 5 billion years, long before running out of fuel. The discrepancy arises because:
1. Not all hydrogen is in the core where fusion occurs
2. Fusion rate increases with age as the core contracts and heats
3. Red giant phase begins when core hydrogen is depleted, even though envelope hydrogen remains

Over its 10-billion-year main sequence lifetime, the Sun will lose only 0.32% of its mass—a tiny fraction, yet representing $$6 \times 10^{27}$$ kg, or 3000 times Earth's mass! This lost mass becomes the light, heat, and solar wind that make life on Earth possible. Every photon we receive from the Sun represents a tiny piece of the Sun's vanishing mass, converted to energy 150 million kilometers away.

**Unreasonable Results**

A proton has a mass of $$ 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{kg} $$ . A physicist
measures the proton's total energy to be 50.0 MeV. (a) What is the proton's
kinetic energy? (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which
assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">

**Strategy**

(a) The proton's rest energy is approximately 938 MeV. Use $$KE = E - E_0$$. (b) Check if the result is physically reasonable. (c) Identify the problematic assumption.

**Solution**

(a) Proton rest energy:

$$E_0 = m_pc^2 = 938 \text{ MeV}$$

Kinetic energy:

$$KE = E - E_0 = 50.0 - 938 = -888 \text{ MeV}$$

(b) **This result is unreasonable because kinetic energy cannot be negative.** Kinetic energy represents the energy of motion and must always be ≥ 0. A negative kinetic energy would imply that the proton has less than its rest energy, which violates the fundamental relation $$E = \gamma mc^2$$ where $$\gamma \geq 1$$.

(c) The unreasonable assumption is that the **total energy is only 50.0 MeV**. The total energy of any massive particle must be at least its rest energy. For a proton, $$E_{\text{min}} = m_pc^2 = 938$$ MeV. A measured total energy of 50 MeV is less than the rest energy, which is impossible.

The physicist may have mistakenly measured the kinetic energy (50 MeV is a reasonable KE for a proton) and called it total energy, or there was an error in the measurement. If the proton truly has $$KE = 50$$ MeV, its total energy would be $$E = 938 + 50 = 988$$ MeV.

**Discussion**

This "unreasonable results" problem teaches an important lesson about total vs. kinetic energy in relativity. In classical physics, where rest energy isn't considered, we might casually use "energy" to mean kinetic energy. In relativity, we must be precise: total energy $$E = \gamma mc^2$$ always exceeds rest energy $$mc^2$$, with the difference being kinetic energy. Any measurement showing total energy less than rest energy signals an error in measurement or interpretation.
