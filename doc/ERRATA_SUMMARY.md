## Impact Assessment

### High Impact - Student Learning (28 corrections)

Students would get wrong answers or learn incorrect concepts without these fixes.

### Medium Impact - Clarity (15 corrections)

Improvements in understanding through better explanations and updated references.

### Low Impact - Polish (27 corrections)

Grammar, formatting, and minor wording improvements not applied (mostly CNXML-specific).

---

## Quality Assurance

All applied corrections have been:

- ✅ Verified against OpenStax commit history
- ✅ Checked for problem/solution consistency
- ✅ Validated mathematically
- ✅ Tested for internal consistency
- ✅ Documented with full audit trail

### Verification Process:

1. Each correction sourced from official OpenStax repository
2. Before/after values documented
3. Dependent calculations updated
4. Solutions verified for consistency
5. All changes tested and validated

---

## Not Applied

Approximately 36 corrections were analyzed but not applied because:

- Already correct in markdown version
- CNXML-specific formatting (not applicable)
- Figure/image updates (binary files)
- Cross-reference links (different structure)
- Could not locate matching text

This is expected when converting from CNXML to Markdown format.
