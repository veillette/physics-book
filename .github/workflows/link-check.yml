            ## Broken Links Detected

            The automated link checker has found broken links in the physics book.

            **Check Details:**
            - **Workflow Run:** [\`${context.runId}\`](${context.payload.repository.html_url}/actions/runs/${context.runId})
            - **Branch:** \`${context.ref}\`
            - **Commit:** \`${context.sha.substring(0, 7)}\`

            Please review the workflow logs to see the specific broken links and fix them.

            ### How to Fix:
            1. Check the workflow logs for detailed error messages
            2. Update or remove broken links in the affected files
            3. Test locally with \`npm run check-links\`
            4. Commit your fixes
